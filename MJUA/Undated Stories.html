I was five years old in the beginning,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;My father had a group called the Falcons. They were three brothers, and they played guitars and sang, so there was always a guitar lying around. My brother Tito would pick up the guitar and play, and eventually we would start singing to the playing. We would sing old songs like Cotton Fields Back Home, and some old Ray Charles and James Brown stuff.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&lsquo;This is a true story. Nobody believes it &ndash; a lot of people say, &ldquo;you jiving&rdquo;, but one day our television broke down at our house,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;and what we did to occupy the time, we would just sit around and look at one another. What we decided to do, we would wake up every morning singing songs &ndash; old folk songs like Cotton Fields Back Home and When The Sun Shines and all these kind of things. We would start making harmonies, and the next thing you know that my father had a guitar in his closet and he would go to work. Tito would sneak and play it, and one day Tito got caught and he got a whippin&rsquo;, and after the whippin&rsquo; my father said, &ldquo;Now, let me see what you can play on that thing.&rdquo; And then Tito showed him what he can play and he was proud of him. He couldn&rsquo;t believe it!&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After completing The Wiz, Michael was inundated with offers for several films. One was the story of Frankie Lymon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to do the &lsquo;Frankie Lymon Story&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve listened to his records and think they&rsquo;re great.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ray Newton, event manager on November 9, 1979, &ldquo;Vater Percussion&rdquo; (November 1, 2010) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412105955/https://www.vater.com/vaternews/post/Vater-Artist-Ray-Newton-and-%22Off-The-Wall%22.aspx"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fast forward several years later and I run into Michael Jackson in New York City in a non-entertainment industry environment. I was surprised that he was not with any bodyguards, security, etc. because this was a few years after Thriller and just before Bad was released. I say to Michael &quot;I don&#39;t know if you remember me but we spent the day together in a limo when &quot;Off The Wall&quot; came out. So he gives me a look like he barely remembers me and I look him in the eye and smile then laugh and say &quot;With all the people you&#39;ve had to deal with throughout the world especially since the release of Thriller, I am not even slightly offended if you barely remember me&quot;. Then he smiled and laughed with an expression that said this guy understands. So we talked and he asked me if I was still with the record company, and I said no I am out here doing &quot;the drum thing&quot; on world tours and recordings, etc.. His response was a very positive one word that was the equivalent of saying &quot;Cool !!!&quot;. The conversation went on briefly and I said that I recommended the release of &quot;Rock With You&quot; as a 2nd single from &quot;Off The Wall&quot;. We talked a little bit more and then he shook my hand and turned to walk away. He took one step and just as I was about to walk away he turned around and said &quot;Thank You!!!!&quot;, then he smiled and left.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In this brief conversation that day Michael was the same nice and down-to-earth guy he was with me in the limo several years earlier. This was very amazing considering the success and impact of Thriller worldwide with the young girls in a frenzy and fainting and having to be hospitalized, etc.. The nice and down-to-earth guy who said &quot;Thank You!!!!&quot; to me when he didn&#39;t have to say anything, the &uuml;ber-superstar, and what I can only call &quot;the phenomenon known as Michael Jackson&quot; - that&#39;s the Michael Jackson that I will always remember. Hopefully, the information in this feature will help others to remember him this way too.</span></p></body>
