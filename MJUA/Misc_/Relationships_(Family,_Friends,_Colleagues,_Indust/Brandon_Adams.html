The King of Pop!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The loss of another great one has come upon us this week. Michael Jackson was a legend, an icon, and just an all around good hearted beautiful human being. My heart is very sad with the loss of my friend, there are no words that can express the grief and the pain that I&#39;m feeling in my heart right now. Michael was my idol growing up and he was also my friend. I feel extremely blessed to have had the opportunity to meet him, get to know him, and even work with him. I discovered who I was and the talents that I possess as an individual through the influence of Michael Jackson. He was the greatest entertainer of all time, there will never be another Michael. He has reached so many people with his music all over the world. He was an inspiration for so many out there. I still can&#39;t believe he&#39;s gone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Still to this day, no matter where I go, no matter how many other projects I&#39;ve been involved with, everyone from my friends, to family, my peers, have always said the same thing to me, and that is that I was the luckiest kid in the world to have met and worked with the legendary King of Pop Michael Jackson. Those memories I will forever Cherish and treasure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I also want to take the opportunity to send my condolences and sorrow to all of Michael&#39;s family, friends, and fans all over the world. I know this is a very sad moment for all of us. I will keep my friend MJ in my prayers and will look forward to one day reuniting with him. We all know he&#39;s in a better place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael thank you for giving me those priceless memories and allowing me to be part of your history and life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I will Miss you!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Your friend and best child impersonator,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandon Q.
