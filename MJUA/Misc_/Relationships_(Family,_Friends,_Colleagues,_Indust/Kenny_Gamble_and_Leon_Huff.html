I actually got a chance to watch them create as they presented songs to us and that helped my songwriting a lot. Just watching Huff play the piano while Gamble sang taught me more about the anatomy of a song than anything else. Kenny Gamble is a master melody man. He made me pay closer attention to the melody because of watching him create. And I would watch, too. I&rsquo;d sit there like a hawk, observing every decision, listening to every note. They&rsquo;d come to us in our hotel and play a whole album&rsquo;s worth of music for us. That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;d be introduced to the songs they had chosen for our album&mdash;aside from the two songs we were writing ourselves. It was an amazing thing to be present for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Unknown date of &ldquo;Philadephia International Records&rdquo; album liner notes, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.antimusic.com/news/09/oct/29Michael_Jackson_Home_Movie_Footage_Surfaces.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;antiMusic&rdquo; (October 29, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160908201733/https://www.antimusic.com/news/09/oct/29Michael_Jackson_Home_Movie_Footage_Surfaces.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also paid tribute to Gamble and Huff in liner notes for PIR&#39;s three-CD box set. &quot;There was a message in their music that raised a social consciousness and political awareness without offending,&quot; Jackson wrote. &quot;Theirs is a gift of genius and I love them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Kenny Gamble, album producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.phillytrib.com/entertainment/kenny-gamble-remembers-michael-jackson/article_ac4234e8-b050-5ef8-826f-d0c6c1c526e6.html"><span class="cs8567212B">The Philadelphia Tribune (August 28, 2012)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And so the conclusion that I came up with, after listening to them, I told Michael and Tito and the rest of them, &#39;You know, you guys need to express yourselves, and whatever I can do to help you, I&#39;ll help you.&#39; They were extremely talented, and I told Ron Luxemburg from Epic [Records], &#39;These guys need to produce themselves,&#39; because they had a sound in their heads.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Then, the first album that they produced on themselves was &#39;Destiny,&#39; but the song that was in it was &#39;Shake Your Body Down to the Ground,&quot; and I was like, &#39;Man!&#39; Because their whole thing was dancing! It was a great experience, and Michael used to thank me for showing him how to put a song together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was such a shy person,&quot; Gamble said of the late &quot;King of Pop.&quot; &quot;This guy was such a shy person, but also a very bold person, &#39;cause he was deep inside &mdash; you know how you have something going on? Well, eventually, look what happened. I mean, this guy became the biggest artist in the world! Ever, in the history of the business!&quot;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s very seldom that you find a young 12, 13 year old boy that can sing like that,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, he had a tremendous voice &mdash; this was no kiddie game! This was real singing, and he often gave credit to James Brown and to Smokey Robinson. These are the people that he studied. He studied those people and incorporated all that stuff into himself. He just had something special. It&#39;s just that simple. It&#39;s just a shame that he&#39;s gone, but the thing of it is, who knows when that&#39;s going to happen to any of us? But yeah. This guy, he was something special.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/michael-jackson-the-making-of-a-king-part-2"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Goldmine&rdquo; magazine (April 9, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013124/https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/michael-jackson-the-making-of-a-king-part-2"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We tried to share with him all our experiences and share with him whatever techniques we had in recording,&rdquo; says Gamble. &ldquo;And really, one of the things that he wanted to do was write songs that had a social comment to them. Which Huff and myself, we wrote quite a few songs that talked about love and unity and togetherness amongst all people. And Michael, he gravitated to that, and we also recorded a few songs that had the message and the music. So, later on, Michael started recording songs like &lsquo;We Are The World&rsquo; &hellip; I mean, he wrote some great songs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For his part, Gamble also watched Michael at work, and the future King of Pop kept him on his toes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I learned a lot from [Michael], because he was futuristic in his approach to recording,&rdquo; says Gamble. &ldquo;He knew quite a bit about what he wanted to do and how he wanted it to sound. One example is that he overdubbed his voice maybe about seven or eight times, which I had never done before, and I told him, I said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s try it,&rsquo; because the studio is like a laboratory. You try everything. If it works, it works. If it doesn&rsquo;t, you don&rsquo;t have to have it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Goldmine&rdquo; magazine (Unknown date), From Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I met Michael I guess when he was about 8 or 9 years. Cause he used to come to Philadelphia, and he used to perform at the Uptown Theatre. In fact, he used to come over to my house. All of his brothers, yeah. And we used to have a lot of conversations together. They were just really getting started. Little did I know that later on in life we would have the opportunity to record them, &lsquo;cause I think everybody was in awe of that family.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One song Michael loved so much from Gamble &amp; Huff was a &ldquo;Dreamer, &ldquo;Michael described the song as being perfect and everything about it from the lyrics to the melody he felt was made especially for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the time came for Michael to begin work on his solo album after the Wiz film, he asked Gamble &amp; Huff if they could recommend anyone (they were too busy to take it on at the time). When he told them he was thinking of asking Quincy Jones they told him to go with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110320/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/vibe1995.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; magazine (June/July 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gamble: When we took Michael in the studio to overdub his voice, he had so many different ideas about songs, writing, and producing, I told him he could really record himself. He was very curious about a lot of things. He&rsquo;s a creative, spiritual, caring person.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nineteen eighty-one&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rock With You&rdquo; is the most what Michael&rsquo;s about. I really believe he and Quincy have a magic together. Michael is a miracle.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Huff: When Michael and his brothers first came to Philadelphia, Gamble decided to walk them from the hotel to the studio. As they were walking, they were rushed by a group of girls. The brothers escaped by going into a movie theater. Once they made it to the studio, these girls camped outside the studio&mdash;and this was for a six-month period. To see 100 girls laying outside a studio at 3 and 4 in the morning for Michael and his brothers was something else.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My favorite Michael song? Nineteen eighty-seven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show You the Way to Go.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
