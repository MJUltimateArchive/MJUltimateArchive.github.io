		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito Jackson</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mirror (July 15, 2009)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito Jackson sat crying alone in his car after sister Janet broke the devastating news that his brother had died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He had been racing to the Los Angeles hospital where Michael was taken after suffering a suspected heart attack.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito, 55, phoned his pop star sister en route to get the latest update on his younger brother&rsquo;s condition.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She ordered him to pull over on a bustling LA freeway &ndash; and then gave him the awful news that Jackson had passed away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fighting back tears, Tito said: &ldquo;The day started badly because I woke up and heard that Farrah Fawcett had died. Later, I went to my local Starbucks for a coffee.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When I got home, I got a phone call from my son Taryll. He said, &lsquo;Pops, is that true what they are saying about Uncle Michael?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;What are they saying?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re saying they are rushing him to hospital in cardiac arrest&rsquo;. I tried to reach my mom but wasn&rsquo;t able to get through right way, so I turned on the TV.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;All I saw was the ambulance pulling up to the hospital from the helicopter shot. Finally, I called my cousin Trent, because he is my mom&rsquo;s right-hand man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Trent, where&rsquo;s Mom?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s here, we haven&rsquo;t got to the hospital yet but your mother says you should come down&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I heard that and thought, &lsquo;Oh no, something must really be wrong if she&rsquo;s saying we should go down&rsquo;. I was in the car when I called my sister Janet to ask if if she had heard anything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;She asked me where I was and I told her I was on my way to the hospital.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Are you driving?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m driving.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Pull over&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s when I knew something was really wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Janet, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to pull over, Tito&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;No, Janet, what&rsquo;s wrong!&rsquo; She finally made me pull over and said Michael had passed away. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It just killed me. I just sat in the car and cried.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While the rest of the family went to the hospital to see Jackson&rsquo;s body, distraught Tito went to his mother&rsquo;s house in Encino.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I decided I couldn&rsquo;t face it at the hospital. It was a like a zoo over there and anyway, I didn&rsquo;t want to see Michael&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The others got to see him in that state but I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t see him like that. I always knew him as an energetic, live person and that&rsquo;s the way I want to remember him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Instead I went to my mom&rsquo;s house and sat there by myself, trying to come to terms with everything. Mom was the first one back.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When she walked in, I rushed over and hugged her and she was crying. She was really sad. Prince, Paris and Blanket were with her. They were fine &ndash; children take things differently. They had not realised the magnitude of it at the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I spoke to them but didn&rsquo;t talk about anything that had happened. I just gave them a hug and told them I loved them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They had all their little cousins there, so, being kids, they played with their dog. We kept them away from the TV because we didn&rsquo;t want them watching the news.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito was invited to the open-casket viewing of Michael&#39;s body at Forest Lawn cemetery in Hollywood, but decided he couldn&rsquo;t face it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d seen him there, that would have been my last memory of him. That would have stuck with me in my mind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was given the chance to go there, and that left me imagining what it would look like, what Michael&rsquo;s body would look like.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Even now I have nightmares about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The family felt it was good to let family and friends see Michael for one last time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito said: &ldquo;Jermaine didn&rsquo;t go either. He said his goodbyes at the hospital and didn&rsquo;t want to see his brother in that state again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The following day, the entire clan attended a private service at Forest Lawn, where Tito saw Jackson&rsquo;s gold-plated coffin for the first time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said: &ldquo;When I walked into the chapel I immediately started crying because I knew he was in there. It really hit home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the service, the family travelled to the Staples Center in downtown LA for Jackson&rsquo;s memorial. Tito said: &ldquo;When I walked in, I felt that Michael was in the building, not just in body but also in spirit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I felt his smile because so many people were there that loved him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They came to mourn and to celebrate his legacy. If Michael could have commented he would have given the whole thing an AAA+.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Asked about rumours that Jackson&rsquo;s body was not in the coffin, Tito replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, totally not true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He recalled the heart-rending moment Paris spoke about her dad on stage at the end of the emotional service. &ldquo;Her speech was not planned,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She just wanted to tell the whole world that her father was a good daddy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That was so healthy for her, to tell everyone, &lsquo;No matter what anyone says, my daddy was a good daddy&rsquo;. She got it off her chest. She needed to do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito last saw Michael at an anniversary dinner for his parents Katherine and Joe &ndash; just three weeks before his death.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The get-together was held at the Indian restaurant Chakra in Beverly Hills, one of Michael&rsquo;s favourite places to eat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito said: &ldquo;The whole family showed up including Michael and his kids.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was in great spirits. He looked good. He seemed to be himself and I was not really worried about him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I had heard he was doing the shows and going to rehearsal and getting his whole thing back where he belonged.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was so proud of him. I had even made arrangements to go to England to see his performance, check him out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He always called me TT, never Tito.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;At the end of the night he hugged me, said, &lsquo;Bye, TT&rsquo; and whispered, &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; in my ear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; and gave him a hug.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That was the last time I ever saw or spoke to him.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
