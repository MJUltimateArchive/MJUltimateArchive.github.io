He&rsquo;s the only guy I&rsquo;ve ever met that&rsquo;s real&mdash;for that kind of music. I grew up listening to The Jackson 5. I used to love &ldquo;Dancing Machine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We&#39;ve been friends for a while, so he just lets me do what I want to do. I get a basic framework, and I just make up my part and they edit it. I wonder sometimes what it&rsquo;s gonna sound like, [Laughs] but every time, they do a great job. He&rsquo;s very shrewd. He&rsquo;s got a great, sarcastic sense of humor. People always ask me, &ldquo;Is he weird?&rdquo; Well, he&rsquo;s different. But I know what it&rsquo;s like to be weird, growing up in the music business.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I have to admit working with Michael Jackson is different than working with your basic, gritty rock n&#39; roll band. One time when I went to play for Michael, he walked in with Brooke Shields, and there I am with a cigarette in one hand, a bottle of Jack Daniel&rsquo;s in the other, and my guitar hanging low around my neck. And he doesn&rsquo;t care. That&rsquo;s not the way he is, but I don&rsquo;t have to change for him. He accepts me for what I am.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104437/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article16.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; magazine (August 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: All over the world, the press lapped [rumors about his personal life] up. Why, and how did he do these things, and was he given a fair crack of the whip by the press?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Slash: We&#39;ve gotten to be friends over the years. He&#39;s definitely not what the public perceives him as. He&#39;s not a little kid. He may dig little kids, but he&#39;s not naive and as child-like as he makes out. He&#39;s very sly. He&#39;s got a very sarcastic sense of humor. He&#39;s a funny guy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Q: With all the accusations, did you ever have any doubts about working with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Slash: When I was asked to do the record during the middle of all that, I talked to him and he was real secretive and it was real hard to get in touch with him. But I just wanted to let him know that shit happens basically. I know him well enough to know that none of that stuff is really true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But when they asked me to do it, just for a second I thought, &quot;Oh boy, do I really want to get involved?&quot;, and then I thought, &quot;Well, wait a second, there&#39;s no way that I&#39;m not going to play with a friend of mine just because he&#39;s going through some controversy, so I just went straight there and did it.</span></p></body>
