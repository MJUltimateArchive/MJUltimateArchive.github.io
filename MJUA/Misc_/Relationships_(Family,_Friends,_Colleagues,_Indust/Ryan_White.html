In the spring John and I planned to go down to the Speedway in Indianapolis to watch the cars and drivers warm up for the Indy 500. Since that was a while off, we spent our time at electronics stores, looking at new stereos we wanted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then one day Michael Jackson called me. Wow! I didn&rsquo;t know why he had, except maybe because he&rsquo;s from Indiana too. He was in his car, he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;If I lose you, man, I&rsquo;ll call you back,&rdquo; he told me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I told him what I was doing, what movies I&rsquo;d seen, what school was like, how John and I had been window-shopping for stereos&mdash;stuff I&rsquo;d talk about to anyone. I said I was playing his albums. I liked &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; the best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s not flaky or weird, like you read in those newspapers you can buy in the supermarket. He&rsquo;s real quiet and soft-spoken. Sometimes he takes a while to say things. He&rsquo;s just kind of gentle and peaceful. He was a nice new friend for me to have.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Next time you&rsquo;re in L.A., we&rsquo;ll get together and have some good old fun,&rdquo; he told me. Well, I couldn&rsquo;t wait. But it was going to take us a while to get back to California.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;[June 1988]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;While we were at Disneyland, we checked out the 3-D movie of Michael as Captain EO, which I had already seen before. I planned to talk to him about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the day we were going to spend with Michael, a limo picked up Mom, Andrea, Heather, and me very early at our hotel. After we climbed in, we were told that we couldn&rsquo;t take any cameras with us because we weren&rsquo;t allowed to take pictures. About three hours later, about ten in the morning, we drove up to the entrance of Neverland, Michael&rsquo;s ranch. We had to stop and let the security guards check us out again. They escorted us to the main house. Michael was busy, we were told; he&rsquo;d be there in about a half hour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So we had some sodas and Heather, Andrea, and I found a game room. The girls started on the video games. I climbed into an airplane that rocked around just as if it were really flying. All of a sudden, I caught a glimpse of Michael, playing along with the girls. I kept trying to look around at him and say hello, but I was trapped! I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to stop the plane. No one else could either, so finally Michael had to stop laughing and unplug it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was wearing black pants and a red and black jacket and a black hat. He always wears my favorite colors. He showed us around the main house. Just like me, his dream is to have kids, so the house had a bedroom for a little boy and one for a little girl, plus a playroom with all kinds of toys and arts and crafts&mdash;even a miniature merry-go-round. Just like me, he collects things, especially dolls that are about three feet tall and look very lifelike. Mom loved them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides the main house, the ranch has a pool, four bungalows for guests, and an old-time movie theater, with a popcorn machine and candy and a soda fountain. You use golf carts to get from one building to another, and to see the animals that are outdoors. There&rsquo;s Michael&rsquo;s giraffe, and cows that graze on his land but really belong to other ranchers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At lunch&mdash;chicken, corn on the cob, and pumpkin pie&mdash;we met Michael&rsquo;s monkeys. His famous one, Bubbles, wasn&rsquo;t there, but the others made up for him. They all wore diapers and T-shirts in different colors. They have their own baby-sitters, and they go to school every day to learn manners. Their manners were pretty good! They hopped around and played with our shoelaces while we ate. Every now and again Michael fed them a treat. I never wanted to say good-bye to them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I felt very comfortable around Michael because I could see he was just as shy as I am. He seemed like a regular person to me. I certainly could relax with him. At lunch there was juice and Pepsi. Mom asked if there was any Coke. Then she remembered Michael&rsquo;s Pepsi commercial. She really thought she&rsquo;d blown it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael smiled. He knew what she was thinking. He said that Mom was just like his mother. So Mom got up the nerve to ask a mom-type question. &ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is it true that you sleep in an oxygen tank?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s something the tabloids have said about him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael laughed. &ldquo;Now Jeanne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know all the stuff that&rsquo;s been written about you and Ryan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh gosh,&rdquo; Mom said. &ldquo;I understand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After lunch Michael asked me if I&rsquo;d like to ride around part of the ranch in his four-wheeler. &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; I said. Andrea was going to try his trampoline, and Heather and Mom were checking out his outdoor hot tub that had a video screen on one side.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and I set out over the ranch&rsquo;s dirt roads. I was at the wheel and he rode in the back. I took off and Michael yelled, &ldquo;Slow down, Ryan!&rdquo; After we&rsquo;d gone a few miles he asked me if I could find my way back to the house.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I said. I listed a few landmarks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;But now let me drive!&rdquo; When we caught up with Mom and the girls, it was getting late. We had homemade pizza for supper, and then it was time for us to drive back to L.A. I told Michael that I really, really wanted a photo of us together. So he sent someone out for a Polaroid camera, and drove down with us to the ranch&rsquo;s entrance. Mom got some good shots, and then we said good-bye.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the limo headed for the highway, Heather covered her face with her hands, shook her hair back and forth, and started laughing and laughing and laughing. She&rsquo;d gotten excited when we went to see </span><span class="cs43C038A">Cats</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> in New York and the actors dressed as cats came down into the audience. But not like this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t believe it! I just can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We spent the day with Michael Jackson. </span><span class="cs43C038A">I can&rsquo;t believe we were with Michael Jackson</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[August 1988]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Back home Andrea was making a giant comeback in roller skating. In July she finished first at the regionals in Detroit. [ ] The nationals were going to be held in August in Fort Worth. [ ]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Andrea did great. She finished third. She was pleased, she said, because the girls who took first and second were better than she was. Finally, there was another White in the newspapers and magazines.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Right around then, a car salesman in Noblesville called me. &ldquo;I have a red Mustang here for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Michael Jackson.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mom wasn&rsquo;t overcome with shock. She had some idea what was coming. Michael&rsquo;s office had called and asked her, &ldquo;Now what was the car Ryan told Michael he liked?&rdquo; Michael and I kept up with each other on the phone. Sometimes we talked twice a week, a lot of the time about cars. And when I thought back, I remembered that Michael had seen me by the pool at the ranch, leafing through </span><span class="cs43C038A">Mustang Monthly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mom, Andrea, and I rode over together to pick up my new car. I started grinning like a Halloween pumpkin when I saw it. It was exactly what I wanted: red with a black and gray plaid interior and a sunroof. It even had oversized tires and deluxe wheels&mdash;really fancy for a Mustang. I put on my Oakleys and took off. I wanted to show it to everyone I knew. I had an appointment with Dr. Kleiman at the hospital in Indianapolis, so I whizzed down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the hospital parking lot, I had to back up in a hurry. I forgot to check my rear view. All of a sudden I felt a thud and heard a loud crunch. Uh-oh. I looked in the mirror&mdash;a little bit late. I could see a man with a beard pounding his fists on his steering wheel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I got out and walked back to his car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real sorry, Dr. Kleiman,&rdquo; I said. This wasn&rsquo;t exactly how I&rsquo;d planned to show off my car. Thank goodness there was no damage! Whew.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I think Dr. Kleiman&rsquo;s mad at me,&rdquo; I told Mom that night. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe what I did . . .&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Time to write to Michael. &ldquo;Thanks a million for the Mustang,&rdquo; I started out. &ldquo;Gee, IT&rsquo;S GREAT. It really brightened up my summer. It came just in time too. The local Mustang club is having a show with hundreds of old and new Mustangs.&rdquo; Steve Ford and I had been looking forward to it. I told Michael, &ldquo;Now I can enter mine and join the club.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I STARTED my junior year, but that didn&rsquo;t keep me off the road. I was in my car every spare minute. Everyone in town knew my car and how I&rsquo;d gotten it. </span><span class="cs43C038A">It</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was famous! Kids asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Michael Jackson really like? How about Kareem?&rdquo; Adults asked too. I said, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo; Or I mumbled something I hoped wouldn&rsquo;t attract much attention&mdash;I knew some kids were jealous, thinking I had such a great life knowing celebrities. I guess they forgot I was also sick.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One day Mom was in the school office borrowing a copy of </span><span class="cs43C038A">USA Today.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> She wanted to see a photo they&rsquo;d run of me. Someone had scrawled in the margin, &ldquo;I hope you DIE!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask that kid if he&rsquo;d swap places with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I bet the answer would be the longest silence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Autumn 1989]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">EVERY SUMMER I feel like I&rsquo;m over AIDS, and in the fall, when it turns cold, I always feel chilled and I&rsquo;m sick again. This fall I had a hernia, which meant that it hurt to sit, stand, or walk. My liver was acting up, and sometimes my stomach was so bloated I couldn&rsquo;t see my feet. I looked like I was having a baby. I was having fevers again, and I felt like I&rsquo;d been coughing my whole life. For a third of it, I had. I sounded like a weak car battery, turning over and over and over again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By October I was too worn-out to go to school for more than a couple of days in a row. Just carrying my books from my locker to class was enough to drag me out. It didn&rsquo;t help to think that I should have graduated by now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To top off my troubles, Heather and I decided to go our separate ways. I missed her. I hoped we&rsquo;d end up being best friends again. I knew she&rsquo;d put up with some bad stuff on my account. She had had nasty notes left in her locker too. One time I called her at her baby-sitting job, and some other sitter answered. I tracked Heather down at home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;How come you&rsquo;re not working?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I lost the job,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do?&rdquo; I asked, just to be pesky.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your friend,&rdquo; she reminded me. &ldquo;The woman said she couldn&rsquo;t take the chance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That was Heather&rsquo;s second baby-sitting job gone for the same reason. I felt sad she&rsquo;d had to pay for hanging out with me. And I felt almost eighteen and very lonely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had to go into the hospital so Dr. Kleiman could decide what to do about my hernia. I was lying around waiting for the next test when another doctor walked into my room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well, Ryan,&rdquo; she said in a super-cheerful way. &ldquo;Any girlfriends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For a moment I looked at her blankly. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what she was driving at. Then something clicked in my head. I was going to get a lecture on safe sex.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&rsquo;t get upset over IVs and all the stuff that happens to you in the hospital. But now I was fuming.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dr. Kleiman?&rdquo; I yelled. I could hardly speak. </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> my doctor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The woman doctor left in a hurry. When Dr. Kleiman showed up, I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever want her coming near me again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dr. Kleiman promised.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After all the tests, Dr. Kleiman said the doctors couldn&rsquo;t operate on my hernia because thanks to AIDS, my blood platelet count was too low. Even with Factor and transfusions of platelets, my blood wouldn&rsquo;t clot enough. Surgery was too dangerous. There was nothing anyone could do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I just had to live with the pain. Well, I would. I had bad days, when just taking a shower and getting dressed was enough to exhaust me. But I always got dressed. I never was bedridden. I knew I had good days too, and I wanted to be ready. Plus I was still waiting to meet the right girl.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[December 1989. Michael Jackson was busy working on the &ldquo;Decade&rdquo; album that would later turn into &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I turned eighteen in December, I was in poor shape. [ ] On bad days I had to rely on the phone for social life. Michael called to say he was busy working on an album. He was in the studio every day. In between he had to pose for pictures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; I said. I knew what </span><span class="cs43C038A">that</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was like. &ldquo;You have to smile for so long! Then the photographer says something corny like, &lsquo;Smile just like you smiled earlier!&rsquo; I always want to say, &lsquo;Give me a mirror so I can check.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get together and goof off again,&rdquo; Michael said. He wanted to know if I could come back out to the ranch after Christmas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, when Michael invites you, you don&rsquo;t say maybe. Dr. Kleiman knew I wanted to keep going, and that trips to California kept me going. I could count on him to get me on that plane. So I told Michael, &ldquo;You can bet on it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip; I was waiting for Dr. Kleiman to declare me fit to travel. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what he&rsquo;d say. I had a big stomach that day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Carrie!&rdquo; I said, pulling up my shirt. &ldquo;I look like you did when you were pregnant!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, Carrie&rsquo;s seen it all, but for a split-second, she looked shocked. That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;d been hoping for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Kleiman saw no reason why I couldn&rsquo;t visit Michael. I love Christmas, but this year I couldn&rsquo;t wait for December 28, when I was taking off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[December 28, 1989]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[When Ryan White arrived in Los Angeles Michael Jackson was staying in town and they picked him up at his Hideout apartment on the way to Neverland. At the ranch Ryan stayed in one of the guest units &ndash; Bungalow Three as he had to take a nap time and again]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ryan White is on his way to Neverland, Dec.1989</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;At last I left for L.A. in a new leather jacket that I thought looked pretty cool. Michael&rsquo;s security people met me in a limo. I called Mom from the limo to let her know I had arrived okay. We picked up Michael at his apartment, and then headed south for the ranch. Michael said he thought I looked better than I had on my last visit in June. I hoped he was right. Maybe the jacket helped.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The drive took about three hours. The limo dropped me off at Bungalow Three for a rest. Michael said, &ldquo;See you at seven.&rdquo; That was suppertime. I was worried. My stomach ached and I was having cramps. I called Mom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have come,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be sick here with Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t eaten in a while,&rdquo; Mom pointed out. I usually needed at least a snack every couple of hours or so. She said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you see how you feel after supper?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I took a nap and went up to the main house for supper&mdash;chicken, beef ribs, and baked potatoes. Then Michael and I went to his private theater and watched two and a half hours of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Three Stooges</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> reruns. We ate popcorn from the theater&rsquo;s own machine, and had pizza delivered from the house. I felt a lot better and had a great time. Now I was glad I had come.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael had told me to call the house the next morning when I woke up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[December 29, 1989]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[At the time of Ryan White&rsquo;s stay at the ranch he was attended to by Mark Quindoy, the housekeeper and his wife Faye. The Quindoys later made their allegations about &lsquo;boys at Neverland&rsquo; during their short time there, at some point asking $500,000 for their memoirs but eventually getting nothing. During his interviews Mark Quindoy gave no indication that his memoirs included Ryan White ]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Mark, the ranch manager, and his wife did all the cooking. They gave me a list of choices for breakfast and told me, &ldquo;Anything you want, we&rsquo;ll fix it.&rdquo; I picked French toast and bacon. My room was a little chilly, even though I&rsquo;d brought my heater with me. So they brought me another portable heater and an electric blanket.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I like your jacket,&rdquo; Michael told me, &ldquo;but I want you to have a heavier one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Ryan on his way to visit Michael Jackson in California, where Michael bought Ryan a heavier jacket, December 1989.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the two of us drove to a nearby town in Michael&rsquo;s Bentley. I can&rsquo;t name the town, because Michael likes the ranch to stay a private place. We couldn&rsquo;t find the jacket Michael had in mind, but he did buy four or five dolls for other kids. The best part was, the man in the shop didn&rsquo;t believe that Michael and his credit card were for real! Michael gave him the ranch&rsquo;s security number, and he called to clear the card and to doublecheck that Michael was who he said he was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was very happy that dinner turned out to be tacos. Afterward I showed Michael a video that Mom, Andrea, and I had made for him of our whole house&mdash;every room, every poster and decoration we have on the walls, Andrea&rsquo;s skating trophies and my collections. In the video, we took him on a guided tour, waving and clowning at the camera.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When you come to visit now,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll know your way around our house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That night we watched the new Indiana Jones movie, </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Last Crusade.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How lucky can you get, I thought.

Michael had a video crew come in, and we made a tape together about our friendship&mdash;kind of the flip side of the video we had made for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[December 31]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;At dinner on New Year&rsquo;s Eve Michael gave me a wonderful watch.

I&rsquo;d have to lean against the tile for a few minutes before I had enough energy to dry myself off and get dressed. Between my swollen stomach and my hernia, I often walked half bent over.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My shingles had cleared up, but now I had open sores on my legs. Mom had to change the bandages every few hours. My throat was very sore and I could hardly breathe in the cold. Because of my hemophilia, I&rsquo;d get blood clots in my nose, and then I sniffed so much people thought I was making faces at them. Michael had invited me back in the spring. Now that my legs looked so bad, I&rsquo;d never be able to go out on the public beach in Florida over spring break.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was having trouble with my liver, so Dr. Kleiman put me on a protein drink. Otherwise, he said, I&rsquo;d have to have nutrition through an IV. I&rsquo;d have to stay hooked up for hours every day. I was supposed to mix the protein drink with juice or Sprite. Even so, it tasted sickening. Dr. Kleiman wanted me to have it seven times a day, but I&rsquo;d only managed to get up to four.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Between coughing and struggling to breathe, I was also having trouble sleeping. When I lay awake, I worried about school. I didn&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;d be going back. When I did, I&rsquo;d be way behind. But I didn&rsquo;t have the strength to keep up with assignments at home. I watched TV and buried myself in my car magazines. Sometimes I read car-parts catalogs until three or four in the morning, when I could finally sleep a little.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had big plans. I spent hours polishing the Mustang Michael had given me. I flew off the handle if the cat walked over it and left dusty prints on the roof. I had gotten tinted windows, but I wanted to customize the whole thing. I spent hours talking to Steve, John, Michael&mdash;anyone I knew who cared about cars.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[ ] Lately I didn&rsquo;t want to talk about much except cars.

Michael would have two minutes to speak. &ldquo;Ryan,&rdquo; Elton said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t turn down a superstar like this. I&rsquo;m grade B compared to Michael.&rdquo; He held the phone to Ryan&rsquo;s ear so Michael could encourage him.

On stage he announced, &ldquo;This one&rsquo;s for Ryan,&rdquo; and began singing &ldquo;Candle in the Wind.&rdquo; Andrea and Heather were watching in the wings. As the song ended and the crowd applauded, they waited for Elton, but he rushed past them without saying a word. They knew he had been calling the hospital every fifteen minutes, so Ryan must have gotten worse. They raced back to Riley.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time Andrea, Heather, and Elton got back from the concert, Dr. Kleiman was convinced that Ryan would not last much longer. His blood pressure had dropped to dangerously low levels, and was still falling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At about one o&rsquo;clock Sunday morning, Michael Jackson called again from Atlantic City. When Jeanne told him Ryan was not expected to live, Michael declared he was flying to Indianapolis right away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[April 8, 1990]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RYAN DIED at 7:11 A.M. on April 8, 1990. It was Palm Sunday. Jeanne gave him one last kiss and then turned off his guardian angel night-light. Andrea hugged him for a long time; she did not want to leave him by himself. So Laura told her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with him until he&rsquo;s ready to go to the funeral home.&rdquo; In a room near Ryan&rsquo;s, Reverend Probasco gathered Jeanne, Andrea, Ryan&rsquo;s grandparents, his uncles, aunts, cousins, Elton, Heather, and some other friends in a circle. They clasped hands to pray and say good-bye to Ryan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As soon as Michael Jackson arrived, he went straight to the Whites&rsquo; home in Cicero. He was very upset that he hadn&rsquo;t gotten there before Ryan died. He went up to Ryan&rsquo;s room, which was full of his collections, posters, and souvenirs, including his director&rsquo;s chair from the movie set. In it sat a giant toy gorilla that Ryan had spotted in New Orleans and that the National Education Association sent him. On the walls were Alyssa Milano&rsquo;s friendship bracelet, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Max Headroom</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> posters, and the hearts needlepointed by Kris, Ryan&rsquo;s old girlfriend in Kokomo. Hanging from the ceiling was a real parachute, a present from Aunt Janet, and a thousand paper cranes&mdash;Japanese symbols of long life that an Indiana school had folded for Ryan from colored papers. In the closet was the heavy new leather jacket Michael had wanted him to wear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, a fellow G.I. Joe collector, sat quietly looking at everything for a long time. He told Jeanne he felt close to Ryan in his room. Jeanne offered him anything he liked there as a keepsake, but he asked her to leave Ryan&rsquo;s room just as it was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the Whites&rsquo; front yard sat the red Mustang Michael had given Ryan. Now it was covered with flowers and Easter eggs, gifts from children. Andrea took Michael out to show him the car and they sat in it together. When Michael turned on the CD player, Ryan&rsquo;s favorite song, Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; began to play. Michael smiled proudly. He knew it must have been the last song Ryan had played.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jeanne told Michael she had recorded a phone conversation he&rsquo;d had with Ryan. She was afraid Michael might be offended, but he said he wished she&rsquo;d recorded all their talks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The morning of the funeral, April 11, was cold, windy, and drizzly. Outside the largest church in Indianapolis, long lines of people in their best clothes waited to view Ryan&rsquo;s body. Since Ryan never took his fame seriously, Jeanne thought he&rsquo;d be astonished. She said, &ldquo;I bet he was looking down and laughing. He must have been saying, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe all you silly people are getting wet to see </span><span class="cs43C038A">me.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fifteen hundred squeezed inside the church for the funeral service. Elton played the piano, led the congregation in a hymn, and sang &ldquo;Skyline Pigeon,&rdquo; his song about a bird soaring toward freedom. The First Lady Barbara Bush, Michael Jackson, Howie Long, and Phil Donahue&mdash;who with his wife Marlo Thomas became close friends with the Whites after Ryan answered kids&rsquo; questions about AIDS on his talk show&mdash;sat up front with Andrea, Jeanne, her parents, her brother and sister, Steve Ford, Ryan&rsquo;s cousins, and Wayne White.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reverend Probasco gave the eulogy. He told how Ryan and his family had hoped for a miracle&mdash;that Ryan would be cured. That hadn&rsquo;t happened. But the minister went on, &ldquo;I believe God gave us that miracle in Ryan. He healed a wounded spirit and made it whole.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Many of you who are here are very successful,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Your lives are filled with glamour and fame. Yet you brought Ryan and his cause into your lives and aided him in his mission and showed us how to do the same.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Now I challenge all of us to accept his faith. For you see, Ryan was successful too, in getting all of us involved. He helped us to care and to believe that with God&rsquo;s help, nothing is impossible&mdash;even for a kid.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
