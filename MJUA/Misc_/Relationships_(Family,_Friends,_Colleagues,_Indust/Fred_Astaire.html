He makes these moves up himself and it is just great to watch. I think he just feels that way when he is singing those songs. I don&#39;t know how much more dancing he will take up, because singing and dancing at the same time is very difficult. But Michael is a dedicated artist. He dreams, thinks of it all the time. You can see what the result is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &ldquo;Fred Astaire: His Friends Talk&rdquo; (1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I could only repeat what has been said and written about Fred Astaire&rsquo;s perfectionism and enormous, one-of-a-kind artistry. What I can reflect on is the inspiration he afforded me personally, being privileged as I was to see him work his magic. Nobody could duplicate Mr. Astaire&rsquo;s ability, but what I never stop trying to emulate is his total discipline, his absolute dedication to every aspect of his art. He rehearsed, rehearsed, and rehearsed some more, until he got it just the way he wanted it. It was Fred Astaire&rsquo;s work ethic that few people ever discussed and even few could ever hope to equal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Gold&rdquo; magazine interview (November 2002)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GG: &quot;Was Fred Astaire your friend?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yes. Fred Astaire was my neighbor. I used to see him every day when I was riding my little motorscooter. He always told me, he would always say when I was a little kid, &#39;You&#39;re gonna be a big star.&#39; He told me that he thought I was an incredible entertainer and a great mover. And he always used to say, &#39;You&#39;re the best,&#39; and I&#39;d say, &#39;No, you&#39;re the best.&#39;</span></p></body>
