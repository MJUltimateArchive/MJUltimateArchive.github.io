How did you guys meet and, you know, how did your collaboration go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He was this guy who went around Hollywood and around the industry saying his dream was to work with me to everybody. Then at Carol Bayer Sager&#39;s house, who&#39;s this great song writer; won several academy awards for her songwriting, said, &quot;There&#39;s a guy I used to work with. His name is Rodney Jerkins, he&#39;s been crying to me begging to meet you. I mean, why don&#39;t you pick up the phone and say &#39;hi&#39; to him.&quot; And he came over that day and he said, &quot;Please, my dream is to work with you. Will you give me two weeks and I&#39;ll see what I can come up with.&quot; And uh, we ended up working together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeCurtis:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And what were your impressions of him, like as just somebody... What did he bring; what did you feel that his contribution was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> His contribution was he loves to create in the same kind of way that I like to create. But I pushed Rodney. And pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed him to create... uh, to innovate more. To pioneer more. He&#39;s a real musician. He&#39;s a real musician and he&#39;s very dedicated and he&#39;s real loyal. He has perseverance. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen perseverance like his in anyone. Because you can push him and push him and he doesn&#39;t get angry. Yeah, I think he&#39;s a great guy, he really is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; magazine (1999) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423133955/www.michael-jackson-trader.com/news/1999/November/index.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My association with Michael came about after I was introduced to Carole Bayer Sager by Atlantic VP Craig Kaman. She asked me if I would like to come to her house and write with her and Michael. So I said, Cool. I flew to Los Angeles, and sure enough Michael was there at her house. We just caught a good vibe, and I&#39;ve been working on his album for about six, seven months now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Working with Michael... Oh my God, it&#39;s incredible! Every time I see him, I tell him over and over, It&#39;s incredible just to be here working with you, knowing how crazy I was about you when I was a kid.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://apnews.com/77fb6ccd88f240cfb9a6952502def6ed"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Associated Press&rdquo; (May 2, 2014)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200226161511/https://apnews.com/77fb6ccd88f240cfb9a6952502def6ed"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael Jackson&rsquo;s record label released his first posthumous album in 2010, a year after the King of Pop&rsquo;s sudden death, producer Rodney &ldquo;Darkchild&rdquo; Jerkins was asked to work on the project.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He declined.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was asked to be on that album and to produce like five songs, but I turned it down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just felt like it wasn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Years later, the hitmaker for Destiny&rsquo;s Child and Whitney Houston &mdash; who worked heavily on Jackson&rsquo;s 2001 comeback album, &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; &mdash; says he now feels comfortable producing Jackson&rsquo;s music again. He produced the title track from the upcoming album, &ldquo;Xscape,&rdquo; out May 13.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;For me it wasn&rsquo;t about the label, it wasn&rsquo;t about the estate&rsquo;s approval; it wasn&rsquo;t about all of that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had a personal relationship with Michael, (so) it was about, &lsquo;What would he want from this? What would he want it to sound like now?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Xscape&rdquo; was executive produced by Timbaland and includes songs Jackson recorded in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of the tracks are taken from early recording sessions for successful albums such as &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dangerous.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first single, &ldquo;Love Never Felt So Good,&rdquo; was written with Paul Anka and premiered at the iHeartRadio Music Awards on Thursday night when Usher danced to the song. A bonus version of the track features Justin Timberlake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jerkins said he and Jackson originally started work on the song &ldquo;Xscape&rdquo; in 1999 when they recorded the &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; album. He revisited the track in 2003 and retouched it this year for the new eight-track album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Even when Michael was alive, we never stopped working on the song &lsquo;Xscape,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was one of those songs where he specifically said to me, &lsquo;It has to see the light of day one day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jerkins said he visited Jackson in 2007 in Ireland where they were &ldquo;vibing out,&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t focus on creating music exclusively.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And I then I spoke to him &mdash; I would say 2008, 2009, something like that &mdash; and he was telling me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m getting ready to do another album. You gotta get to work. Start working on ideas,&rsquo;&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;And then he passed away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jerkins, who has produced hits for Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Brandy, is working on new music with Rihanna and Ariana Grande. He said he was initially nervous about including &ldquo;Xscape&rdquo; on the Jackson album, which also includes a song produced by StarGate, whom Jackson initially wanted to collaborate with in 2007 because of the Swedish team&rsquo;s work with Ne-Yo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the other stuff going to sound like?&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t even know if I want my song to be on there if the other stuff ain&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; Jerkins said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But after the hearing the full record, he relaxed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Everyone did a really great job on this project,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6077455/michael-jackson-billboard-cover-story-xscape-full-album-details"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Billboard&rdquo; (May 5, 2014)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145503/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6077455/michael-jackson-billboard-cover-story-xscape-full-album-details"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He asked me [to work with him] for a year,&quot; says Jerkins of Jackson.
