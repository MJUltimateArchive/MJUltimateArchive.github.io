I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation, but you know how babies move uncoordinated? He never moved that way. WHen he danced, it was like he was an older person.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;There have been lots of rumors about Michael, that has had operations to have his eyes widened and his cheeks changed and everything. Those things are simply not true. He had only one operations, on his nose. We were hoping you&#39;d set the record straight and put a stop to the rumors. They also say Michael is gay. Michael isn&#39;t gay. It&#39;s against his religion. It&#39;s against God. The Bible speaks against it.&quot; Joe Jackson repeats, &quot;Michael isn&#39;t gay.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37936651/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/michael-jackson-mothers-story/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Dateline&rdquo; (June 25, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190413054434/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37936651/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/michael-jackson-mothers-story/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You remember when they used to show the little African kids starving to death, flies all around their mouth? We, Michael and I, would lay there on the floor watching TV&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael would look up at me and said, &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;one day&rsquo; &ndash; he was only a kid then &ndash; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something about this.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I never looked at him after he passed. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like doing that. I wanted to remember him smiling and laughing and having a good time the last time I saw him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;[Regarding allegations] He used to come to me sometimes and tell me, and he said, &lsquo;Mother, just think of what I love most in this world are children, and I&rsquo;d rather slit my own wrist before I hurt a child, and this is what they&rsquo;re trying to pin on me.&rsquo; And I just want them to know that Michael wasn&rsquo;t like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...[Regarding those after Michael&rsquo;s money] He felt that people wanted him gone, wanted him dead. He would always say that. And, for him to say that, he must have known something. It&rsquo;s just some of the mean, evil, vicious people didn&rsquo;t want him around for some reason. They&rsquo;re greedy. That&rsquo;s what it is. Don&rsquo;t take that out. They are greedy.</span></p></body>
