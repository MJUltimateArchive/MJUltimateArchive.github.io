I was stymied until the voice asked, &quot;Did you write a book about Walt Disney?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I admitted I had authored &quot;Walt Disney, An American Original.&quot; I also recognized the voice by now - Michael Jackson - remembering he had a passion for all things Disney.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;d like to talk to you about Walt,&quot; he said urgently, and I agreed. The date was set for the following evening at his family compound in the San Fernando Valley community of Encino, which is just a few blocks from my house.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I arrived at the property and announced myself to a receptionist on the other end of an intercom. A massive gate opened slowly and I drove down a narrow passageway and stopped in front of a building containing offices. I looked around and thought I saw a tall tree nearby. I looked again; it was a real-life giraffe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An assistant said Jackson would be ready soon, and I spent 20 minutes inspecting a wall full of Jackson photographs with Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis Presley and other celebrities.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finally, Michael was ready. I was introduced to him in an elaborate dining room and then followed him upstairs to the library, which featured a life-sized studio portrait of Walt Disney.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Do you mind if I record our talk?&quot; he asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Not if you don&#39;t use it commercially,&quot; I replied.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He started by asking a few questions and I explained how I approached an interview with Walt. When he ran out of queries, I provided some memories of Walt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Toward the end of the conversation, Michael hesitantly asked whether Walt ever used a certain expletive. Without thinking, I replied I had never heard him utter it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The interview was over and Michael escorted me to the photographs I had already perused.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was busy in the mid-1980s and I didn&#39;t expect to see him again. Yet a few months later he called. &quot;Hello Bob, this is Michael,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you think Hazel George is still alive?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said I didn&#39;t know but would find out. George was Disney&#39;s longtime nurse who also exchanged studio gossip with him. I found out that Hazel was retired yet still living near the Disney lot in Burbank.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;d love to talk to her,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;Can you arrange it?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did, and a few days later, Jackson picked me up at my house in his chauffeured limo and I directed the driver to Hazel&#39;s bungalow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hazel had aged since I interviewed her for the biography and I found that I would have to prompt her. I had recorded the stories she once gave me and had brought the tapes along, so I played them back and let her deliver the punchlines.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was fascinated but scarcely said a word. When we finished, Hazel said to Jackson, &quot;Come back and see me, and don&#39;t bring him.&quot; She meant me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few months passed and then another call: &quot;Hello Bob, this is Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He wanted to know more about Walt Disney and wanted me to join him at a San Fernando Valley recording studio. I arrived on time and waited an hour until he finished a session. We sat down in an office and he again asked questions about Walt, most of which he had asked in our first visit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also asked again whether Walt had ever used a certain expletive. This time I remembered that he had on at least one occasion and I proceeded to explain the humorous circumstance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I never saw Michael after that.</span></p></body>
