Hearing that, Debbie Rowe, a nurse working for Jackson&rsquo;s dermatologist, came forward with an unusual offer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">DEBBIE ROWE: I said, if you want to be a daddy, I want to do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1996, she became pregnant with Jackson&rsquo;s first child. &nbsp;It raised eyebrows across the world, in part because it didn&rsquo;t seem to be a romance. Even by the standards of what constituted typical behavior from the eccentric superstar, it was a surprise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">DEBBIE ROWE: I would never do this for money. I did this because I love him. That&rsquo;s the only reason I did this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later that year, they were married in Sydney, Australia. Katherine Jackson was not present. Three months later, Michael Jackson, Jr. &ndash; known as Prince &ndash; was born. Debbie talked about the new father.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">DEBBIE ROWE: He feeds him. He changes his diapers, he reads to him, he sings to him. If he&rsquo;s on the phone, the baby is in his arms. If he&rsquo;s having a meeting, the baby is there. He takes naps with him. He is there, I don&rsquo;t need to be there. I don&rsquo;t need to be there because Michael is. I&rsquo;d have nothing to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A daughter, Paris, was born in 1998. A third child, Prince Michael II, known as Blanket, was born later to a surrogate mother whose identity has never been revealed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe divorced in 1999, with Debbie giving up her parental rights in return for a cash settlement and a home in Beverly Hills.</span></p></body>
