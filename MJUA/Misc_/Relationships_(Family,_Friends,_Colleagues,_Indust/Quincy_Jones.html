He has to go and see some children at a hospital and someone says: &#39;There is an oxygen tent to sustain life.&#39; Knowing Michael, it&#39;s fascinating—and he wants to see it.

He is amazingly shy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What people forget about him is that for the first time, probably in the history of music, a black artist is embraced on a global level by everyone from eight to 80 years old. People all over the world, especially young people, have a black man as an idol.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough - BBC Radio 2 40th Birthday Special&rdquo; (August 29, 1998), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Maybe five or eight people have the touch that God put on Michael.

He&#39;s with us by phone. He&#39;s the legendary musical conductor, record producer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He produced three of Michael&#39;s solo albums &quot;Off the Wall,&quot; &quot;Thriller,&quot; and &quot;Bad.&quot; They also collaborated on the &quot;We Are the World&quot; charity project. He comes to us from Luxembourg.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&#39;s your reaction to all of this, Quincy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">QUINCY JONES, RECORD PRODUCER (via phone): It&#39;s almost surrealistic, Larry. I, you know, Ed McMahon and Farrah Fawcett and Michael in a day and a half, it&#39;s almost — I just couldn&#39;t believe it. And I heard about Michael. I mean, I almost collapsed, I&#39;m telling you because it&#39;s just — I was on the way to London to see him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All my friends had arrived. All of us were getting together. We are going to be together tomorrow. And I just — I just can&#39;t believe it, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What was he like to work with?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JONES: The most professional person I&#39;ve ever worked with in my life. I saw that when we started &quot;The Wiz,&quot; he asked me to help him find a producer for his solo album on Epic. I said, Michael, we have to get a song for you in &quot;The Wiz&quot; first. Listen and pre-record. We&#39;ll talk about that later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I watched him and saw how aware and focused he was. He knew everybody&#39;s lyrics, everybody&#39;s dance steps, everybody&#39;s dialogue. And I saw something in him I&#39;d never seen before because I had worked with him. And he went out — when he was rehearsing with the group, he — he announced — I was shocked. He said &ldquo;so-cray-tees&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said Michael, Socrates. And he said really? And he looked at me like a deer in the headlights. I said, I&#39;d like to take a shot at producing your album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Why he was...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JONES: He says you&#39;re too jazzy, Quincy can&#39;t do it. You know? And Michael came back crying. And he (INAUDIBLE) and we went back and we did it. I said, Michael, don&#39;t you worry about a thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You know Miko pretty well, too, don&#39;t you, Quincy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(CROSSTALK)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You know Miko well, too?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JONES: Miko is my baby brother. And his father was my brother, too. Since 1951.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Was Michael a perfectionist?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JONES: Absolutely. And so was I. So together we were dangerous, man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(LAUGHTER)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was — because, you know, the relationship between an artist, Larry, and a producer, is the most intimate relationship you can imagine. It takes love first, you know, to understand the limits and all — when it&#39;s too pushing it too hard or when it&#39;s time to cool it or you go for another take.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You had to be very sensitive. And it takes love to have that kind of observation. But Michael was one of the hardest workers and focused and professional. You know, we were doing the &quot;ET&quot; album the same time we were doing &quot;Thriller&quot; for Steven Spielberg.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we did it all real quick. You know I&#39;m telling you. We had three studios going on. (INAUDIBLE) Michael on another with long tubes singing. It&#39;s just amazing memories. And my mind has been cascading memories down all night long.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...KING: Quincy, before you leave us, when working with him — we&#39;ve heard so many stories, mixed, pro and con. Was he difficult to work with, Quincy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JONES: Michael difficult? Michael&#39;s the most professional person I ever worked with in my life, ever, in every way. In fact, we used to set up a stand when he sang. He&#39;d do his dances and just have a spotlight on the stand, a pin spot on the stand and he&#39;d do his dances and do his twists and everything else while he was singing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was absolutely amazing and I just send my heart out to his children and his mother and father and his family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Thank you, Quincy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JONES: He&#39;s my blue brother, and our souls were attached for a long time, very deeply. And it was love and trust and passion and I&#39;ll treasure that as long as I live.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/michael-jackson-s-studio-men-lift-the-king-of-pop-s-mask-1.608702"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The National&rdquo; (Abu Dhabi) (September 25, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200225232143/https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/michael-jackson-s-studio-men-lift-the-king-of-pop-s-mask-1.608702"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There was no one like him,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;He focused on everything he did and he would never give up.

He was a good-looking, but very shy, young man who hid his remarkable intelligence behind his soft voice and smiles. But don&rsquo;t let the appearance fool you, there was, behind it, an artist who was a perfectionist to the extreme and consumed by the ambition of becoming the greatest showman in the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s first recollection of meeting Quincy Jones was at a Muhammad Ali Benefit show. However, the most common story is he first met Quincy Jones at Sammy Davies&rsquo;s house in 1972, where he was holding a party. Sammy told Quincy that evening that Michael was a special talent and was going to be a huge star. Little then, would he know, that he would be part of the biggest selling album of all time a decade later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The pair&rsquo;s first collaboration came in 1978 for The Wiz. Quincy almost didn&rsquo;t do the film, only agreeing as a repaid favour for Sidney Lumet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael originally didn&rsquo;t have a number in the Wiz so Quincy put the idea to Lumet who happily agreed.</span></p></body>
