He had his personal chef Akasha Richmond to whip up his favorites: Spicy enchiladas, fresh tortillas and matzo ball soup.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the mid-90&rsquo;s MJ was living in the penthouse of the Manhattan Trump tower, sharing a floor with Donald Trump. He was in town finishing up his epic HIStory album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richmond was living a few blocks south at what was then the glamorous Helmsley Palace (now the New York Palace), often picking up bagels on her short walk up to Jackson&rsquo;s apartment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ with Akasha Richmond and her daughter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;One day Michael asked for lox and bagel for breakfast,&rdquo; Richmond told me. She was a bit surprised by the request but went with it. A few days later, he asked her to make matzo ball soup.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What do you know from matzo ball soup?&rdquo; Richmond recalls retorting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I grew up with a Jewish nanny. I love matzo ball soup,&rdquo; Jackson replied.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richmond met Jackson back in the 1980&rsquo;s when she was cooking at The Golden Temple, one of L.A.&rsquo;s first vegetarian spots known for playing host to celebrities like Bob Dylan and Demi Moore. &ldquo;He used to come there everyday. He was really sweet and I used to take care of him,&rdquo; Richmond recalls.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Soon she and another chef from The Golden Temple started cooking at Jackson&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;He would have these epic dinner parties. He loved old Hollywood so Elizabeth Taylor, Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren might be there. You never knew who would come over,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Over the next 14 years Richmond traveled with Jackson on his private plane to 30 countries, cooking for him on his HIStory and Bad tours. The crew built her a six foot portable pantry stocked with his favorites &mdash; ingredients for Mexican food and matzo meal. &ldquo;I think for him [matzo ball soup] was comfort food,&rdquo; she explained.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richmond never had a family matzo ball recipe so &ldquo;I would make chicken stock and then follow the recipe on the package&hellip;and add a good pinch of cayenne pepper or minced jalape&ntilde;o &mdash; he loved spicy food,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I used to joke that I was Michael&rsquo;s Jewish mother. I was supposed to keep him healthy. When your on those tours it&rsquo;s really grueling. I did whatever it took: matzo ball soup, green juice, chai tea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A decade or so later, Richmond left the tour life to spend more time with her daughter, but on the weekends she would trek out to Neverland Ranch to cook for Jackson. &ldquo;My daughter had her bat mitzvah party on the ranch&hellip;It was about the best bat mitzvah you could have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Akasha Richmond, personal chef for Bad Tour and HIStory Tour, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://issuu.com/la_wattstimes/docs/lawt-6-24-10"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;L.A.

We were both shy. He came in everyday. What I&rsquo;ll miss most is the laugh, the love and fun that I have never seen since.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span><img src="Akasha%20Richmond%20(chef)_files/image0.jpg" width="299" height="427" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p></body>
