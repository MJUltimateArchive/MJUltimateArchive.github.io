We just reminisced about some of the things we had done. &nbsp;His son was about a year or so old and adorable, fascinated with my height and hair. &nbsp;Michael was discussing a video he was doing with Vince Paterson directing. &nbsp;I suggested Conrad Hall shooting it since Conrad did such a terrific job on Dirty Diana. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That was the last time I saw him. &nbsp;All hell broke loose and he became reclusive. &nbsp;Sad.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://pytka.com/stories/thief-of-bagdad"><span class="cs8567212B">Personal website (accessed April 8, 2020)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200408215542/http://pytka.com/stories/thief-of-bagdad"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After we did THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL, Michael and I discussed doing WEST SIDE STORY. I contacted the owners of the material and they weren&rsquo;t interested saying that the property was continuously profitable and didn&rsquo;t want the original Jerome Robbins choreography tampered with, and that was that. I felt that THE WAY&hellip; could easily extended into a original musical and Michael (and Frank DiLeo) agreed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SONY and Michael, however, began to develop a similar script called MIDKNIGHT, and urban musical to be directed by Anton Furst who was the Production Designer on FULL METAL JACKET and BATMAN. &nbsp;As far as I knew, it was a done deal with a finished script so my idea was toast. I loved the idea but since Michael was committed to MIDKNIGHT&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tragedy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anton Furst committed suicide. &nbsp;The story was that he was depressed ever since working with Kubrick on FULL METAL JACKET. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You can&rsquo;t make this up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and I once discussed films we liked and Korda&rsquo;s THIEF OF BAGDAD was a film we both loved.. &nbsp;I discussed a version with Frank and he said that the last thing he wanted to see was Michael on a magic carpet. Point taken, but that wasn&rsquo;t what I had in mind. &nbsp;I envisioned a world where Leonardo&rsquo;s inventions had come to life. &nbsp;Jim Lima and I worked on the idea and he created a number of stunning concept boards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They were liked, if not loved. &nbsp;Michael later took one of the ideas to do the song SCREAM. &nbsp;We were to do the video based on the concept boards but Janet wanted to do another idea, so&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back to THE THIEF.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and Frank had split and when some of the scandal smoke had cleared, I was asked to do a video for HEAL THE WORLD. &nbsp;In a meeting I mentioned the THIEF project and Sandy Gallin, Michael&rsquo;s new agent, suggested I take it directly to SONY where they owed Michael a movie, so I took it to SONY where they owed Michael a movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Disaster.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The orderly that I met asked what the budget would be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">$125,000,000.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We&rsquo;re not prepared to spend that much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How much are you prepare to spend?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ten to fifteen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spent seventeen on his video SMOOTH CRIMINAL.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(embarrassed look)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Are you qualified to greenlight this movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Why am I here?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It turns out that SONY was full of shit about the promise to have Michael make a film. &nbsp;Michael&rsquo;s videos were all hits. &nbsp;People still love them. &nbsp;Many told stories. &nbsp;THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL was a number one. &nbsp;Michael proved his acting chops in the prequil and the dance. &nbsp;Steven Spielberg felt it was the best dance film since SINGIN&rsquo; IN THE RAIN. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; that THIEF would have been great but we&rsquo;ll never see Michael in a long form and it was something he wanted to do and he proved it many times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Our loss.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://pytka.com/stories/frank-dileo"><span class="cs8567212B">Personal website (accessed April 8, 2020)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200409010815/http://pytka.com/stories/frank-dileo"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">FRANK DILEO was Michael Jackson&rsquo;s agent, manager, handler, whatever. &nbsp;Brilliant. &nbsp;I met him while I was doing a series of Pepsi commercials with Michael tied into the BAD album. &nbsp;The creatives for Pepsi had done some cheesy storyboards and our initial meeting with MJ didn&rsquo;t go well despite the agency trying to explain the stuff. &nbsp;Frank found out we were both from Pittsburgh and there is a bond among us out there. &nbsp;He pulled me aside and asked me if &nbsp;&nbsp;I could help since the agency, for some strange reason, didn&rsquo;t want to spend money for better boards, so I had some very large boards done and set up another meeting. &nbsp;Michael walked through the boards and asked whether we could actually do the stuff indicated on the boards and I assured him that we could. &nbsp;Money well spent. &nbsp;Frank was off to the side and winked. &nbsp;We were friends from then on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael liked what I had done in the commercials and Frank asked me to do the music video (Michael liked to call them &lsquo;short films&rsquo;) for MAN IN THE MIRROR, and I started to work on some ideas. &nbsp;A while later Frank told me that they didn&rsquo;t need a video for that song since it was a slam dunk number one without a video and he sent me the demo for THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL. &nbsp;The purpose was to have more Number Ones than any other albums and Frank&rsquo;s (and Quincy Jones&rsquo;) vision and perception were brilliant. &nbsp;Frank&rsquo;s notion was that I CAN&rsquo;T STOP LOVING YOU would be the first release and would be an instant Number One since Michael hadn&rsquo;t released an album for a number of years. &nbsp;BAD would be an easy Number One with MAN IN THE MIRROR another. &nbsp;The other songs would need some help to position them. &nbsp;I was troubled and disappointed after he pulled MAN IN THE MIRROR since THE WAY&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t as strong a piece of music and I had trouble understanding it. A similar thing happened to me years later when Yoko pulled WORKING CLASS HERO and replaced it with STARTING OVER but that&rsquo;s another story. THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL sounded soft to me and there was no thread in the piece to give a hint for a video treatment. &nbsp;Frank and Quincy told me what the purpose was. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t remember who said it but the phrase, &ldquo;&hellip;the purpose of the video was to get Michael some pussy!&rdquo; &nbsp;The result &mdash; another Number One. I don&rsquo;t know if Michael got laid.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Frank and I became good friends after work on the commercials and the videos and we worked on a terrific film idea for Michael but after the final BAD tour, Michael and Frank split. Later, I took the treatment to SONY but they didn&rsquo;t want to spend the money that the film would take. &nbsp;The SONY executive mentioned a budget and I told him that SMOOTH CRIMINAL cost more than that. &nbsp;I never knew the reason that Michael and Frank split, because Frank disappeared for a while. &nbsp;A long time passed and I helped Frank a bit through a bad time he was having and he finally reunited with Michael, ironically to put together the tribute film after Michael&rsquo;s passing. &nbsp;We had a great lunch together to reminisce a bit about the days with Michael. &nbsp;Frank looked great and was his old self, but he, too, passed soon after that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Frank was one of the most vivid characters I ever met and was decent, honest, and perceptive. That honesty was a rare thing in that business. &nbsp;If he and Michael had stayed together, Michael&rsquo;s history would certainly have changed and for the better. &nbsp;I think of Frank often. &nbsp;It was a great time.</span></p></body>
