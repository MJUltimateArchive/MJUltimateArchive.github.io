I&#39;ve read Bullshit about Taryll being jealous that he never worked with his uncle, HE WAS A KID!!!! who spent most of his life with his uncle while developing his own kraft. Finally once he&#39;s ready as a producer such a tragedy strikes! Or the stupid bastard that made the statement about him being jealous, I want you to know that Michael loved him and his brothers very very much!! And would have done anything for them so stop trying to put shit in the game!!!!! The song has been reworked by taryll and myself and it&#39;s amazing!! I just never mentioned it because I don&#39;t ever want people to think I am trying to promote myself or my music, my work speaks for itself:0)</span></p></body>
