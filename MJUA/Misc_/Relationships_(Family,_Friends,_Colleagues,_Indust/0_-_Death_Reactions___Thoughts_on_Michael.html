He was always very fragile, had lots of trouble sleeping. He reminded me a lot of Don McLean&#39;s song about Vincent Van Gogh. The world can be mean, and Michael didn&#39;t have a mean bone in him. Very vulnerable and sweet. And what most people don&#39;t realize is how smart he was and especially how funny he could be. A very witty, explosively talented guy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Movieline: Where were you when you heard he&#39;d died? What did you immediately think and feel?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mick Garris: I was driving in my car when I heard on the radio that he&#39;d been found unconscious and had been rushed to the hospital. I was stunned, of course, like everyone. Then, about an hour or so later, when I heard it rumored that he had died, I just couldn&#39;t believe it. It took a couple of days for it to sink in. Maybe it was inevitable, I don&#39;t know. I just know that he was fragile, sensitive, and an incredibly sweet and generous guy. It broke my heart, just like it broke the world&#39;s. And I really felt for his kids, who are terrific and unspoiled in a way you wouldn&#39;t imagine. At least, they were when I last saw them a couple of years ago.</span></p></body>
