He was the best cook ever,&quot; Paris told Winfrey. &quot;He was just a normal dad.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He made the best French toast in the world,&quot; she added. &quot;He just made the best breakfasts in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Prince and Paris described Michael as &quot;strict&quot; but said he often treated them to sweets like Snickers candy bars and Coca-Cola.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He tried to raise us without us knowing who he was, but that didn&#39;t really go so well,&quot; Paris said, smiling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two shared their favorite memories of Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were in Bahrain, and we used to wake up early and walk on the beach,&quot; Prince said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One time we were on the roof of the Luxor in Las Vegas, just saw all the city lights,&quot; Paris said. &quot;We were eating Snickers, we had some soda.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Sometimes he would take me to a museum, because we both loved art,&quot; Paris added. &quot;We&#39;d play tag outside. He got us Kenya [their dog] four years ago.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Blanket, 8, barely spoke during the interview, answering &quot;yes&quot; when Winfrey asked if he was still home-schooled.

Yeah, he did (want us to have a normal life). He had his doubts, &lsquo;cause I remember he told us that when he was younger, he never &ndash; he didn&rsquo;t really have a childhood, like, he would always be stuck in the studio singing while other kids were out playing, and he wanted us to have that. So we would, a lot of times, go to Chuck E. Cheese and everything, and that was &ndash; Chuck E. Cheese and Toys R Us was one of our favourite places to go.</span></p></body>
