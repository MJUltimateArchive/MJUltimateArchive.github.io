As he tells MTV in a recent interview, the only reason &ldquo;Hold My Hand&rdquo; is featured on </span><span class="cs43C038A">Michael</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> is that it&rsquo;s actually a finished track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hold My Hand&rsquo; was one of the records that was actually fully complete,&rdquo; Akon says. &ldquo;The rest of the ideas aren&rsquo;t fully complete. They&rsquo;re just ideas, concepts, and harmonies which the world will probably never see, because I would never put it out unfinished. So I might just burn it after this interview&hellip; We&rsquo;ve done plenty of records outside of this. But they were just incomplete.&rdquo; &lsquo;Kon&rsquo;s sentiment is similar is the Black Eyed Peas&rsquo; Will.i.am, who refuses to release any of the work he and Jackson did during the latter years of his life.</span></p></body>
