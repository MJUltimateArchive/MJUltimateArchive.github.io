And he was a very imposing figure. And I was so happy to be at Motown and I was asked to come to see this group at Bobby Taylor&#39;s apartment. We lived in the same apartment building.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I walked in and I saw these kids. And they were unbelievable. And I called Mr. Gordy and I said, oh, I&#39;ve just seen the most fantastic act. And he said, great. And I said, yes, these kids. He said, kids? I don&#39;t want any kids. Stevie Wonder is enough of a handful. Go find some talented adults basically.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And, you know, I was terribly new and terribly green. And I didn&#39;t know what to do. And I just had been so profoundly affected by their talent that I went back one more time, mustered up all my courage. And I said, Mr. Gordy, you just have to see these kids. And he finally relented and he agreed to audition them. And the rest is history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Suzanne, did you [know he was going to be a hit]?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">DE PASSE: Absolutely. And as much as one can know anything in this business, I think that he had the charisma, the talent, the voice, the everything you take. When you think about the it factor is, that&#39;s what he had at that age. He was phenomenal. And then when he wasn&#39;t performing, he was, like, this regular kid that was wanting to color and get candy and mess around. You know? It was just an amazing combination of elements.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Did Berry recognize it as soon as he saw him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">DE PASSE: Oh, yes. That&#39;s one of the things that gave me job security for many, many years at Motown is that&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Laughter]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">DE PASSE: You know, I had—I had to talk him into it. And I think that—yes, but, of all the people in the world who recognized his talent, Berry Gordy was, you know—I mean what he mobilized from the time he saw Michael, I mean, and the group was signed and Michael and the Jackson 5 had three number one records in a row before they ever went out to perform.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I had the opportunity to take them out on their first tour and clearly didn&#39;t know what I was doing. But we all figured it out together and, I mean, it was so incredible to see what young kids, in particular, young African-American kids, how they embraced the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And, I mean, we went from being completely anonymous—I should say the boys went from being completely anonymous to being absolutely on lockdown not able to go anywhere in a period of a few months. It was phenomenal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://blogs.reuters.com/world-wrap/2009/06/26/michael-jackson-becomes-motowns-latest-fallen-hero/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Reuters&rdquo; (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190628022702/http://blogs.reuters.com/world-wrap/2009/06/26/michael-jackson-becomes-motowns-latest-fallen-hero/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson rose to fame as the youngest member of the Jackson 5, a group that Motown founder Berry Gordy was initially reluctant to sign. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t want any more kid acts because Stevie Wonder was more than a handful,&rdquo; said former Motown executive Suzanne de Passe, who lobbied Gordy to sign them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">De Passe toured extensively with the Jackson 5, taking charge of their costumes, schooling, choreography and concert production. &ldquo;Michael was very mischievous back in those days,&rdquo; de Passe said, recalling that he loved to hide in closets and behind doors to scare unsuspecting targets. She dubbed him &ldquo;Casper,&rdquo; and when she saw him decades later mobbed by fans, she yelled out &ldquo;Casper!&rdquo; and Jackson immediately rushed over to give her a hug.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson left Motown for the greener pastures of Epic Records in 1979, and de Passe said she last spoke to him about three years ago. She was on a retreat when she heard of Jackson&rsquo;s death, and described the news as &ldquo;the shock of my life.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
