Everything that&#39;s going on is an unfortunate situation for everyone involved, and you know...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: When did you first get to meet him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: I first meet him — kind of called me randomly out of the blue, hi, it&#39;s Michael. It&#39;s like hey. And the thing is...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: This after &quot;Home Alone.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: This is after &quot;Home Alone.&quot; I had actually met him before I was doing &quot;Nutcracker&quot; at Lincoln Center. I was playing Fritz, and he came back stage one day. And I actually met him very briefly and he kind of recognized me because it was after I had done &quot;Uncle Buck.&quot; And so, he kind of mentions something. Than he calls me up kind of out of the blue and it&#39;s just this weird, random kind of thing. Why don&#39;t you come over to my house?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Think is, I didn&#39;t react to him the way most people did. Most people are like Michael Jackson, and you know, he was a god to people. And to me, I knew he was a pop singer but beyond that, I wasn&#39;t one of the fans. I think that&#39;s one of the reasons why we connected was the fact that — believe me, I call him a jerk all the time. I call him a fat head and this and that and he gets it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: And brother (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: Yes. We all did. He was a family friend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What happened at the house? That&#39;s what all the things that people are concerned about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: That&#39;s what&#39;s so weird.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What did happen?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: Nothing happened. You know, nothing really. I mean, we played video games. We, you know, played at his amusement park.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Did he sleep in the bed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: The thing is with that whole thing, oh, you slept in the same bedroom as him. It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t think you understand, Michael Jackson&#39;s bedroom is two stories and it has like three bathrooms and this and that. So, when I slept in his bedroom, yes, but you understand the whole scenario. And the thing is with Michael he&#39;s not good as explaining himself and he never really has been, because he&#39;s not a very social person. You&#39;re talking about someone who has been sheltered and sheltering himself also for the last like 30 years. And so, he&#39;s not very good at communicating to people and not good at conveying what he&#39;s actually trying to say to you. So, when he says something like that people — he doesn&#39;t quite understand why people react the way that they do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Why do you think he likes young people so much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: Because the same reason why he liked me, was the fact that I didn&#39;t care who he was. That was the thing. I talked to him like he was a normal human being and kids do that to him because he&#39;s Michael Jackson the pop singer, but he&#39;s not the God, the &quot;king of pop&quot; or anything like that. He&#39;s just a guy who is actually very kid-like himself and wants to go out there and wants to play video games with you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Did your parents encourage it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: They weren&#39;t against it. It wasn&#39;t like they encouraged it or pushing me upon it. I wanted to hang out with him and they were fine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What do you make of what he&#39;s going through now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: Like I said, it&#39;s unfortunate, and you know, it&#39;s a circus.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Do you think it&#39;s a bad rap?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: You know, I think so. Yes. Listen, look what happened the first time this happened to him. If someone had done something like that to my kid, I wouldn&#39;t settle for some money. I&#39;d make sure the guy was in jail. It just really goes to show as soon as they got the money and they ran. I mean, that&#39;s what really what happened the first time. And so I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s a little crazy and I kind of have taken a step back from the whole thing, because it is a bit of a circus. And you know, if the same thing was happening to me, I wouldn&#39;t want to drag him into it and vice versa. So I try my best to take a distance from it, but like I said he was still a friend of mine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: If they asked you to be a character witness, would you appear?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: I guess so, but probably not. Like I said, it&#39;s crazy, and I don&#39;t really want to be a part of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You like him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: I like him and he&#39;s a friend of mine. I&#39;m not saying I wouldn&#39;t. It hasn&#39;t been brought up to me and I don&#39;t think he&#39;d want me to either. Just because, like I said, if the same thing was happening to me...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What reaction has happened to you from all of this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: What do you mean?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Do people inquire of you a lot about it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: Sometimes. You know, people always have their opinions. It&#39;s funny. People always talk to me about him, because you know, I&#39;m one of these people who will tell you anything about my life, really, to get me going. You know, so yes, I mean, I&#39;ve openly and freely talked about him and stuff like that. But overall, you know, he&rsquo;s just a good friend of mine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You wish him well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CULKIN: Of course I do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/reviews/16211/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;New York&rdquo; (March 1, 2006)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191213231621/http://nymag.com/arts/books/reviews/16211/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;[My novel &lsquo;Junior&rsquo;] is not a sensational book. There&rsquo;s no Michael Jackson references at all, so get that out of your head right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&rsquo;s easier said than done, given that it was less than a year ago that Culkin testified for the defense during the pop star&rsquo;s molestation trial. &ldquo;You know, I didn&rsquo;t want to get involved with the whole thing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was a big, fat mess. I almost wanted to say to him, &lsquo;You should have known better, just to even have those kind of people in your life.&rsquo; &rdquo; He thinks for a moment and continues. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it happened, but somehow I&rsquo;ve become the resident Michael Jackson expert. We&rsquo;re close, he&rsquo;s a good friend of mine, we definitely have a connection that most people don&rsquo;t have, but he&rsquo;s a friend that I talk to once a year.&rdquo; When they talk, Culkin always encourages Jackson to get back to music. &ldquo;You know, call up the Roots, call up the Beastie Boys, call up Bj&ouml;rk.&rdquo; The last time they spoke was a few months after the trial: &ldquo;He sounded better &hellip;&rdquo; He trails off, distracted. &ldquo;One of the things that I always thought is that I could have turned out that way. I&rsquo;m a fairly sheltered person, but I could have just put up a fortress around myself, bought a big chunk of land somewhere, and said, &lsquo;Fuck all y&rsquo;all!&rsquo; But I made a decision when I was 14 that I was going to live life, where I think he made the opposite decision. It&rsquo;s a cool little world that he has, but at the same time, it&rsquo;s become a little more distant from reality.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
