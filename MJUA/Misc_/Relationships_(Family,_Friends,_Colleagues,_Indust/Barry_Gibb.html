Is that how it was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Maurice, MJ, Barry &amp; Robin &ndash; circa 1985.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BG: Well not always, but most of the time he stayed at my home when he came to Miami. And most of the time he would have a hotel room, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be there. So everyone thought he would be there and he&rsquo;d be at my place and we&rsquo;d have the most fun. And the fun that he had, the Michael I saw was happy, cheerful&hellip; I never saw a dark side of Michael. I never saw an unhappy Michael. He&rsquo;d swim with the kids, he&rsquo;d go water-skiing and it was all a very, very natural situation. Just a natural situation and he&rsquo;d have a great time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TR: I&rsquo;ve been listening to some of his songs again, songs like Stranger In Moscow, incredible songs and you realise there&rsquo;s a synergy between the Gibbs and what he was doing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BG: Well he has said so and songs like Love You Inside Out in particular struck him as him, saying that that&rsquo;s what he wanted to do. The Spirits Having Flown album, yeah&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/barry-gibb-the-last-brother-236995/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rolling Stone&rdquo; (July 4, 2014)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200218222646/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/barry-gibb-the-last-brother-236995/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He would come to Miami and stay in our house,&rdquo; says Gibb. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d sit in the kitchen and watch the fans outside his hotel on TV, just giggling &ndash; &lsquo;Hee hee!&#39;&rdquo; He lived upstairs for a while, right before his child-molestation trial. &ldquo;We never discussed the case,&rdquo; says Gibb. &ldquo;We would just sit around and write and get drunk.
