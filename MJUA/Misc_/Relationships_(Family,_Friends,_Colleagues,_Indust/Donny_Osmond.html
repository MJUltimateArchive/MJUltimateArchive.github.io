Close friends throughout their iconic careers, Michael Jackson and Donny Osmond stayed in touch by telephone over the years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We met when we were about 13,&quot; Osmond recalled Friday, a few hours before taking the stage for the Donny &amp; Marie Show at the Flamingo Las Vegas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The teen idols bonded over an uncanny number of coincidences: Both were members of famous musical families before they reached their teen years. Both were from families with nine children. Both were the seventh child.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Our mothers were even born on the same day,&quot; said Osmond, &quot;and our fathers were both extreme disciplinarians, although my father was not a Joe Jackson.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At 14, Jackson had his first No. 1, &quot;Ben,&quot; in 1972. It was written for Osmond, but he was later told they couldn&rsquo;t reach him because he was touring.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That made &rsquo;em even. &quot;One Bad Apple,&quot; The Osmond family&rsquo;s&rsquo; No. 1 hit in 1971 (when Donny was 14) &quot;was written for Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The similarities continued. Donny and Marie had a TV show. So did Michael and Janet, briefly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael said he hated every second of it,&quot; said Osmond.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was living in Las Vegas when they last talked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During that last conversation, Osmond remembers asking Jackson, &quot;Where are you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&quot; said Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You can&rsquo;t tell me?&quot; said Osmond, gently chiding his longtime friend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Please don&rsquo;t tell anyone,&quot; said Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I rented a motor home and I&rsquo;m down in Arizona. I just want to hide. I want to get away from people,&quot; said Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Osmond invited him to drive up to Utah. Jackson said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you up on that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But that was it. &quot;He shut it down after that,&quot; said Osmond. &quot;He isolated himself after that. His life was in shambles,&quot; from financial setbacks and scandal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, 50, died of cardiac arrest Thursday at home in the Holmby Hills area of Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&rsquo;s been a tough day,&quot; Osmond said Friday. It was audible in his voice. In a matter of days, three show business people he knew had died. Ed McMahon, Farrah Fawcett and Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He recalled another telephone call, maybe three or four years ago. This one came from Stevie Wonder, who invited Osmond over to his recording studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When he got there, they chatted, and Wonder cut to the chase.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What I really wanted you here for is to get closer to Michael because he really needs some help,&quot; Wonder told him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Osmond did a cover of Wonder&rsquo;s 1976 No. 1 hit &quot;I Wish&quot; and took it to Jackson&rsquo;s Neverland Ranch to play it for him. That was the kind of friendship they had.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Jackson&rsquo;s megahit &quot;Thriller&quot; came out in 1984, &quot;I went to see him to see if he could help me get my career back on track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I asked him, &lsquo;How do I get back on the charts?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Change your image,&quot; said Jackson, &quot;and your name.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Donny Osmond later releases &ldquo;Soldier of Love&rdquo; anonymously with great success.]</span></p></body>
