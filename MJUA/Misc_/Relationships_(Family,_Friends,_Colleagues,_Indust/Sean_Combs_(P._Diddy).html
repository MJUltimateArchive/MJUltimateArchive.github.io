Daddy [SIC] Combs. How are you handling this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SEAN &quot;P. DIDDY&quot; COMBS, RECORD PRODUCER (via phone): You know, my heart is just hurting. It&#39;s hard to explain the words. When I first heard the news, you know, I was just shocked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And as you just watch -- you watch television and you see all the old videos, this man was the greatest recording artist of our time. This man, through his music actually, like, made a change in the world. He was the only artist that you could say people knew of this man in every country, no matter his song was in English. But no matter who country it was in, everybody knew the words to his song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And you know, when I heard the coverage today, and I hear everybody talking about the controversy and the downs, everybody has downs in their life. This man had so much positivity and so much of a positive effect, especially on my generation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You know, I didn&#39;t grow up listening to Elvis of the Beatles. This guy was like my hero. And he gave birth to all the artists in my generation. And I just think it&#39;s so sad to watch everybody talk about things that weren&#39;t proven. And I think it&#39;s important that we give him his day, man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He changed the world. Like, he made me believe in magic. He made me -- he made me actually visualize the music. He made me want to make music. And I just think it&#39;s important for all the artists out there to call in and for us to be heard and let the people know how much this man meant to us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/music-world-mourns-michael-jacksons-death-64237/"><span class="cs8567212B">Twitter (June 25, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson showed me that you can actually see the beat.
