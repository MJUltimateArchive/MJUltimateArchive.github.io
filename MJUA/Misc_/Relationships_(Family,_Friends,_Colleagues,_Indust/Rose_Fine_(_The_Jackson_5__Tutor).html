It was Rose who instilled in me a love of books and literature that sustains me today. I read everything I could get my hands on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rabbi Smuley interview (August - December 2000), from &ldquo;The Micheal Jackson Tapes&rdquo; (October 2010)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rose died this year. Janet and myself, we paid for her nurse and her hospital care, or if her television broke down or the electricity, or there was anything wrong with the house, we would cover the bills. Now her husband is sick, so I am taking care of him and because we felt she is our mother and you take care of your mother&hellip; She was more than a tutor and I was so angry at myself that when she died I was far, far away. I couldn&rsquo;t get there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rose Fine, &quot;The Jackson 5&quot; tutor, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking in 1970s, Rose spoke of her work with the Jackson 5:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We always work on a schedule, although sometimes, I give them a bit of a holiday, like I did when we were in Australia. Usually I have everything worked out and I know the schedule weeks in hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rose only worked with the family when they were on tour. The teaching Rose did was basically the same on the same subjects they did when at school, followed by their homework, to see what they had learned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The boys are very good during their sessions with me. They know what they have to do because eventually they have to go back to school, and they&rsquo;d feel out of place if they didn&rsquo;t match up to the rest of their class.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael and his brothers joined Motown in 1969, they were assigned Jewish teacher Rose Fine as their tutor, to accompany them on their tours. Rose had worked with the children from Mary Poppins and Walt Disney&rsquo;s Mousekateers. She also worked with Ron Howard, Annette Funicello, Bill Mumy, Jodie Foster and the Lennon Sisters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By law, the boys had to comply with the Educational Board of California&rsquo;s requirements of at least three hours tutoring a day, otherwise it was in Rose Fine&rsquo;s rights to cancel the concert.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was Rose&rsquo;s job to keep the boys grades up to standard, with three or four hours of tuition almost every day while they were on the road. Rose also took the opportunity to educate them with sightseeing tours in the different cities and countries they visited. She also encouraged them to read up on the different cultures of the countries, too, which particularly interested Michael and would be something he&rsquo;d continue through on various other subjects he was keen to learn about. He was a frequent visitor to museums and galleries all over the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Rose only worked with the family when they were on tour. The teaching Rose did was basically the same on the same subjects they did when at school, followed by their homework, to see what they had learned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Rose, who was married to Sidney Fine, passed away at her Studio City, California home on 5th June, 2000. She was 94 years old.</span></p></body>
