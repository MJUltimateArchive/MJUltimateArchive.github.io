But it was far from it. According to close associates Brando thought a lot of Michael, enough to give him lessons on acting. In the book &lsquo;Brando The Biography&rsquo; the author Peter Manso talks of Brando teaching Michael to seek the &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; when acting and to not let instinct get in the way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando taped a lot of the lessons according to Manso, even including a poem, &lsquo;Marlon Brando to Michael Jackson&rsquo; primarily written to get Michael to feel what he was reading in an emotional way. The poem was said to end with &ldquo;Brando Told You&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando met Michael through Quincy Jones, and his son Miko would later be his bodyguard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also appeared at the 30th anniversary tribute in September, 2001 taking the stage with a message of what happening to children in the world as he was addressing the audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Shortly before he died, Brando offered Michael a safe haven from the media at his pacific Island.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The New York Daily News obtained a deed that stated Michael was given a half-acre on the islet of Onetahi, in the French Polynesian atoll of Tetiaroa.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before this Michael had hosted a party for Brando&rsquo;s daughter Nina and was said to have been touched by the invitation. Writing to Michael he said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I can&#39;t easily describe the pleasure that has come our way with your invitation to Neverland. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(The island is) in consideration of gratitude and affection.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Love Dad.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-08-28/marlon-brando-confronted-michael-jackson-about-sexuality-podcast"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (August 29, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190918021940/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-08-28/marlon-brando-confronted-michael-jackson-about-sexuality-podcast"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From the sworn transcript [dated March 14, 1994]... Brando, who died in 2004, told prosecutors about confronting Jackson during a dinner visit to Neverland Ranch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We were talking about human emotions and where it all comes from. I could see from the way he behaved &mdash; he talked like that, and he speaks in a very peculiar way for a man who is as old as my oldest son, 35. And he didn&rsquo;t want me to swear,&rdquo; the actor said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I had asked him if he was a virgin and he sort of laughed and giggled, and he called me Brando,&rdquo; the actor added. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Oh, Brando.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Well, what do you do for sex?&rsquo; And he was acting fussy and embarrassed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando said he had asked Jackson if he masturbated, then told prosecutors that the singer &ldquo;lives in a completely different world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &ldquo;A Streetcar Named Desire&rdquo; star also talked with Jackson about what motivates people. Jackson &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t hold real emotions,&rdquo; Brando said, and that affected his ability to act.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He said he hated his father and started to cry. So I pulled back. I started to tiptoe. I realized that he was in trouble with his life because he was living in a never-never land, and he couldn&rsquo;t [swear], and for a 35-year-old man not to do that, being around people in show business, seemed very odd,&rdquo; Brando said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;Well, who are your friends?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody my own age. I don&rsquo;t like anybody my own age.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; He was crying hard enough that ... I tried to assuage him.
