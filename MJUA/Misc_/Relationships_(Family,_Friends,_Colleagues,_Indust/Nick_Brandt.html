He also gave me all his confidence. Working with him could also be very difficult for two reasons. Just because of this lighting history. It made me crazy that he insisted on always being over-exposed. And secondly, he always came late for the shoot, so I had not got enough time to shoot what was planned and it always ended up tearing my documents and improvising.</span></p></body>
