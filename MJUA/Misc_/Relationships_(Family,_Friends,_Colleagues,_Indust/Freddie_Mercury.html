Forum. I guess he liked us and he kept coming to see us and then we started talking and we used to go out and have dinners. Now, I think he just stays home and doesn&rsquo;t like coming out at all. At least that&rsquo;s what he says. He tells me whatever he wants, he can get at home. Anything he wants, he just buys it.&rdquo; I said I thought that kind of isolation was scary. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Freddie said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s not me. But that&rsquo;s his bag. I&rsquo;d be bored to death. I have to go out every night. I hate staying in one room for too long anyway, I just like to keep moving. Maybe it&rsquo;s because he started very young. I mean sometimes when I&rsquo;m talking to him I think, my god, he&rsquo;s only twenty-five and I&rsquo;m thirty-seven, but he&rsquo;s been in the business longer than I have, because he started so young. So, we can talk to each other on a very good parallel, because he has the same sort of experiences that I have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brian May, &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; lead guitarist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.express.co.uk/dayandnight/110639/Freddie-and-Jacko-s-secret-collaboration"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Express (June 29, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190827164029/https://www.express.co.uk/dayandnight/110639/Freddie-and-Jacko-s-secret-collaboration"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">May adds that Mercury couldn&rsquo;t resist poking light-hearted fun at the title of Jackson&rsquo;s then forthcoming album Bad back in 1987 after playing his Queen bandmates his recordings with the superstar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Amusingly, after Freddie and Michael had spent some time together recording, Freddie came back and played us the work in progress,&rdquo; May explains.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He remarked that Michael had come up with a great album title, Bad.
