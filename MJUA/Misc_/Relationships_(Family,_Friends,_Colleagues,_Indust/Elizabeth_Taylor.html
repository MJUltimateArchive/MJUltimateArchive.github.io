I&rsquo;m inspired by her bravery. She has been through so much and she is a survivor. That lady has been through a lot and she&rsquo;s walked out of it on two feet. I identify with her very strongly because of our experiences as child stars. When we first started talking on the phone, she told me she felt as if she had known me for years. I felt the same way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Elizabeth Taylor, ABC 2002 interview with Barbara Walters</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He has been hurt by so many people. I think I&rsquo;m the only person in his life that has not betrayed him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Elizabeth Taylor: My Love Affair with Jewelry&rdquo; autobiography (2002)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Over the years Michael has given me some truly incredible jewelry. Once he gave me a huge diamond ring and kept saying, &lsquo;Put it on, put it on. Look at the way it sparkles. I bet it&rsquo;s bigger than the Krupp.&rsquo; So I asked innocently, &lsquo;Really? How many carats is it, Michael?&rsquo; &lsquo;Seventeen,&rsquo; he answered. I embraced him and whispered in his ear, &lsquo;My honey darling, you missed.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another time we were at an auction together and I was getting excited about bidding on a pair of long shaggy Marina B diamond earrings, so I told him that he had to buy something, too. I showed him this delightful monkey necklace made up of diamonds, emeralds, and rubies with matching earrings. He probably thought I had something like &lsquo;auction fever&rsquo; when I pointed out that the two monkeys symbolized us, bonded in friendship. In hindsight, I must have made some sense, because these little monkeys are perfectly at home with all my other beloved jewelry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/liz-taylor-says-jackson-innocent-wbna3541350"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Today&rdquo; (November 23, 2003 statement)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190819205909/https://www.today.com/popculture/liz-taylor-says-jackson-innocent-wbna3541350"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I believe Michael is absolutely innocent and that he will be vindicated.

I love Michael with all my soul. I can&#39;t imagine life without him. We had so much in common. We had such loving fun together. I was packing up my clothes to go to London for his opening when I heard the news and I still can&#39;t believe it. I don&#39;t want to believe it. It can&#39;t be so.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He will live in my heart forever but it&#39;s not enough. My life feels so empty. I don&#39;t think anyone ever knew how much we loved each other. The purest, most giving love I&#39;ve ever known.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Oh, God, I&#39;m going to miss him. I can&#39;t yet imagine life without him. But I guess with God&#39;s help I&#39;ll learn. I keep looking at the photo he gave me of himself which says, &quot;To my true love Elizabeth, I love you forever.&rdquo; And I will love him forever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/26/jackson.taylor.tweets/index.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Personal &ldquo;Twitter&rdquo; (October 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226071649/http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/10/26/jackson.taylor.tweets/index.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was honored with the great privilege of seeing &#39;This Is It&#39; last week. I was sworn to secrecy, but now I can let you know about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It is the single most brilliant piece of filmmaking I have ever seen,&quot; Taylor tweeted. &quot;It cements forever Michael&#39;s genius in every aspect of creativity.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;To say the man is a genius is an understatement. He cradles each note, coaxes the music to depths beyond reality.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I wept from pure joy at his God given gift. There will never, ever be the likes of him again.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And we have this piece of film to remind us forever and ever that once there was such a man. God kissed him.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;God blessed him and squandered nothing, but loved it all. Michael knew how to put together every tone, every nuance to make magic.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;To say he was a genius seems so little. I wish my vocabulary encompassed what I feel.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You owe it to yourselves and your loved ones to see this again and again. Memorize it and say to yourselves, &#39;I saw genius in my lifetime.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I loved genius in my lifetime. God was so good to me. I will love Michael forever and so will you, if you don&#39;t already.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I hope I don&#39;t sound condescending. I&#39;m sure you already know what I&#39;m talking about, but go to see it again and again.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;If you listen to his lyrics they are those of a modern day prophet and it beseeches us to listen to him and what he sang.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I won&#39;t use words like preaching because that is off-putting, but listen.
