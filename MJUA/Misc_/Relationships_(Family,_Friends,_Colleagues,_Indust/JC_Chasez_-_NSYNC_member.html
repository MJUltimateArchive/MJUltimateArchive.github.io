J.C. CHASEZ, &#39;N SYNC: We have a lot of strange coincidences, actually. Our first hit single was a song called &quot;I Want You Back.&quot; His first hit single was &quot;I Want You Back&quot; with the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But really, what it was about is we were a group that wanted to emulate that kind of performance. We -- he was, kind of like Diddy said before, he just -- he presented something for my generation to emulate, you know. And it was about the scope of things. He just wanted to do it bigger, more dynamic. And he did. He made you believe in magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What was he like to work with?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CHASEZ: You know what? He was the nicest guy ever, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Very professional.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CHASEZ: Professional, but you know what? Surprisingly, it was -- when you first meet somebody that you look up to you&#39;re a little awestruck. Because you have an idea in your mind of what they are. And then you meet somebody backstage, and they&#39;re champing on a sandwich or something and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, OK, so you eat like me.&quot; Then, you know, he cracked a joke and made everybody comfortable right away.</span></p></body>
