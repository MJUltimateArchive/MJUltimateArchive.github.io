But as the band&rsquo;s Patrick Simmons reminded us during a recent conversation with Ultimate Classic Rock, rumors aren&rsquo;t always true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Simmons refuted the rumor point blank when asked about it, explaining, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. He was kidding around while someone had a<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://youtu.be/Z1celUDsCWE"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://youtu.be/Z1celUDsCWE"><span class="cs8567212B">video camera going</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">. I don&rsquo;t know if he ever told her the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, as Simmons went on to tell us, a Doobies/MJ team-up actually could have happened during the &lsquo;Minute by Minute&rsquo; sessions, if only the band had thought to ask. &ldquo;He was a good guy &mdash; he was always hanging around a lot, and he did come into the studio for our rehearsals once in awhile,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;I wish we had called him in for that, and I know he would have done it in a second, but I don&rsquo;t think it ever entered our heads to invite him. I don&rsquo;t know why &mdash; I guess because we were a band and we wanted to do everything ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For anyone who took the rumor at face value, it might make you feel better to know that even if Jackson&rsquo;s voice isn&rsquo;t present in the mix for &lsquo;Minute by Minute,&rsquo; that doesn&rsquo;t mean they never performed together. As Simmons explains, &ldquo;He did come and sing backgrounds with us on several occasions at shows.&rsquo;</span></p></body>
