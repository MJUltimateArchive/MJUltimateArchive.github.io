Every night was an amazing show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he was just different. He -- I think he knew what it was that set him apart, and he tapped into it every night. And 75,000 screaming fans were right there in the palm of his hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And you know, he had a different take on life. He was famous from the time he was 5. And so his relationship from people was from having been just mobbed all the time. So he was a little bit isolated by definitely a child at heart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You know, he would rent out amusement parks and take the band. We&#39;d go to Tokyo Disneyland, and ride rides all night. And he was a real prankster. Loved practical jokes. And you know, just really child -- when he stepped out on that stage, you&#39;d never seen anything that was more professional or more -- really truly more gifted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
