After completing the album, it did not go as planned and we had to cancel the project. I was very upset. And then John McClain said, &quot;Do not worry Freeze. I have another project for you. You&#39;ll be in business with Michael.&quot; I said: &quot;Michael ... who?&quot; And he said: &quot;Michael Jackson!&quot; I did not believe it at first and I thought it was crazy. And then one day I was on the phone with my father and someone called me on the other line...And it was Michael! That&#39;s how it all began. I had some songs that I made for Michael. He adored them! Because Michael and I, we have a knack for melody. So every time I proposed something, it was easy for him to study the song because it was as if he already knew. I gave him some songs that he adored. He cherished them. That&#39;s how we met.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
