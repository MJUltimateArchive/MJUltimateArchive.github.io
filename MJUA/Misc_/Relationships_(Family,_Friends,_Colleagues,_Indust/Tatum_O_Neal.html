He used to dance with me, we&#39;d talk on the phone all the time, and he&rsquo;d say how funny it was that I was 12 and I could drive and he was older and couldn&rsquo;t. Michael used to come to my house when I was living with my dad, and I remember him being so shy. Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn&rsquo;t even sit on my bed. But another time when he was over, he played the drums, my brother played guitar, and someone else played another instrument, and we had a jam session. I had the tape of it, but I lost it somewhere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I was 12, he asked me to go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, and my agent at the time said it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea, maybe because they felt he wasn&rsquo;t a big enough star yet. He never talked to me after that. I think he thought I just canceled, but it wasn&rsquo;t me at all. I was a child doing what I was told. I want you to print that, because I don&rsquo;t think he ever knew that. I lost touch with him because of it, so I don&rsquo;t really know him anymore. But I love him; he&rsquo;s one of the nicest, most innocent people I&rsquo;ve ever met. I love &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out of My Life&rdquo; because I think it describes our friendship at that time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/author/lacienega/"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/author/lacienega/"><span class="cs8567212B">lacienega</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> on November 13, 2011 in<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/category/relationships/1977-1979-tatum-oneal/"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/category/relationships/1977-1979-tatum-oneal/"><span class="cs8567212B">1977-1979 Tatum O&#39;Neal</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/category/relationships/1977-1979-tatum-oneal/"></a><span class="csD5D7D290">	 	</span><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">(Tatum was born on the 5th November, 1963.

At the time, he was seventeen and she was twelve. They had no contact with each other again until the spring of 1977, when Michael spotted Tatum with her father at the On the Rox club in Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Photos of them together at a party at The Roxy, 1977</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE"><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image0.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image1.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image2.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image3.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image4.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image5.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image6.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image7.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /><img src="Tatum%20O_Neal_files/image8.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">The Michael Jackson Story 1977</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The singer had been seen many times in the company of adolescent actress Tatum O&rsquo;Neal. After the critical acclaim she received acting with her father Ryan in Paper Moon she was in the same position as Michael. Everywhere she went Tatum was the centre of attraction. Michael could empathize with the pressures of child stardom and found in her a kindred spirit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In fact reports reached the press that the relationship had turned torrid at Hugh Hefner&rsquo;s Los Angeles mansion and that they had taken a nude sauna bath together. &ldquo;Well, I guess I am dating her in a way,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken her out a couple of times &mdash; or she&rsquo;s taken me out &mdash; whatever. &lsquo;I met her sometime back, when Paul McCartney gave a party on the Queen Mary boat. She was there and we talked a bit. Two years went by before I saw her again, which was at a club on Sunset Blvd called the Roxy. We talked and talked and talked. The next day she invited me to join her at Hugh Hefner&rsquo;s house to watch Roots on videotape. She got sort of bored, so we went outside and got into the jacuzzi. We weren&rsquo;t naked as people have said. We both had on bathing suits, just enjoying ourselves. And that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Magic&amp;Madness regarding their first few dates, p. 196, &#39;91 ed</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next day, thirteen-year-old Tatum invited Michael to a dinner party at Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner&rsquo;s rambling Holmby Hills estate, long a playpen for the chic Beverly Hills jet set. There they watched Roots, the highly rated Alex Haley television miniseries, on videotape. When Tatum became bored, she asked Michael to go into the hot tub with her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have a bathing suit,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Who needs bathing suits?&rdquo; Tatum responded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael began to blush, Tatum asked one of Hefner&rsquo;s assistants for two swimsuits, then handed one to Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tatum&rsquo;s hair at this time was soft blond and flowed just below her shoulders. Her skin was baby pink and her figure quite ample for a girl who wouldn&rsquo;t turn fourteen until close to the end of the year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She was almost plump. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like a sacred doll,&rdquo; Michael said of her to a friend. He said that while soaking in the water and watching for shooting stars, the two shared secrets with one another.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eventually, rumor has it they were nude together in the hot tub. The idea was tantalizing to the public, and the rumor persisted for months, fed by Tatum&rsquo;s fast-life reputation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t naked,&rdquo; Michael firmly pointed out in an interview, &ldquo;as people have said. We both had on bathing suits, just enjoying ourselves. And that&rsquo;s it. Why do people have to always find something dirty in everything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Todd Gold&#39;s book on their first few dates</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He wasn&rsquo;t used to being touched in a romantic way by pretty young ladies, and when Tatum&rsquo;s gentle hand rested upon his, Michael&rsquo;s heart melted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On their first official date they went to Hugh Hefner&rsquo;s Playboy Mansion, an enormous stone castle in Holmby Hills, with a reputation for being an orgiastic playground. Inside, the rooms were generally dark and full of leather furniture. The rambling backyard was home to Hef&rsquo;s envious collection of exotic animals, not the least of which were the many shapely young women who regularly lounged topless poolside in all their pneumatic splendour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Halfway through the movie they were watching, Tatum, then fifteen years old and light years ahead of Michael in sophistication, led her more innocent date outside for some fun and relaxation in the backyard. Discarding their clothes they slipped into the roiling hot tub. In recounting the incident, Michael says they had their swimming suits on, but mansion insiders say they were indeed skinny-dipping.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Consequently, the bare facts remain buried in a frothy sea of bubbles but Michael&rsquo;s sexual preference seemed clear. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell the details of that evening since I wasn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Marlon says, &ldquo;But Michael definitely isn&rsquo;t gay. He&rsquo;s not as innocent as people think. When it came to girls in the early days, he and Jermaine were something to keep up with. Michael definitely isn&rsquo;t a virgin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael telling Hilburn about Tatum, Hilburn, Cornflakes with John Lennon, p. 160</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;when I asked [Michael] about supposed encounters with Tatum O&rsquo;Neal, his eyes got big as he told me about the time at the Roxy that she had actually put her hand on his knee under the table.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Susan Blonde in Ron Galella&#39;s book about Michael and Tatum at The Roxy</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I introduced Michael to Tatum O&rsquo;Neal at On the Rox in Hollywood.

When we&rsquo;re together, he hardly says two words. I know he&rsquo;s a virgin. Someone needs to have a talk with him about it. I wonder if he&rsquo;s afraid to have sex. He doesn&rsquo;t seem very interested.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s romance with Tatum lasted a couple of years and apparently ended the night of a Hollywood party at the guest house at Rod Stewart&rsquo;s Beverly Hills home in 1979. The occasion was a rock concert Michael had attended with Tatum and some of her friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A lawsuit has been filed regarding reported events that allegedly took place at that party. According to one published report in Star magazine, Tatum persuaded Michael to go with her and a few friends, including model novelist Carole Mallory, to a small party at Rod Stewart&rsquo;s. Stewart was not home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to the assertions of the complaint filed by Carole Mallory in her lawsuit, Alasdair Buchan reported that Tatum tried to convince Michael to have sex with her and Carole Mallory. Mallory and O&rsquo;Neal were supposed to have made a pact that this evening would be &ldquo;let&rsquo;s bed Jackson night.&rdquo; Mallory reportedly told O&rsquo;Neal, &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t want him, I&rsquo;ll have him, darling.&rdquo; To which Tatum said, &ldquo;Even better, why don&rsquo;t we let him decide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two starlets then supposedly climbed into a bed with actor Leif Garrett. &ldquo;Come to bed with Carole and me,&rdquo; Buchan reported Tatum O&rsquo;Neal as having told Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the other at the party cheered him on, the shy Michael stood up and headed for the bedroom with Tatum and a scantily dressed Mallory. But Buchanan reported that, in the end, Michael refused their offer of sex. As a result, he was taunted and embarrassed in front of the other party goers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to &ldquo;Starfucking as Research&rdquo; a Playboy magazine article about Carole Mallory, the &ldquo;ex model was inspired by her nights under the stars &ndash; some forty celebs, she says,&rdquo; to write a sexy Hollywood novel, Flash, published in 1988. The dust jacket of Flash describes the book as portraying &ldquo;the wild fantasies, the perverse desires, the amorous delights the way a woman really experiences them. And what the boys don&rsquo;t know, Carole Mallory tells.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Even though Carole Mallory is popular for living a rather sensational life style, when asked to clarify the accuracy of the report thtat she and Tatum O&rsquo;Neal tried to seduce Michael Jackson, she became outraged and indignant. &ldquo;How dare you? How dare you ask me such a question?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you so much as use my name in your book, I will sue you, I swear it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next dat Mallory&rsquo;s attorney, Elliot Livingstone, reiterated her threat. Finally, Mallory would insist that the story was not true, and that she was suing the tabloids that published it. Indeed, she did file suit against The Star and NOTW for $50 million, in September 1988, claiming that &ldquo;as a result of the extraordinary personal effort, struggle and hardship, [I} for at least approximately eight years [have] been and [continue] to be a reformed and rehabilitated alcohol, cocaine and sex addict.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whatever really happened that night remains a mystery, Michael Jackson has never commented on the matter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael mentions Tatum, Ebony, September 1979</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bIA6iL8dktsC&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=jane%20fonda%20michael%20jackson&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">Source</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bIA6iL8dktsC&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=jane%20fonda%20michael%20jackson&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false"></a><span class="csD5D7D290">At 21, Michael is unmarried but is reported to have &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; going with actress Tatum O Neal, who is 15.</span><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael says that he has &ldquo;plenty of time&rdquo; to think about marriage, and he is not eager to discuss his friendship with Ryan O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s daughter Tatum, 15.

We met at a club on Sunset Strip called On the Rox. We exchanged phone numbers and called each other often. I talked to her for hours: from the road, from the studio, from home. On our first date we went to a party at Hugh Hefner&rsquo;s Playboy Mansion and had a great time. She had held my hand for the first time that night at On the Rox. When we met, I was sitting at this table and all of a sudden I felt this soft hand reach over and grab mine. It was Tatum. This probably wouldn&rsquo;t mean a lot to other people, but it was serious stuff to me. She touched me . That&rsquo;s how I felt about it. In the past, girls had always touched me on tour; grabbing at me and screaming, behind a wall of security guards. But this was different, this was one-on-one, and that&rsquo;s always the best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ours developed into a real close relationship. I fell in love with her (and she with me) and we were very close for a long time. Eventually the relationship transcended into a good friendship.

Tatum, just fifteen then, was in some ways more sophisticated than Michael, running with an older, faster crowd. We always found it so strange that her father, actor Ryan O&rsquo;Neal, regularly left her and her younger brother Griffin unsupervised for days at a time, but for them, and many kids in Hollywood, that was considered normal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Tatum speaks about Michael, VIBE magazine; June/July 1995</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I never worked with Michael, but he and I had a really wonderful friendship when I was 12 and he was 17. He used to dance with me, we&rsquo;d talk on the phone all the time, and he&rsquo;d say how funny it was that I was 12 and I could drive and he was older and couldn&rsquo;t. Michael used to come to my house when I was living with my dad, and I remember him being so shy. Once he came into my bedroom, and he wouldn&rsquo;t even sit on my bed. But another time when he was over, he played the drums, my brother played guitar, and someone else played another instrument, and we had a jam session. I had the tape of it, but I lost it somewhere.When I was 12, he asked me to go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, and my agent at the time said it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea, maybe because they felt he wasn&rsquo;t a big enough star yet. He never talked to me after that. I think he thought I just canceled, but it wasn&rsquo;t me at all. I was a child doing what I was told. I want you to print that, because I don&rsquo;t think he ever knew that. I lost touch with him because of it, so I don&rsquo;t really know him anymore. But I love him; he&rsquo;s one of the nicest, most innocent people I&rsquo;ve ever met. I love &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out of My Life&rdquo; because I think it describes our friendship at that time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael speaks about Tatum, Rabbi Schmuley&#39;s book, conversations in 2000/1</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, my first girlfriend, Tatum O&rsquo;Neal she&rsquo;d won the Academy Award for Paper Moon&hellip; I was 16, she was 13.

I have a great deal of respect for Michael Jackson as an artist and as a person. However, he has a very vivid imagination. His comments about our friendship were inaccurate.

Michael was around 17 at the time, about 5 years older than me, &amp; he seemed very sheltered &amp; fearful &amp; lonely&ndash;not at all what you&rsquo;d expect a world-renowned performer to be. As I recall, he didn&rsquo;t even know how to drive a car.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He gave me his number, and we started talking everyday&ndash;long drawn-out conversations that sometimes got so boring I would hand over the receiver to my friend Esme Gray. Michael would just keep on, thinking he was talking to me. His usual subject was sex. At 12 I didn&rsquo;t have much to say about sex&ndash;all I knew was that it went on, pretty steadily, in my father&rsquo;s room next to mine. But Michael was intensely curious about anything, everything sexual, though in an incredibly sweet &amp; innocent way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was a huge star, but it seemed he barely even dated &amp; knew little about life. He once came to my house and asked to come upstairs because he&rsquo;d never been in a girl&rsquo;s bedroom before. He sat on thebed, and we kissed very briefly, but it was terribly awkward. For all my passionate crushes on people like Dustin Hoffman, I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter. So I said,&rsquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said,&rsquo;Uh, gotta go.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&rsquo;s the closest I ever got to Michael, which is why I&rsquo;m amazed by his recent claim on national TV that I&rsquo;d seduced him but he was too shy to carry it through. I absolutely adored Michael&ndash;as a friend&ndash;and I admire him to this day. I believe that he fell in love with me. I&rsquo;m told that he wrote the song &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Out of My Life&rdquo; on his album Off the Wall for me. What an honor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the time of the supposed seduction, I was barely pubescent, and what I&rsquo;d seen of sex so far was unappealling &amp; gross. It may have been Michael&rsquo;s fantasy that I&rsquo;d seduce him&ndash;and it&rsquo;s a little sad that he cast himself as failing, even in his dream&ndash;but it just didn&rsquo;t happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately, my friendship with Michael came to an abrupt ending. He&rsquo;d played the Scarecrow in The Wiz, the urban remake of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross as Dorothy. For the film&rsquo;s premiere, Michael invited me to be his date. I asked my dad, who didn&rsquo;t care one way or another if I went, but my talent agency was dead set against it. I was told, in exactly these words: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go to a premiere with a ni**er.&rsquo; Hollywood!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That upset me tremendously. Had I been old enough&ndash;or had I the parental support&ndash;I could have stood my ground &amp; insisted &lsquo;Oh yes, I can.&rsquo; But my father was too disengaged to help me think it through. So, without telling Michael the reason, I turned him down. He was devastated. After that Michael didn&rsquo;t speak to me for years, until I ran into him at the Helmsley Palace in New York. For old times&rsquo; sake, we caught a concert together, Kool and the Gang at Madison Square Garden. Michael dressed in full costume for the event&ndash;coming in blackface, with a pasted-on beard&ndash;the whole nine yards. But things were never the same between us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> Tatum O&#39;Neal, Newsweek, October 25, 2004</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">You were friends with Michael Jackson.

Every time I kind of bring up the bad stuff, it just doesn&rsquo;t go towards making a healing and getting us to a better place. I know for sure my dad made a lot of mistakes.

She can&rsquo;t stop saying it. Why? Why does she do that? It&rsquo;s because she needs a reason for why she collapsed. Why her career and her marriage, her children, they all went south. Why did that happen? Because I had a terrible childhood. She had a wonderful childhood. She met Queen Elizabeth. She traveled the world. She was a millionairess by the time she was 12.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Does that make you &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">O&rsquo;NEAL: It doesn&rsquo;t hurt, OK.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Doesn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">O&rsquo;NEAL: It doesn&rsquo;t hurt, no.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Can it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">O&rsquo;NEAL: She had a career.

OK?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs2274D24">&quot;Found: A Daughter&#39;s Journey Home,&quot; Tatum O&#39;Neal, released June 14th 2011</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I was a teenager, I discovered that some people, mostly women, befriended me to get to Ryan. That was an eye-opener, and I discovered that there was a safety in people who were already known or successful on their own terms. When I dated Andy Gibb and Michael Jackson, I know they weren&rsquo;t going out with me because of who I was. They didn&rsquo;t need me. The same was true with John.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[...]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then he added &ldquo;You were sixteen, then seventeen, and you were going through all kinds of changes that I wasn&rsquo;t comfortable with. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand all this growth-hormone stuff. The boyfriends. Michael Jackson adored you. That was all right with me. But nobody else. &rdquo; This was my father, not the all-powerful god I worshiped as a child but a young man saddled with an adolescent daughter he didn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs3ECCE17C">&uArr;</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7"> </span><span class="cs2274D24">Jermaine talks about Michael and Tatum&#39;s relationship, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; by Jermaine Jackson, released Septemeber 2011</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The secluded privacy of [my ranch/beach house] appealed to [Michael]. That was presumably what appealed to my neighbors, too: actors Ryan O&rsquo;Neal (four doors down) and Beau Bridges (directly next door). It was during my morning runs on the beach that I used to wave at Ryan&rsquo;s daughter, Tatum, as she stood on the balcony. She was a 13 year old child star at the time, having won an Oscar at the age of 10 for Best Supporting Actress in Paper Moon. I told Michael there was &ldquo;this real pretty girl&rdquo; living nearby and, coincidentally, he started showing up at the beach house more and more at weekends. But here&rsquo;s the ironic thing: they waved at each other but never spoke until they bumped into one another in a club on Sunset Strip.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meant to be,&rdquo; I joked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, we&rsquo;re just friends,&rdquo; he said, playing down its importance. But it was obvious from Tatum&rsquo;s visits to Hayvenhurst that they were boyfriend and girlfriend. She was clearly smitten and he was giddy around her, but Michael was guarded about when and where he saw her. I don&rsquo;t remember one visit to Malibu when he left my house to see her, or they met at the beach. Which seemed odd, but Michael&rsquo;s sense of privacy and discretion, even among his siblings, was notable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I am aware that Tatum has publicly distanced herself from being Michael&rsquo;s childhood sweetheart, but I don&rsquo;t think my brother suggested that they shared a blazing passionate love affair. It was nothing but puppy love. But what matters is that, in my brother&rsquo;s heart and mind, Tatum was his first girlfriend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></body>
