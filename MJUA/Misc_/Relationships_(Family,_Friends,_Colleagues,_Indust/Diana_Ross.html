Still, it was hard for me, because I had to walk around pretending to be overwhelmed that Diana was getting married to this man I&rsquo;d never met. I wanted her to be happy, but I have to admit that I was a bit hurt and a little jealous because I&rsquo;ve always loved Diana and always will.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lisa Robinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;There Goes Gravity: A Life in Rock and Roll&rdquo; autobiography</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1996, Diana Ross told me, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Michael or spent any time with him in years and I know nothing of who he is anymore. I know the little boy that I introduced on the Ed Sullivan show, so [to talk about him now] is hard. Careers can just be devastating for young people.

What advice would you give him if he asked?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">DIANA: You know I would never involve myself with something as personal as that, decisions like making major changes in your life. Each person has to do a lot of soul-searching and make his or her own decision and be responsible for that. But I&#39;m crazy about Michael and I love him a lot. He&rsquo;s been my inspiration. He&#39;s a very gentle, wonderful human being, one of the special ones in this universe, and I don&rsquo;t even know if he knows how special he is. So whenever I can be around him, I like it. You like to rub shoulders with talent. He&rsquo;s got good vibrations. His aura is only about love. So I like being with him. I have a feeling that he is going to be, if he isn&rsquo;t already, a tremendous [record] producer. He is already co-producing with Quincy Jones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">1971</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627"><img src="Diana%20Ross_files/image0.jpg" width="329" height="241" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">Michael Jackson, age 12, 1970</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Diana Ross has told me that people in show business can get hurt.

I was amazed to hear those temporary accommodations happened to be the Hollywood Hills home of Diana Ross. Diana and the boys became attached immediately.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON: The time spent at Diana&rsquo;s was one of the best times of my life; we got to do whatever we wanted to do. Diana was a kid in some ways, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We&rsquo;d just tear up. Boy, we had fun! Diana, Michael, and I would go swimming all day. To encourage our interest art, she bought paint supplies, including several easels that she set up in the living room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But more often than not, our painting sessions would turn into big paint fights. We really did a number on her white shag carpet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; was being released in October, the Jackson Five made their network TV debut on &ldquo;The Hollywood Palace.&rdquo; The guest host was none other than Diana Ross, making her farewell appearance with the Supremes. I watched with baited breath from my living room in Gary, with LaToya, Randy, and Janet at my side.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After she and the Supremes opened the show with a melody from the Broadway musical Hair, Diana took the microphone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to return as your hostess,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;especially tonight, when I have the pleasure of introducing a great young star who has been in the business all of his life. He has worked with his family, and when he sings and dances, he lights up the stage.

But with Diana&rsquo;s encouragement he went ahead and auditioned in front of director Sidney Lumet for the role of the Scarecrow. To Michael&rsquo;s delight, Mr. Lumet loved his audition and chose him for the part.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diana Ross was a big support throughout the shooting. Michael referred to her as &ldquo;my mama&rdquo; on the set. She made a habit of checking in on him in his dressing room each morning. However, there were some moments during the dance rehearsals when Diana was probably pretty upset with Michael. Michael learned his dance moves so fast from the choreographer that he wound up unintentionally showing up everyone else, including Diana.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael, wait a minute!&rdquo; she&rsquo;d have to tell him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it so fast.

In one scene the Scarecrow had to pick up Dorothy, who had fainted. Michael later recalled the rather humorous incident: &ldquo;the funniest thing was a scene we were doing on the rooftop. Diana was supposed to faint, and I had to pick her up. But she was too heavy. I kept puffing away on the dialogue while I tried over and over again to lift her, until I finally made it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">Record Mirror, October 22 1977</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One person Michael isn&rsquo;t new to is Diana Ross who plays the lead role of Dorothy.

He said that he eventually got hold of them on the phone and was surprised to find they were in his apartment and that she had apparently spent the night there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When this assistant asked Michael if anything had happened between them, Michael said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d have to ask her that,&rdquo; and when he asked Diana, she told him he needed to ask Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later on during the shoot Diana was apparently overheard talking to some girlfriends of hers and said to one of them, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, Michael definitely isn&rsquo;t gay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csBB278F22">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">London, Disco Dancing, 1978</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The movie gave Michael a chance to team up with an old friend, the legendary and beautiful, Diana Ross.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Diana looked after us a lot when we first started. She and I became good friends. I used to stay with her whenever we&rsquo;d come up to New York.

You&rsquo;re about to get out there in the world and meet a lot of people&ndash;a lot of women. And you might run into some interesting situations. Sometimes it&rsquo;s difficult for you to go to your parents or your brothers and talk about those kind of things. But I want you to know that I&rsquo;m there for you. That any time you need a friend, in any kind of situation, I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo; Michael smiles. He was touched. &ldquo;God, that is so sweet of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I already have someone I confide in like that.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, great,&rdquo; Colomby replied, mildly surprised. &ldquo;Can I ask who?&rdquo; &ldquo;Diana Ross&rdquo; Michael replied.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">October 24, 1978</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael attends the premiere &amp; opening night party of the movie The Wiz at the Pitt&rsquo;s Century Plaza Theater in Century City (Los Angeles) with the Jackson family &amp; Diana Ross among others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csA397CD7A">People, January 15th 1979</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Her supporters on the set included Michael Jackson, 20, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Diana&rsquo;s ever since his family Five began. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so beautiful, inside and out,&rdquo; he gushes, &ldquo;and she can talk about anything: jewelry, hairstyles, est.&rdquo; Then there was a new admirer, Wiz director Sidney Lumet, who declares that &ldquo;watching Diana is like watching this supernova exploding&mdash;she&rsquo;s stunning.&rdquo; But, admirers aside, there&rsquo;s no romance in her life. Diana hasn&rsquo;t had a strong, steady pair of arms since the divorce. &ldquo;I had a lovely marriage,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When you find someone that you can enjoy a lot of the same pleasures with&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s sitting in front of the television late at night with a big sandwich&mdash;it&rsquo;s terrific.

Throughout the session, Michael tended to look away from the camera and directly into the lens, and he only smiled once of twice during the forty-five-minute shoot. We barely spoke to one another, not wanting to break the spell. I made minimal hand gestures to direct him, and I would nod and hum approvingly when I was sure I got something special.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later, when I showed him the proof sheets of the photo session, he ordered two large prints of every picture, which was highly unusual. Typically, if someone orders one or two pictures from a session, it&rsquo;s considered a success. I was blown away. &ldquo;Two of every single one? That&rsquo;s about 144 prints&hellip; Michael answered, &ldquo;Yes, I can count. I want one set for myself and one for Diana [Ross]. Todd, this is magic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mmake.html"><span class="cs8DEFAF43">Melody Maker, March 1, 1980</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mmake.html"></a><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Every day [Diana Ross] would stop in my room and ask me if I wanted anything.

The other is that she initiated him into manhood before he &ldquo;slipped away entirely&rdquo;. Whatever the truth, Michael clearly has a very strong attachment to her, and she to him, though her expressed knowledge of him isn&rsquo;t as thorough or intimate as one might expect: &ldquo;Michael has a lot of people around him but he&rsquo;s very afraid.

Michael said, &ldquo;Are you reading this book?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t read this book. Mary is so jealous of Diana. You should have seen her at the Motown 25th special&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;He just went on and on recounting, as if I were there.&rdquo; Sam recalls, &ldquo;So I jokingly said to him that I knew just what he was talking about, I spoke to Diana last night.

Three in a row.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So Diana didn&rsquo;t find us first, but I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll ever be able to repay Diana properly for all she did for us in those days. When we finally moved to Southern California, we actually lived with Diana and stayed with her for more than a year on a part-time basis. Some of us lived with Berry Gordy and some of us with Diana, and then we would switch. She was so wonderful, mothering us and making us feel right at home. She really helped take care of us for at least a year and a half while my parents closed up the Gary house and looked for a house we could all live in here in California. It was great for us because Berry and Diana lived on the same street in Beverly Hills. We could walk up to Berry&rsquo;s house and then go back to Diana&rsquo;s. Most of the time I&rsquo;d spend the day at Diana&rsquo;s and the night at Berry&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was an important period in my life because Diana loved art and encouraged me to appreciate it too. She took the time to educate me about it. We&rsquo;d go out almost every day, just the two of us, and buy pencils and paint. When we weren&rsquo;t drawing or painting, we&rsquo;d go to museums. She introduced me to the works of the great artists like Michelangelo and Degas and that was the start of my lifelong interest in art. She really taught me a great deal. It was so new to me and exciting. It was really different from what I was used to doing, which was living and breathing music, rehearsing day in and day out. You wouldn&rsquo;t think a big star like Diana would take the time to teach a kid to paint, to give him an education in art, but she did and I loved her for it. I still do. I&rsquo;m crazy about her. She was my mother, my lover, and my sister all combined in one amazing person.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; came out, everyone at Motown prepared us for success. Diana loved it and presented us at a big-name Hollywood discotheque, where she had us playing in a comfortable party atmosphere like at Berry&rsquo;s. Following directly on the heels of Diana&rsquo;s event came an invitation to play at the &ldquo;Miss Black America&rdquo; telecast. Being on the show would enable us to give people a preview of our record and our show. After we got the invitation, my brothers and I remembered our disappointment at not getting to go to New York to do our first TV show because Motown had called. Now we were going to do our first TV show and we were with Motown. Life was very good. Diana, of course, put the cherry on top. She was going to host &ldquo;The Hollywood Palace,&rdquo; and big Saturday night show; it would be her last appearance with the Supremes and the first major exposure for us. This meant a lot to Motown, because by then they had decided that our new album would be called &ldquo;Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5.&rdquo; Never before had a superstar like Diana passed the torch to a bunch of kids. Motown, Diana, and five kids from Gary, Indiana, were all pretty excited. By then &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; had come out, and Berry was proven right again; all the stations that played Sly and the Beatles were playing us, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was already a devoted fan of film and animation by the time &ldquo;The Jackson Five&rdquo; Saturday morning cartoon show started appearing over network television in 1971. Diana Ross had enhanced my appreciation of animation when she taught me to draw, but being a cartoon character pushed me over the brink into a full-time love of the movies and the kind of animated motion pictures pioneered by Walt Disney. I have such admiration for Mr. Disney and what he accomplished with the help of so many talented artists. When I think about the joy he and his company have brought to millions of children &ndash; and adults &ndash; the world over, I am in awe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Motown bought The Wiz for one reason, and as far as I was concerned, it was the best reason possible: Diana Ross.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diana was close to Berry Gordy and had her loyalties to him and to Motown, but she did not forget us just because our records now had a different label on them. We had been in touch throughout the changes, and she had even met up with us in Las Vegas, where she gave us tips during our run there. Diana was going to play Dorothy, and since it was the only part that was definitely cast, she encouraged me to audition. She also assured me that Motown would not keep me from getting a part just to spite me or my family. She would make sure of that if she had to, but she didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d have to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She didn&rsquo;t. It was Berry Gordy who said he hoped I&rsquo;d audition for The Wiz .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When we were doing The Wiz , I was being instructed in the choreography along with my characters &ndash; the Tin Man, the Lion, and Diana Ross &ndash; and they were getting mad at me. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was wrong until Diana took me aside and told me that I was embarrassing her. I just stared at her. Embarrassing Diana Ross? Me? She said she knew I wasn&rsquo;t aware of it, but I was learning the dances much too quickly. It was embarrassing for her and the others, who just couldn&rsquo;t learn steps as soon as they saw the choreographer do them. She said he&rsquo;d show us something and I&rsquo;d just go out there and do it. When he asked the others to do it, it took them longer to learn. We laughed about it, but I tried to make the ease with which I learned my steps less obvious.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The problems on the set were really few and far between and it was great working with Diana so closely. She&rsquo;s such a beautiful, talented woman. Doing this movie together was very special for me. I love her very much. I have always loved her very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I still enjoy seeing The Wiz and reliving the experience. I am especially fond of the scene where Diana asks, &ldquo;What am I afraid of? Don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m made of . . .&rdquo; because I&rsquo;ve felt that way many times, even during the good moments of my life. She sings about overcoming fear and walking straight and tall. She knows and the audience knows that no threat of danger can hold her back.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diana&rsquo;s singing and dancing and acting have stayed with me ever since. She was a perfect Dorothy. After the evil witch had been defeated, the sheer joy of our dancing took over. To dance with Diana in that movie was like an abridged version of my own story &ndash; my knock-kneed walk and &ldquo;bigfoot&rdquo; spin were me in my early days; our tabletop dance in the sweatshop scene was where we were right then.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs149F4627">[&hellip;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Tatum and I] developed into a real close relationship. I fell in love with her (and she with me) and we were very close for a long time. Eventually the relationship transcended into a good friendship. We still talk now and then, and I guess you&rsquo;d have to sayshe was my first love &ndash; after Diana. When I heard Diana Ross was getting married, I was happy for her because I knew it would make her very joyous. Still, it was hard for me, because I had to walk around pretending to be overwhelmed that Diana was getting married to this man I&rsquo;d never met. I wanted her to be happy, but I have to admit that I was a bit hurt and a little jealous because I&rsquo;ve always loved Diana and always will.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=eg0h3&amp;s=5"><span class="cs8DEFAF43">Michael, Interview about Bad, 1988</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=eg0h3&amp;s=5"></a><span class="cs31D24DEE">Interviewer: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">[Diana] Ross discovered the Jacksons when you were only 10.

He cares about animals and nature, and he believes that with a positve attitude we can have whatever we want. He would like to produce and direct, and I believe that he will have those opprotunities. Whatever he does I hope that he never stops making his beautiful music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was about eleven when we met. He was artistic, a quality that he and I shared. I remember that we used to go out to buy paints and easles and we did artwork together. He was always wonderful to be around. I am pleased that I touched him in the early days of his life, and I am sad now I dont have time to see him more often and to know him better. Careers have a way of separating people. Whether we are together or apart, my love for him never stops. It makes me happy that at one time we were close and that he cares for me. My love for him remains very dear, and our friendship will always be very important to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When the Jackson 5 first came to California, they all moved in with me. They have always been good to me. Despite the negative things that have been written about them, I knew them to be a unique family. People have picked them apart and gossiped about what they did or didn&rsquo;t do, but in my eyes Michael&rsquo;s mother is a very special and loving woman. The strength in those Jackson kids exists because of the strength and character of their father. Parenting is never easy. If you&rsquo;re too hard, you lose the kids; if you&rsquo;re too easy, you also lose them. Some fathers just have to be tough. Maybe if he hadn&rsquo;t been tough, the kids would never have arrived where they are today. Maybe the Jackson children will grow up to be very fine parents as a result of their own tough upbringing. I would like very much to see Michael settle down with a family of his own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was at this meeting that they told me they were considering Michael Jackson for the role of the Scarecrow, Dorothy&rsquo;s first friend along the path, who is looking for his brain, or deeper knowledge. I was enthusiastic. I thought it would be wonderful for Michael and me to work together. Michael and I were pretty close during that time. We spoke on the phone every couple of days and usually saw each other about once a week, when our careers permitted. Even though this would be Michael&rsquo;s very first acting role, I told them that I considered him an ideal choice. His personality suited the role, he was a superb dancer and there was a great deal of dancing designed for this lavish musical production, and we were already very close friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quote:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;&hellip;but Michael&rsquo;s makeup was a different story.It was probably the most difficult of anyone&rsquo;s in the film, and it certainly took the most time to apply. I remember seeing poor little Michael, he was very young and inexperienced then, sitting there every morning for hours and hours, having his makeup painstakingly done and redone. And then there was the added difficulty of removing it every night, a process that must have been quite damaging to his skin, a possible source for the severe skin problems that he is presently experiencing and doesn&rsquo;t want to speak about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl0DYtLE9kA&amp;feature=player_embedded"><span class="cs7CBD62A">Diana on Regis an Kathy Lee, December 1993</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl0DYtLE9kA&amp;feature=player_embedded"></a><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: One more movie now, The Wiz.

This worries her about her very dear friend Michael Jackson, who missed out not only on normal teen years but on a childhood as well. He has been the featured player since he was old enough to tie his shoes, never knew the inside of a school bus, and watched cartoon shows from the back seats of limousines. He was only ten when as part of the Jackson Five he came to live in Diana&rsquo;s Hollywood home once Motown moved west.

I know that my teacher, parents, sister have been my heros. I think I would travel miles to do the things that Princess Di did.
