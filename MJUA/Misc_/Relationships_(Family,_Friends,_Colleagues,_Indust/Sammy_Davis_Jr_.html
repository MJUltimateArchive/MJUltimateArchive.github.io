Visiting me in Monte Carlo in July of 88, he said, &rdquo;You know, I stole some moves from you, the attitudes.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d known that. It&#39;s terribly flattering for the young to feel that way about you. Especially Michael, who I think is the ultimate professional. A lot of young performers have become multimillionaires on ten big records, but they don&#39;t know how to bow and get themselves off stage. Everything Michael does on a stage, though, is exactly right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://people.com/archive/the-last-word-on-michael-vol-22-no-26/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;People&rdquo; (December 30, 1984)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012301/https://people.com/archive/the-last-word-on-michael-vol-22-no-26/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He takes a step that you&rsquo;ve been doing and then by the time he switches it around, you don&rsquo;t even recognize it. There is nothing new about thrusting your hips out, but when he does that with quick moves, the high kick out and that slow back-up step he does, people say, &ldquo;Jeez, what is he doing?&rdquo; And he never lays on a move long enough for you to figure it out. I&rsquo;m sure if he worked with Nureyev or Baryshnikov, he would come close to that level. Can he tap dance? I don&rsquo;t know. But then again I&rsquo;d hate to leave my dancing shoes in his vicinity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=07ADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22cry+of+the+city%22+%22michael+jackson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LY4tS3jq_q&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DENIMR0qtnmgGKsPVntRB2nnx5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiY4IuXirDjAhXGXc0KHZUkDuEQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cry%20of%20the%20city%22%20%22michael%20jackson%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Jet&rdquo; magazine (August 20, 1984)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190712202353/https://books.google.com/books?id=07ADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=%22cry+of+the+city%22+%22michael+jackson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LY4tS3jq_q&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DENIMR0qtnmgGKsPVntRB2nnx5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiY4IuXirDjAhXGXc0KHZUkDuEQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cry%20of%20the%20city%22%20%22michael%20jackson%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Sammy Davis Jr., the world&rsquo;s greatest variety performer, had lunch recently with the editors of ET and Ebony in Chicago, he talked of his relationship with Michael Jackson, the world&rsquo;s greatest recording artist whose Thriller album sold over 35 million copies. Sammy said Michael asked probing questions about various aspects of show business &ldquo;which I have experienced during my 50 years.&rdquo; To show his appreciation for the enlightenment, Michael taught Sammy how to break-dance and do the Moonwalk which the veteran entertainer will show off in the upcoming movie, Cry Of The City, produced by his filmmaker pal, Leon Kennedy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sammy Davis, Jr. first met Michael backstage at one of his shows at Lake Tahoe in 1970. Sammy was wearing a watch that night that Michael liked. Seeing how much Michael loved it Davis gave it him as a gift. In later years Michael gave the watch to his mother as a keepsake. Some years later Michael repaid the kind gesture by giving Davis the iconic sparkly jacket he wore for the Motown 25 performance of &lsquo;Billie Jean.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy Jones told Sammy Davis at his home where the song and dance man was holding a party, that Michael (then 12) was going to be the next big thing.</span></p></body>
