He shot some of Michael Jackson`s most remembered photos and created this portrait of Michael and Lisa Marie for their wedding. His 1982 cover for Michael`s &quot;Thriller&quot; album is iconic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dick Zimmerman joins us tonight. Dick, after you took the wedding portraits, you went, I guess, to Lisa Marie and Michael`s suite. What did you see there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dick Zimmerman: Well, it was a funny story. You know, I got there really late. Oh, it was about midnight. And, the maid let me in. And I hung around. It was kind of dark in there. And I asked when Michael was coming down. And I waited. It was a good half hour, and no Michael. So, I`m wondering what`s going on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I noticed there was a fellow standing next to a pole not too far away. And, I went over just to see, I thought maybe he was a bodyguard or something. And I said do you have any idea -- and I went closer and closer. I said, do you have any idea when Michael is coming down? You know, it was late. And, all of a sudden, I get closer and he starts laughing, and it`s Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was wearing a mustache and a beard. So you know, very playful. Very surprising. We laughed. It was really fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Did you eventually sort of develop a friendship with him after working with him for a while?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: I did. Well, that particular night was a very, very good night. We spent quite a bit of time, you know, having -- he opened up a bottle of wine, and he -- you know, we just talked. We talked about life. We went over the photographs that I created for him and Lisa. And he basically -- I got to know him more than ever that evening because he actually had tears in his eyes and he had just finished an interview with Diane Sawyer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I don`t remember. It was &quot;60 Minutes&quot; or something, and he took him around Neverland. and he said, I poured my heart out and I told the truth. I told them everything about me, and they twisted it around, you know? And he says, I don`t know what to do anymore, you know? I can`t -- I tell the truth, and it doesn`t work, you know? So, that`s --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: So, Dick, you sort of -- in a way, you have an opportunity to set the record straight. What is the truth? How do we understand this man?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: The truth about what? The truth about what he was like as a human being?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Yes. I mean, let`s put it -- let me, let me -- let`s break it down, first of all. He had some charges about having been a pedophile. And, I guess, you`re quoted as having said he was very child-like. But that`s not necessarily healthy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Right? Being child-like? In my world, that`s pathology. So, how do I understand all these -- these aspects of him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Well, you know, I would like to answer that question after I -- I wrote something down here regarding Michael and the trial and what he was like. And if you don`t mind, I`d like to read it to you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Please. It can`t be to long, but -- it`s live television.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: OK.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: I don`t have a couple minutes. I have like 30 seconds.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Thirty seconds? Oh, wow. OK.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Let`s see what you can do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Michael Jackson was an incredible artist, probably the most talented and dynamic entertainer in history. You know it`s tough enough for an average entertainer to maintain a successful career, but then, imagine maintaining the enormous magnitude of Michael`s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Having to continue to create perfection but having the obstacle of the media looking for ways out of jealousy or whatever with criticalness in order to fill up blank pages and newspapers. To suppress rather than to validate his talents or find ways to inspire it. Suppression, unfortunately, in this country, usually leads to drugs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sure, Dr. Murray is guilty of negligence and should be punished and take responsibility for his negligence. Dr. Murray just happened to be there at the end, the fall guy. But Michael started to die years ago, from trying to handle the suppression from his media attackers. They were constantly looking for ways to bring him down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We lost too many iconic performers to the media leading to suppression, leading to drugs, leading to death. Lady Gaga will most likely be next. I certainly hope not. I`m almost finished.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: OK.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Michael was highly misunderstood. He loved children, was totally concerned for their future on this environmentally strained planet. But compassionate. Very compassionate. Michael --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: I`m going to interrupt you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: One second.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: I appreciate your comments.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Please -- I`m almost there. I`m almost there. The media couldn`t have it any other way. OK? Michael is compassionate. No one can be that compassionate. So, let`s see how we can twist that into a negative. Oh, how about turning it into child molestation? Well, yes, that works.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyway, I`m glad that these drugs, slurred words from Michael are there to be read. Just turn off the volume and you will finally understand who Michael Jackson really was. So, thank you for letting me get that in there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: You`re quite welcome. I understand you`re also very passionate about a tribute painting that we`re going to actually put up on the screen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: I see now what your motivation is. Just explain to us what it means for you, and then, we have to go out on break.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: OK. Basically, I created this --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: There it is now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: OK. I basically created this tribute painting for Michael. It has -- it`s a montage filled with the images of the three photo sessions that I had with him, the &quot;Thriller&quot; session, the Spielberg session where he narrated the E.T. album, and my portraits, my exclusive portraits when he married Lisa Marie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I put that together in a painting. On the bottom right-hand corner is an 8 over 15, which represents the eight times that I either worked with Michael or socialized with him over the 15-year period. And, it has a lot of elements that have to do with Michael`s life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I would have to, you know, take some time to explain it. But, of course, we don`t have that time. But it was my tribute to Michael. Yes, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Thank you, Dick. I appreciate it very much. I appreciate you joining us. Very lovely tribute you`ve created there for Michael. And thank you for telling us your story and reading us --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: You`re welcome.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Your tribute and your feelings about Michael because you were somebody that was there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: Right. Thank you.</span></p></body>
