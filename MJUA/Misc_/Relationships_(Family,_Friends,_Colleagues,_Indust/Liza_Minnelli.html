And he was just a really splendid man. And a brilliant performer who changed theatrical history. I will miss him, I cannot tell you. I saw him all the time. He was so fascinated with everything. He wanted to learn. Once a week he&#39;d have dinner - when he was in Hollywood he&#39;d have dinner with Gregory Peck, and then another night he&#39;d have dinner with Fred Astaire, and another night with Gene Kelly,&quot; Minnelli told Smith.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And then every Tuesday night we had dinner. He was passionate about learning and about everything. My father adored him. He knew every word of every song in every film my father ever made. He burst into triplets and three little unexpected children, that thing when he was around my dad. He was so curious. When I took him to Martha Graham&#39;s for rehearsal, he was absolutely riveted and we went home, and he wanted to learn all of those steps. So I taught him. He was such a student of everything. The spacewalk was really done in vaudeville, but he took it and changed it and made it his own. If you notice in his early videos, his feet are kind of flat. You know, when he has the diamond outfit on. His feet are kind of flat. As you go on, he took Gene Kelly&#39;s socks, threw some glitter on them, and wore those. So you saw them all the time,&quot; she remembered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He wore just a silk shirt on stage. He didn&#39;t need anything,&quot; Minnelli said. &quot;He was passionate about learning. And we used to dance together all the time. It just. I loved him. He was just sensational. He&#39;s a great, great friend and a curious, curious man. And a dear, dear friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/26/lkl.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Larry King Live&rdquo; (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407003754/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/26/lkl.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What was your -- how did you hear about it, Liza?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LIZA MINNELLI, AWARD-WINNING ENTERTAINER, MICHAEL&#39;S FRIEND: Oh, Larry, I couldn&#39;t believe it, honey. I -- I got a call at 2:00 in the morning telling me that -- from a lawyer telling me some that some -- a lawyer, telling me that he&#39;s gone into cardiac arrest -- they said what had happened was that he had been complaining of chest pains, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was not on purpose. He was complaining saying there&#39;s really something wrong. And the doctor was with him and he went into cardiac arrest. You know? And all I remember is what a -- he was such a good friend. He was such a good man. You know, he was a lovely, lovely man and a genius. He changed show business history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You know that. You celebrate it all time. And I&#39;m going to miss him. I don&#39;t know. It hasn&#39;t hit me. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Yes, Liza...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: I have to perform tomorrow night in Paris.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: How did you first meet him? How did you first meet him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: I met him when he was about 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(LAUGHTER)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: And we met -- we met through a friend of his and his family was a mutual friend of mine. And I loved him right away. You know? He had no childhood. You know, he was pushed on stage by that father every second. They all were. And he was never allowed to be a kid. You know...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Did you...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: He was always in front of the camera or rehearsing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Liza, did you draw the similarity between Michael Jackson and your mother? Fame early?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: Yes, except she had more -- she had more of a personal life. You know, I mean, she came home and we&#39;d talk and dance and carry-on and laugh and she was there for me. She was there for me. I don&#39;t know what Michael had. But I don&#39;t think it was swell.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Yes. Well, it didn&#39;t have a happily ever after wedding. Your marriage to David Gest, that ended but more important than that, Michael was involved in that, wasn&#39;t he?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: Oh, he was the best man. But, you know, I saw him right after, you know, (INAUDIBLE), and I said, Michael, why didn&#39;t you tell me something? Why didn&#39;t you tell me? And he said, because I thought you knew. I said, did you think I was crazy? I don&#39;t know anything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we started to laugh. You know, that was our relationship. We talked all the time. All the time. In fact...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Well, you&#39;re...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: I thought maybe that he would come to the -- see me, you know, and -- but this thing is just a stunner and a lot of people are going to say a lot of things, but nobody knows for sure yet. There&#39;s no real...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You are, Liza, you are a great performer in your own right. What, from a show business standpoint...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: Thank you, Larry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: From a show business standpoint, what was his greatness?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: He changed show business. He changed show business. He suddenly -- he hit with a force that was spectacular as he started to grow up. And then he grew and grew and grew. All the time. He grew all the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You know, like I said, he had dinner with all these people all the time and he learned -- you can see from one song where his feet are kind of flat. Then you look at &quot;Thriller&quot; and you look at the arch in his dance foot. It was spectacular.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was constantly learning and growing. He just loved it. And he did change history. Nothing was the same after Michael and I&#39;m afraid nothing is going to be the same ever really again. It won&#39;t be for me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...KING: Liza, you look unhappy. We don&#39;t want to make you unhappy. What are you feeling?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: No, no, no, sweetheart. I was just thinking how repulsive that reporter [who bugged Michael and defense attorney Mark Geragos&rsquo; plane], man, whoever it was -- that&#39;s just -- that will come. All right? That will all come. Everybody&#39;s going to flip. That&#39;s the way it is now. That sells papers now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Yes, sadly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: For ten minutes let&#39;s celebrate. Yes, please.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Well said, Liza.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MINNELLI: [To defense attorney Mark Geragos] Thank you for getting him released. Thank you for getting him off. He was not guilty, folks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.today.com/popculture/liza-minnelli-dedicates-song-jackson-wbna32634605"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Today&rdquo; (August 30, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191210231448/https://www.today.com/popculture/liza-minnelli-dedicates-song-jackson-wbna32634605"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was a wonderful guy.
