She showed up to find no band, just a video camera. She played funky rhythms, followed by her solo arrangement of John Coltrane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Giant Steps,&rdquo; a product of her years of jazz training. Then she tapped out the monstrous solo for &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; originally recorded by Eddie Van Halen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few days went by. Batten was asked to rehearse again, this time with a band. It seemed to go well, but still she heard no final verdict. After even more rehearsals, she was given a passport, a plane ticket to Tokyo, and a makeover that traded her brown hair and glasses for an electric mohawk and heavy makeup. After her arrival, as a gesture of goodwill, Jackson closed Tokyo Disneyland to the public and let his 100-person entourage enjoy themselves without crowds or nagging fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten was frolicking in the Disneyland gift shop with Sheryl Crow, then a background singer on the tour, when she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to find the King of Pop standing there. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I like how you&rsquo;re playing the &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; solo,&rsquo;&rdquo; she remembers. &ldquo;And I thought, &lsquo;Wow, what a great surprise and a validation.&rsquo; That was when I knew I had the gig.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://historycontinues.com/testvb/showthread.php?1430-The-Strathpeffer-(Scotland)-interview-with-Jennifer-Batten-2010"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Maximum Jackson&rdquo; (February 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200219155717/http://historycontinues.com/testvb/showthread.php?1430-The-Strathpeffer-(Scotland)-interview-with-Jennifer-Batten-2010"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: You&rsquo;ve made 3 solo albums of your own. Did MJ hear any of your music?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jennifer Batten: I think I gave him both records, cos the second one was released just before the History tour. So his reaction was, I have to sing! He said, &quot;If you wanna be famous you&rsquo;ve gotta sing!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Have you seen Michael Jackson&rsquo;s This Is It?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Yeah, I&rsquo;ve seen it twice. I loved it! I hadn&rsquo;t played with him for 12 years. It just brought back the memory of his talent, in every way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: What you saw in the This Is It rehearsals, is that how you remember Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Yeah! It was wonderful the way he moved his body. His voice was in wonderful shape and a lot of people felt really sad watching that. But I just soaked it in, with good memories.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: When I first heard the band members had been selected for This Is It, I was surprised to see your name wasn&#39;t there. Were you asked to be a part of it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: No, he wanted to get new faces in, young players and dancers. And a new face on guitar, which is fine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Do you know Orianthi?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Yeah, yeah, we&rsquo;re e-mail buddies. She&rsquo;s got a skyrocketing career just now, she&rsquo;s doing great and she plays all over the world. It was a good move on his part [getting Orianthi on guitar].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Which was your favorite Michael Jackson tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Bad, definitely. It was energetic and new for everybody. I still stay in touch with some of the band members, they&rsquo;re great people. Ricky Lawson the drummer, and Greg Phillinganes I see every couple of years. Michael&rsquo;s hairdresser, I stay in touch with her all the time. The Bad tour had the best energy, things shifted a little with the Dangerous tour when he started cancelling dates. My focus was a little different, I was taking the opportunity to promote my record in every city on Dangerous and History. So I was really busy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Was MJ specifically looking for a lead female musician for his tours?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: I don&rsquo;t know, I never heard. I didn&rsquo;t see who else auditioned. I had no idea how many men and women came to audition for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Which MJ song was your favorite to play on tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Human Nature. Yeah, and that was my favorite on the This Is It movie too. It was beautiful, the way he sang it. I remember the lighting of it, live, was just spectacular.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: You&rsquo;re writing a book about touring with Michael Jackson. How is that coming along?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: I&rsquo;ve got 3 or 4 chapters done. My sister is a book editor! But I&rsquo;ve been so busy, I haven&rsquo;t touched it in months. I&rsquo;m taking my time with that, when I go home I&rsquo;m gonna go back and look at all the films. I&rsquo;ve got 20 hours of film from the tour, so I need to stir up the memories again. But it&rsquo;s in the works. I got turned down by all the major publishers because there&rsquo;s gonna be no gossip in the book!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Were you ever asked to work on any of Michael&rsquo;s studio albums?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: He had guys like Slash and Steve Stevens, high profile. Those guys were the top of the game. I&rsquo;ve got no complaints, I did get to play onstage with him for 10 years!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: Somebody we know wanted us to ask you if you have ever met Prince.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t actually officially meet him. He came backstage at one of the Jackson shows on the Bad tour, he had Sheila E and Cat with him. I had some friends who were sitting behind him at the show, they said he went nuts when I did my solo on Beat It! [chuckles] But I never met him personally.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: ...When was the last time you spoke to Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: The last date of the HIStory Tour. About 12 years ago!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;: So you pretty much had a strictly professional relationship with Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: Yeah. We worked with each other for 10 years and it was during the tours. During rehearsals we could have access to him, but once we were on the road&hellip;we would have a group prayer before every show and he was gone before we even left the venue. There were 100 people in the entourage and we took up 3 hotels. A couple of times we&rsquo;d stay in his hotel, but not often. But being on the road with him was fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[We give her a picture from the History tour to sign, and she chuckles at the large wig covering her face in the picture.]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Batten: I had a couple of those wigs. I thought it was such a dreadful look. I don&rsquo;t think about that too much! The original picture it came from was pretty cool, but once it all came to life&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t so cool any more! But Michael always wanted to shock people.</span></p></body>
