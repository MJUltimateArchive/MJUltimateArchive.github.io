And he said, &quot;I got a text message that Michael died.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I said, it must be a mistake or something. So he called the lady who rang him. And he said, it&#39;s true. And then, of course, Otis just broke down. So that was the end of the meeting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What was he like to manage? BERGER: Well, I managed—I was their first manager when they joined Motown. It&#39;s interesting, because I only managed people that Barry Gordy was personally interested in. So I managed Smokey. I managed the Supremes. I managed the Temptations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And one night I was getting off the road with the Supremes, and I got a telephone call from Barry Gordy and he said, &quot;We just signed this new group and you&#39;re going to manage them.&quot; He said, &quot;You have to come down to the studio right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;Why do I have to come down to the studio? You tell me I&#39;m managing them, I&#39;m managing them. I know what I have to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, no, no, no. You have to come down to the studio.&quot; OK. So I go down to the studio on Fairfax Avenue. There&#39;s five little kids. And he says, &quot;This is Shelley Berger. He manages Diane Ross. He manages Smokey Robinson. He manages Temptations. Now he&#39;s your manager. Show them what you can do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael just went into this James Brown thing. And I almost fell on the floor and I said, &quot;Sammy Davis has been reincarnated.&quot; You know? It was the same kind of electricity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Wow, how long were you with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: I was with him only for about a year and a half.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Those were good times, then? Easy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: Well, we just created something because Mr. Gordy, who, you know...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Berry&#39;s a genius.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: He said to me, can we—we were doing meetings and the agency, like, oh, we&#39;re going to get him on the Joey Bishop Show. We&#39;re going to get him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the meeting Mr. Gordy said to me, &quot;What do you think?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I said, &quot;Let me ask you a question. Do you think you can get three No. 1 records on the Jackson 5?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, only Barry Gordy can say this. He says, &quot;I already have it in the can.&quot; And I believed it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I said, &quot;OK, if you can get three No. 1 records in a row, we will not put the Jacksons out until they&#39;re getting $25,000 a night.&quot; Now, understand this is 1968. So $25—I mean, that was top dollar. The Beatles got...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You got it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: No, we didn&#39;t get it. First record came out. It was $5,000, $5,000, $7,500. Second record came out. It was $10,000, $12,005. And you could do this, you see, because it was the driven snow. There was no price on the Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What was the third?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: The third record comes up. Now, it&#39;s up to $17,000, $17,500. Now my reputation is on the line, because I told Barry Gordy I&#39;d get $25,000.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I went to a good, corrupt general manager of the forum. Because that was the time...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: What did he do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BERGER: I said, I will give you—I will promote the concert. I will give you all the promoter&#39;s money for the concert, but you have to give me two contracts for $25,000: one for Oakland, one for L.A.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;They&#39;re going to make more than $25,000. We&#39;ll sell the shows out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he said, &quot;OK.&quot; He said, but let me ask you a question. Mr. Cooke owned the Lakers at the time. And he said, he&#39;s having a problem renegotiating Elgin Baylor&#39;s contract. Do you think Elgin Baylor can be listed as the promoter?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;You&#39;ve got it.&quot; I had the Jackson 5 do a thing with Elgin Baylor, and of course. </span></p></body>
