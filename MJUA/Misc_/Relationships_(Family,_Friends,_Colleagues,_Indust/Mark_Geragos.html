How are you reacting to all of this, Mark?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARK GERAGOS, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I think like anybody else. Everybody who knows Michael is shocked. There&#39;s dismay. I guess the good part of it is that finally people are starting to recognize, I think, and focusing on all his genius, as opposed to all the supposed peccadilloes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: As a client, we discussed this; in the middle of the trial he was dancing on SUVs. Was that troublesome?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GERAGOS: I&#39;ll never forget that day. I remember Ben Brafman was on one side of me and Pat Harris was on the other. Whatever anybody says about Michael, it takes a heck of an athlete to make that jump from the ground up to the top of the SUV. And I was using a few choice words about getting him back down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But he knew what he was doing, and after that I ran into the judge. He had a sense of humor about it. It was not --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You were bugged and he was bugged when he was secretly taped on that plane?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GERAGOS: We were more than bugged. I probably -- professionally, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been angrier than sitting on that plane with somebody. I don&#39;t care who you are. You&#39;re going to surrender. You have the whole world focused on you. To have some low life install a recording device when you&#39;re with your lawyer, going to turn yourself in on something that is completely unfounded, to listen to what you&#39;re talking to your lawyer about, and then trying to market it, and sell it for millions of dollars, I thought was unconscionable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We did get the last laugh on that, though.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...KING: What was he like as a client?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GERAGOS: He was a good client, actually. I didn&#39;t have any problem with him at all. We represented him for about 18 months. The last, I don&#39;t know, four months I did it in conjunction with Ben. And he was worried, obviously. The first 12 or 13 months before anything was filed, he was, as hands off as one could be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: But he was a good client.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GERAGOS: Absolutely never had any problems.</span></p></body>
