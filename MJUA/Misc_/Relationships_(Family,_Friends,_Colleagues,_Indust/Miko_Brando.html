I mean, they say heart attack, so I have to go with that right now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: We&#39;re not going to know. Now you were with him Wednesday and in the early hours of Thursday. He died on Thursday. You were with him on the early hours of Thursday as he was rehearsing. How was he?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: We were -- yes, we were at Staples Center rehearsing and -- until about midnight or 12:30 that night. And he was fine. He was dancing. He was singing. He was looking over some technical stuff, some videos that he was preparing to do for the flat screen and behind the stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I saw him eating. He was eating. He was drinking some orange juice. He had some hot tea. He looked fine. We said hi to each other.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Was he in a good mood?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Yes, absolutely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: And no apparent difficulty? No lack of color in the face? At times it&#39;s hard to (INAUDIBLE) gray or something like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: No. No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Dr. Conrad Murray, who was at his home yesterday, do you how him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: So you never heard of him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: I know of him, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You were with the family last night, too, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Like you were with the children. How are they coping?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: I don&#39;t even know if they&#39;re -- they&#39;re devastated. I mean...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Do the kids have an understanding of what happened?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hit them yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: How did you meet Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Met Michael through Quincy Jones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Tell me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Back in &#39;83? No, yes, &#39;83. Yes. He was -- Michael -- CBS Records at the time was giving Michael all his &quot;Thriller&quot; awards. And I met him down there at a CBS function in San Diego. And he introduced me to him. And we exchanged phone numbers and we were friends ever since.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Hit it off right away?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Hit it off right away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: This was before your father knew him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Right after, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Your father got along with him real well?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Best friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Explain that friendship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: I wish I could. I wish I could. They were so opposite. You know, one -- yes, they were so opposite of each other but they love each other. They were fond of each other. They loved each other. Michael really looked after my father really well the last few years of his life. And there&#39;s nothing that neither one would do for each other.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: I know your father told me that he just flipped for Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Anything Michael wanted, you know, acting lessons, this and that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You were with -- you were there when Michael&#39;s hair caught on fire, right, during that Pepsi commercial?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Yes, I put it out. Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: You put the fire out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: I put the fire out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: How close were you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Right on him. I was right on him. I smothered his hair and we both went down to the floor. And we both got the extinguisher on us. The fire extinguisher on us. And that was the -- yes, that was the Pepsi commercial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: And Michael said to the very end he was always in debt to you, that you saved his life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Nothing I wouldn&#39;t do for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: I spoke about you with Michael with my -- last time I was with him in 2007. The Jesse Jackson dinner. And he held you in nothing but the highest regard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...What kind of friend was Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: He was the best friend. Always there for me. Caring, loving, he was just a good person, always there for you if you needed him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Godfather to your...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Godfather to my daughter. Always there for her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: How old is she now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: She&#39;ll be 14.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: How&#39;s she taking it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: It was hard to tell her because we were going on this tour, and I told them that she was going with me. For the summer. He goes, that would be great. Maybe we can find something for her to do on the tour. And he was...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Yes. You were going to go with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...KING: Miko, it&#39;s fair to ask, were you worried about Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: Yes, I was worried about him. But at the end, he was fine. He was eating properly. He was working out. Up there on stage, rehearsing. He was -- he hit those notes. He hit those steps. He didn&#39;t miss a step.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I mean, he looked good. He looked -- he was ready to go.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://larrykinglive.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/29/lkl-web-exclusive-michael-jacksons-friend-and-marlon-brandos-son-on-the-michael-jackson-he-knew/"><span class="cs8567212B">Larry King Live Blogs (June 29, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was my idol. &nbsp;He&#39;s been my father figure since my father died. &nbsp;It&#39;s strange living without him. &nbsp;I will never be the same, and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever get over this loss. &nbsp;It&#39;s like losing your companion, someone you always thought would be there. &nbsp;It&#39;s just not right. &nbsp;He meant a lot to me. &nbsp;I feel like a different person than I was before Thursday. &nbsp;I feel numb - lost. &nbsp;He was a good friend for so many years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I treasure the time I spent with Michael. &nbsp;We&#39;d go shopping together, go to Disneyland, take trips, spend time at Dad&#39;s house. &nbsp;He&#39;d just come over and set up camp at my dad&#39;s house for a while. &nbsp;I enjoyed talking about music, eating together and having fun with Michael. &nbsp;We were just good friends, that&#39;s the best way I can put it. &nbsp;He was always there for me when I needed him, and I&#39;d like to think I was always there for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t really have a single memory of Michael that sticks out. &nbsp;It&#39;s hard to do when you&#39;ve been friends as long as we have. &nbsp;My best memories are of the time we spent talking, him hugging me, having good conversations, and making him laugh - I really enjoyed making him laugh. &nbsp;I could say some things - just a few words in his ear, and I could get a laugh out of him. &nbsp;And boy, did he have an infectious laugh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Above all, Michael was a very caring person. &nbsp;He had a lot of love in his heart. &nbsp;He cared about everybody, especially the people on the street. &nbsp;He wasn&#39;t stuck up - he had no ego, and he tried to make time for everybody because he didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings. &nbsp;If he thought he did something wrong, it would really bother him. &nbsp;He had more love than anyone I know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Michael I saw everyday was one that loved his kids. &nbsp;They were his main focus. &nbsp;He was a very busy man, but he always made sure the kids were being looked after.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What a lot of people may not realize about Michael, is how good a businessman he was. &nbsp;The tour he was planning is a perfect example. &nbsp;He was a perfectionist, and he knew exactly what he wanted and how to get it. &nbsp;Everything regarding the tour had to be approved by Michael. &nbsp;Just because he hasn&#39;t been on TV or out in public a lot recently, &nbsp;that doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t busy and active. &nbsp;A lot of people have speculated he was really stressed over the tour, but I don&#39;t think he was. &nbsp;He went through the same routines he did for past tours.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;ve thought about whether there were any similarities between Michael and my dad, and I cannot think of a single one. &nbsp;You&#39;ve heard opposites attract? &nbsp;I think that explains their friendship. &nbsp;They had absolutely nothing in common, but when you got them together, you couldn&#39;t tear them apart. &nbsp;He loved my dad, and they spent many days together at Dad&#39;s house and at Neverland. &nbsp;They were very close.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was instrumental helping my father through the last few years of his life. &nbsp;For that I will always be indebted to him. &nbsp;Dad had a hard time breathing in his final days, and he was on oxygen much of the time. &nbsp;He loved the outdoors, so Michael would invite him over to Neverland. &nbsp;Dad could name all the trees there, and the flowers, but being on oxygen it was hard for him to get around and see them all, it&#39;s such a big place. &nbsp;So Michael got Dad a golf cart with a portable oxygen tank so he could go around and enjoy Neverland. &nbsp;They&#39;d just drive around - Michael Jackson, Marlon Brando, with an oxygen tank in a golf cart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some of the best times I spent with Michael were just sitting on a bench at Disneyland&#39;s &quot;Main Street.&quot; &nbsp;We would just sit there and people watch. &nbsp;Sometimes Michael would be in a getup so people wouldn&#39;t recognize him - but they always did. &nbsp;When he was in a bad mood or a little down, I&#39;d just say &quot;Michael, the bench,&quot; &nbsp;and that would bring him out of it. &nbsp;If I knew he wanted to have fun, or just get away, I&#39;d say &quot;let&#39;s go to the bench,&quot; and we were gone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of course, Michael Jackson in a public place like Disneyland was bound to draw crowds, and sometimes we would have park security with us. &nbsp;But they weren&#39;t there to protect Michael, they were there to protect the crowds. &nbsp;He was never really concerned about himself, but that someone would get hurt in the crush of people that wanted to see him. &nbsp;People would just go crazy when they saw Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael rarely cried, but I think he&#39;d be in tears over the reaction to his death. &nbsp;He&#39;d be overwhelmed and happy that so much of the love he gave was returned by the people he loved. &nbsp;I think he&#39;d take a deep breath and just say thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The family is still planning the funeral, but I think Michael would want it to be a celebration. &nbsp;He would want everybody there. &nbsp;He loved his fans. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been around plenty of big movie stars, but Michael&#39;s fans are beyond fans. &nbsp;He knew the fans were what made him, and he wouldn&#39;t want to leave anyone out. &nbsp;Everywhere he went, fans would be there. &nbsp;He&#39;d tell me the fans always knew what he was doing. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think anyone has ever had fans like that. &nbsp;So Michael would want a funeral that included his fans and made them happy. &nbsp;He would want it to say: &quot;I&#39;m still with you and we&#39;ll always be together.&quot; &nbsp;He was happy, and he wanted to make everybody around him happy. &nbsp;Finally, he would want love. &nbsp;Above all, Michael was about love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57af39232994ca2ad3333c33/t/5a7dfa91c83025378b551746/1518205587140/Miko+Brando+PDF.pdf"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Sun Media&quot;

Jackson called to Brando before leaving for his house in Bel-Air.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He did his full routine with his dancers,&rdquo; Brando remembered. &ldquo;At age 50, he hadn&rsquo;t lost a move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That even includes his world-famous moonwalk.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He could still do it perfectly,&rdquo; 48-year-old Brando said in Hollywood.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was smiling, he looked good. I saw him eat, drink some orange juice and some tea. Obviously, I couldn&rsquo;t see what was going on in his heart.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&rsquo;s no doubt Brando has been hit hard by the news of Jackson&rsquo;s death.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s Michael,&rdquo; he said when his phone rang during the interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando lives at the end of the street where Jackson died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was at home and my phone started ringing nonstop. I turned on the TV and my world collapsed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He doesn&rsquo;t know what killed the music legend. He said he never saw Jackson take any medication. The entertainer did, however, suffer from the Alpha 1 lung disorder, although Brando said that&rsquo;s not why Jackson was often seen wearing a mask in public.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He felt comfortable like that,&rdquo; he said after a long pause. &ldquo;For him it was like wearing a hat or a scarf, it was his thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As for the funeral arrangements, Brando said the Jackson family is talking about having a big ceremony at the Coliseum, Los Angeles&rsquo; 90,000-seat football stadium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando first met Jackson in 1982 when he was 22 and the pop star was 24 years old.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Quincy Jones introduced us at the Del Coronado hotel in San Diego,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We got along right away and he asked me for my number and we started talking every day. In 1984, when he left on the Victory Tour, he asked me to follow along.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando became Jackson&rsquo;s right-hand man, his assistant, his confidante, his bodyguard and his chauffeur.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Was he worried recently about certain people in the entourage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No. I heard about that Dr. (Conrad) Murray, but I never saw him. He was never at the rehearsals at the Staples Center. He was new in the Jackson circle and, God knows, I&rsquo;ve seen doctors come and go,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With photos surfacing recently of Jackson in a wheelchair, there were doubts that the 50-year-old star could deliver the 50 concert dates planned for this summer. There was also talk that he weighed a mere 112 pounds and had gone bald.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He weighed a bit more than that, but Michael was always thin and he still had his hair,&rdquo; Brando said. &ldquo;The wheelchair is from a few months ago. The shows were stretched out over six months, he was going to do it. Of course it was crazy because of the tight schedule. We were going to leave for London this Friday.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson died four years after his trial on charges of molesting a minor, an ordeal he apparently never recovered from.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yes, he thought about it, but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from eating or sleeping,&rdquo; his friend explained. &ldquo;He lived the best he could.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando is also godfather to Jackson&rsquo;s three children and saw them in the past couple of days. &ldquo;They play with their dogs in the yard of the family home. They don&rsquo;t realize what&rsquo;s going on. They aren&rsquo;t showing any emotions yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Miko&rsquo;s own daughter, Prudence, was Jackson&rsquo;s goddaughter. &ldquo;He never forgot my birthday,&rdquo; the 13-year-old remembered. &ldquo;I played a lot with his kids at Neverland and at his house. He just gave me an iPod, a laptop and a scooter at the same time. He told me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just happy to see you!&rsquo; Every Christmas he would bombard us with presents. He always said, &lsquo;I love you.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando was happy to see Jackson&rsquo;s mother, Katherine, get temporary custody of the children. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They know the house; it&rsquo;s where their dad spent his teen years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brando stayed silent on the subject of the father, Joe Jackson, whose bizarre behavior in the media raised more than a few eyebrows in recent days.
