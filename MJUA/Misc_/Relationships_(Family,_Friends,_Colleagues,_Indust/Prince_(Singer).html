According to one observer, it was a strange summit. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so competitive with each other that neither would give anything up. They kind of sat there, checking each other out, but said very little. It was a fascinating stalemate between two very powerful dudes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-musicians-he-was-a-world-icon/49136847/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Star Tribune&rdquo; (June 25, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191012194828/http://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-musicians-he-was-a-world-icon/49136847/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson showed up backstage at a couple Prince shows in 1984. The two icons, whose &quot;Thriller&quot; and &quot;Purple Rain&quot; defined the 1980s, never did work together. Later that decade, when both were recording at the same Los Angeles studio, Prince invited Jackson to play ping-pong. Michael, a star since age 8 who had lived a sheltered life, didn&#39;t know how.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You want me to slam it?&quot; Prince asked, according to engineer David Z, who was there. &quot;Michael drops his paddle and holds his hands up in front of his face so the ball won&#39;t hit him. Michael walks out with his bodyguard, and Prince starts strutting around like a rooster. &#39;Did you see that? He played like Helen Keller.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Bland insists the two icons got along fine: &quot;They&#39;d shoot hoops at Paisley Park,&quot; Prince&#39;s studio/home in Chanhassen. &quot;We used to get packages from MJJ Productions [with] footage of Sly Stone performing in Europe. Prince would pop it in the VCR, and we&#39;d watch it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jennifer Batten, Michael&rsquo;s tour guitarist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://historycontinues.com/testvb/showthread.php?1430-The-Strathpeffer-(Scotland)-interview-with-Jennifer-Batten-2010"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Maximum Jackson&rdquo; (February 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200219155717/http://historycontinues.com/testvb/showthread.php?1430-The-Strathpeffer-(Scotland)-interview-with-Jennifer-Batten-2010"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&quot;Maximum Jackson&quot;:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Somebody we know wanted us to ask you if you have ever met Prince.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jennifer Batten: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I didn&rsquo;t actually officially meet him.

And that&rsquo;s how he was introduced to Prince. After that, I started to let Michael listen to some of the Prince music I had and he was intrigued. At that point, I realized that there was somewhat of a rivalry developing. Michael had been in the business longer, so naturally he didn&rsquo;t want to get replaced by the newcomer.</span></p></body>
