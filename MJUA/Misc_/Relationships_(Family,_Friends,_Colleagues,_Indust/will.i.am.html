They say, &ldquo;Hey, they want you to fly to New York to do a benefit raising money for kids. You wanna go?&rdquo; F*ck it, let&rsquo;s go. Hey, Michael Jackson wants us to come back. Michael Jackson wants you to give him a beat. Michael Jackson wants to do a feed? Yeah, he wants you to fly to Ireland, be there for a week. That&rsquo;s where I go. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">CRAVEONLINE: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">How was that experience with Michael Jackson? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Will.i.am: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That felt like a dream. You&rsquo;re there in Ireland. It&rsquo;s green hills. It&rsquo;s Michael Jackson. You&rsquo;re in the cottage making beats, dance beats. He&rsquo;s like dancing and sh*t. I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take the horse? Take the horse and pick apples. It&rsquo;s wonderful. We love doing it. The horses love going apple picking.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll f*cking go.&rdquo; I swear to God. I&rsquo;m on a f*cking horse. Michael Jackson&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; The horse is picking apples. I&rsquo;m like picking apples and junk, putting them in a bag. I&rsquo;m like wow, this is like picking apples with Michael Jackson on horseback. Look at that sh*t, right? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">CRAVEONLINE: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Will that be a good comeback? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Will.i.am: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">The dude keeps breaking records. He holds the highest amount of records that you could sell. No one&rsquo;s ever going to sell that amount of records. Why? Because there are no more record stores. So you&rsquo;re never going to beat his records. Never, ever, ever in the history of records in life. Not even you, never. How about that? How about no one&rsquo;s ever going to outsell Michael Jackson at selling records because the record industry is over. Game over. There&rsquo;s no more record stores. With no more record stores there&rsquo;s no more pressing plants. With no more pressing plants, there&rsquo;s no more charts. Now he broke another record. What&rsquo;d he sell? A million tickets? It was like 500,000 in an hour. The thing broke down basically. The dude&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Okay, why don&rsquo;t you just like?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">CRAVEONLINE: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">But can he perform still? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Will.i.am: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">He was in my house. It&rsquo;s one thing you hear rumors, but when the guy&rsquo;s in your house, laying on your floor as you&rsquo;re playing beats. He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Will.i.am, I love this beat.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s laying and his feet are up on the chair, he&rsquo;s kicking his feet. I&rsquo;m like dude, Michael Jackson&rsquo;s laying on my floor. Michael Jackson&rsquo;s laying on my floor. He&rsquo;s testing his voice and three hours has passed. He&rsquo;s just mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi, mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi. He&rsquo;s doing both voice testing just to sing for five minutes. He&rsquo;s testing his voice for three hours to sing for five minutes. I don&#39;t know. Fergie don&rsquo;t do that sh*t. Usher don&rsquo;t do that sh*t. None of the people that you think still got it do that. I&rsquo;ve seen it, in my house. </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">CRAVEONLINE: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Is that because he&rsquo;s more fragile? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Will.i.am: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">No, that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s a perfectionist and he just likes testing his voice. &ldquo;I just love, you know, this is all we have is flesh and bones. That&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s just flesh. That&rsquo;s all we got. I want to protect it and take care of it, because this is my voice. This is my thing.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m like dude, can we record now? Because it&rsquo;s three hours, and it&rsquo;s only going take five minutes. &ldquo;No, I just want to warm it up.&rdquo; Like dude, that&rsquo;s hot. It&rsquo;s warmed up. But I don&#39;t know what he&rsquo;s going to use from what we&rsquo;ve done, but I have memories, the stuff I did on Thriller 25 is up. If he uses any of the original things that we&rsquo;ve done, great. If he didn&rsquo;t, I have my memories and the things that we&rsquo;ve done is awesome. I learned so much from the dude. He&rsquo;s cool. And he has it. I&rsquo;ve seen it. He mi mi mi&rsquo;d for three hours. Perfect pitch.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">CRAVEONLINE: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Will you be there at the concert? </span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Will.i.am: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t know but I know that one time I was in Vegas and he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh, I heard you&rsquo;re in Vegas.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;Yeah, we have a show tonight. Can you come?&rdquo; &ldquo;What time you guys go on?&rdquo; We go on at 9 o&rsquo;clock. I swear to God, &ldquo;Oh, rats.&rdquo; He said rats. &ldquo;Oh, rats, I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve got to put the kids to sleep.&rdquo; All right, well after we perform with the Peas, I&rsquo;m performing with Prince. You should come to the show. So Prince invited me to perform with him at the Palms. Maybe you can come see me perform with Prince. So Michael Jackson says, &ldquo;Oh really? I&rsquo;d love to. Call Prince and see if it&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; I call Prince&rsquo;s assistant. She&rsquo;s like sure. So I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Yo, Mike, it&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; Come on, dude. This sh*t ain&rsquo;t real. To me, that that happened, it sounds like a big ass lie, right? Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just call Prince and then bring Michael Jackson but it&rsquo;s the realest sh*t. So, I&rsquo;m late. I&rsquo;m late. I&rsquo;m in the cab, like aw, man, what a time to be f*ckin&rsquo; late. I&rsquo;m always late and I&rsquo;m late for Michael Jackson to see me perform with Prince. So I hop off the cab and I&rsquo;m running in Las Vegas. I&rsquo;m running and people are like, &ldquo;Wyclef!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like f*ck you, right? Then I run and I get to the place and I perform for Prince and I walk off stage and Michael&rsquo;s there. He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;That was awesome.&rdquo; Mind you, we were already in Ireland. He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;That was awesome. I didn&rsquo;t know you rapped.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t know I rap? I&rsquo;m in the Black Eyed Peas.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was you that was the rapper. I thought it was the other guy.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s me, dude.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awesome, that was awesome. We need to do something like that on my record where you rap and I sing.&rdquo; Yeah, but that was a great experience to have Mike see me perform with Prince. It was nuts. That&rsquo;s great, cool.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/795ilavW0L8"><span class="cs8567212B">Ellen interview (April 27, 2016)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ellen: Michael Jackson and Prince did not get along which I did not know that, but you took Michael to see Prince or you took Prince to see Michael, which was it?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">will.i.am: So one time, Black Eyed Peas had a show in Vegas, and we got to Vegas and I get a phone call from Michael, and he says, &quot;It&#39;s Michael, and I heard you guys are performing tonight.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah we go on at 9 PM.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Oh rats, I got to put the kids to sleep.&quot; &quot;Well, later on, I&#39;m performing with Prince, I&#39;m probably going to do this little number with Prince at the Rio&quot;, and he said, &quot;I&#39;d love to do that, but I don&#39;t know if I can do that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot; He was like, &quot;Oh, I dunno, Prince and I always have been at odds with each other.&quot; I was like, &quot;Oh no, let me call him on the phone and I&#39;ll call you right back. I think everything will be great.&quot; So I hang up the phone, call this lady named Ruth, who then would put me in contact with Prince. I was saying, &quot;Michael Jackson wants to come to the show, can you put him in a VIP section where no one knows he&#39;s there?&quot; So Prince said, &quot;Oh yeah, we can arrange that.&quot; So I get off the phone, called Michael Jackson and said, &quot;It&#39;s set, everything&#39;s gonna be great.&quot; We walk him to the VIP room. We get off the stage, [goes to] sit down with me, Prince and his manager, and Chris Tucker. So then Prince is playing the bass, walks off the stage, walks to our area, our section where Michael Jackson&#39;s at. Now say, for example, you (Ellen) are Michael Jackson, I&#39;m Prince. [Proceeds to imitate playing bass in Ellen&#39;s face] And goes off to the stage, right? And so Michael Jackson&#39;s like, &quot;What&#39;s up with Prince playing the bass in my face?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/ptx83x_Jwxo"><span class="cs8567212B">Graham Norton Show (May 13, 2016)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Graham Norton: You brought Michael Jackson and Prince together?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">will.i.am: Yeah, so one time we had a show &nbsp;in Vegas and Michael Jackson called. &quot;Hey it&#39;s Michael.

It was me, Chris Tucker, Michael Jackson watching Prince rock on stage. So, to make a long story short, Prince steps off the stage and plays the bass in Michael Jackson&#39;s face, rips the freaking bass, ten different pieces. To make a longer story shorter, Michael Jackson leaves and goes home and says, &quot;Meet me in the house for breakfast.&quot; So I go to his house for breakfast, knock on the door, first words, he says, &quot;Why was Prince playing the bass in my face?&quot; &quot;Oh, Prince, he&#39;s just being nice&quot; &quot;No, Prince, he&#39;s always been a meanie.&quot; But, bless their hearts, they were so passionate and we lost a great&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/michael-jacksons-secret-dance-album-403316"><span class="cs8567212B">Mirror article (June 30, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s the record the world longs to hear but it has been kept under lock and key since Michael Jackson&rsquo;s shock death.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now 3am has been given the inside track on Jacko&rsquo;s secret recordings from the last man to work with him: Will.i.am.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">e caught up with the Black Eyed Peas star, who produced the King of Pop&rsquo;s long-awaited new album, in the backstage VIP area at Glastonbury.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we couldn&rsquo;t believe our ears as he told us of their plans for Michael&rsquo;s comeback and new sound.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said: &ldquo;It was going to be out of this world.

When you&#39;re in the ghetto surrounded by crime and violence... it... you gave me escape. I escaped from all the drama around me, listening to your music. Thank you, Michael Jackson. Thank you for your dedication, thank you for your music, thank you for the dreams. I used to dance wanted to dance like you. I used to draw pictures of you. Thank you for letting me work with you. Thank you for reaching out, and trying to teach me things about the music industry, and how cool people can be but at the end of the day, lovin&#39; and appreciatin&#39; the craft, and appreciating the fans. Thank you for flying me to Ireland, to work with you. Thank you for coming to the show and talking to me on the telephone, and answering phone calls, and callin&#39; me up on Father&#39;s Day, knowing that I don&#39;t have a dad. Thank you so much. Thank you for being a friend, you didn&#39;t have to wanna know me, but you got to know me. Thank you. We have all lost a great artist-a light to the world, a true talent. I will always remember you. You&#39;re one of the most strongest people I&#39;ve ever met. You&#39;ve undergone so much scrutiny, so much criticism, from either wicked journalists who have nothin&#39; better to but criticize. You have seen the music industry rise and fall. You were not just the King of Pop; you were the King of the Industry. You were the King of the Music Industry. There will never be an artist that would impact the world the way you have; there will never be an artist who sells as many records as you; never. There&#39;re no record stores, how could there be?
