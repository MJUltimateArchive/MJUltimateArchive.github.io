Elton had known him since Jackson was 13. &#39;He used to come to my shows with Elizabeth Taylor.&rsquo; In 1993, having cancelled a tour in the Far East, Jackson was in London undergoing treatment for his addiction to the painkiller Demerol. Elton had only recently met Furnish.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;David was coming down to meet my mother, and he was frightened about that,&rsquo; Elton says. &#39;He arrived at 10 in the morning, and there was a message on my answerphone from my counsellor of the time saying, &ldquo;Oh, by the way, I&rsquo;m bringing Michael Jackson down to lunch.&rdquo; And David was saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t meet your mother and f***ing Michael Jackson in one day.&rdquo; &rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, Elton says, was &#39;charming, sweet, lovely &ndash; but damaged. He came down here and we closed all the curtains and had lunch. He said it was the first time he&rsquo;d sat down and had a meal with people for 10 years. He would always eat on his own.&rsquo; Fame, Elton says, infantilizes people. &#39;You don&rsquo;t ever grow up. But thank God, I did.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was a time, he says, when he would judge himself by his chart positions. &#39;But I&rsquo;m intelligent enough to have got over that now. I remember talking to Michael once when he did Thriller and I said, &ldquo;How are you going to top that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh, the next one&rsquo;s going to do twice as much&rdquo;, and I thought, Michael, it&rsquo;s not. You can&rsquo;t. You put so much pressure on yourself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;It&rsquo;s very clear to me now. I don&rsquo;t have to compete in the charts. I can just be myself as a musician, a songwriter and play with the musicians that I really love. I just feel comfortable in my own skin as an artist &ndash; maybe for the first time in my life. That&rsquo;s weird isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</span></p></body>
