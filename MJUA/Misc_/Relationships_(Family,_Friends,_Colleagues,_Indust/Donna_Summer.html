What are your thoughts, Donna?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SUMMER: Well, I have just -- I have to go on stage and sing tonight. It is extremely difficult. It is such an incredible shock to me. I -- you know, I&#39;ve known Michael for many years. We&#39;ve worked together. We&#39;ve had -- we&#39;ve done different things together over the years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I know his family. And it&#39;s just -- it&#39;s a total shock. And I don&#39;t even have words to say. I mean, I&#39;ll miss Michael. The world will miss Michael. And I&#39;m sure that the world is in a state of grief right now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Where are you performing tonight?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SUMMER: I&#39;m up north of Los Angeles at a casino, Chumash.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Will you talk about him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SUMMER: I certainly will. We&#39;re going to try to dedicate a song to him tonight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: All right. Donna, what was his greatness?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SUMMER: His greatness was perfection. And when you meet people like that, who are so given to doing things at the utmost and the highest level, then it makes you up your game. And Michael was one of those people who wouldn&#39;t stop until he was perfect. And he kept going even after that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I will personally miss him. I will miss his light. I will miss his star. I will miss who he has caused other people to become because of his greatness. He upped -- he upped the standard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Did you let the stories about his personal life affect your feelings about him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SUMMER: Not at all. Not at all. Because I don&#39;t, personally, know that those stories are true. I tend to want to not believe them because I know Michael, and I can&#39;t even imagine that he would ever try to hurt a child. I think it -- I felt more like it was exploitation, personally, from other people. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not. I just -- you know, I just think he was a sitting duck at times.</span></p></body>
