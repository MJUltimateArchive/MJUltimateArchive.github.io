They have been very good to me and I can never forget that. I have learned a lot from Michael, especially. He has taught me to look beyond the outer limits of an issue. That, too, is important.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...How do the Jacksons view themselves?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: Well, they consider themselves average. There is very little egotism in evidence. Philosophically, they are aware of their blackness as being something they are proud of, yet cautious of. They realize the place they hold in the eye of the public and use their influence in quiet, unobtrusive ways. Their message is their music. Michael calls it, &quot;our love and peace and feel good statement.&quot;</span></p></body>
