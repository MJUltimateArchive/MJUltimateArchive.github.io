Michael, when you left us, a part of me went with you and a part of you will live forever within me but also a part of you will live forever within all of us. Michael, I will treasure the good times, the fun we had singing, dancing, and laughing. I can remember when we used to come home from school and we would grab a quick bite to eat and we&rsquo;d try to watch &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; as much of it as possible before mother will come in and say it&rsquo;s time to go to the recording studio. I also Michael remember a time when I went in the record store and there was this man purchasing a lot of CD&rsquo;s. And he would go and grab another batch of CD&rsquo;s. He was an older gentleman, he had short afro, buck crooked teeth, and his clothes were rumpled. I walked up behind him and said: &quot;Michael, what are you doing in this store?&quot; He turned to me and said: &quot;Marlon, how did you know it was me?&quot; I told him: &quot;You&rsquo;re my brother. I can spot you anywhere regardless of your make-up. I know your walk, I know your body language and no, shoes did not help&quot; (Michael wore the same shoes wherever we went). But I guess that was his way of trying to experience what we take for granted. We would never, never understand what he endured. Not being able to walk across a street without a crowd gathering around him; being judged, ridiculed, how much pain can one take? Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone. Michael was the voice of our angelic trumpets, and he would continue to be the voice, that angelic voice, in Heaven, nearest to our Creator, and waiting us when our day comes to pass. Michael, I love you, I will miss when we said our good-bye&rsquo;s. I would hug you and I&rsquo;d say: &quot;I love you&quot; and your response was: &quot;I love you more&quot;. You know, the Lord has a purpose for everything, and sometime we just can&rsquo;t see it or understand it. But it will be made clear to us when we reach that ultimate, ultimate reward of being in His presence. And Michael, you&#39;re There. You&rsquo;re right There. You have finished your work here on Earth, and the Lord has called you to come home with Him. So I thank you, Michael, for all the smiles that you&rsquo;ve placed in many people&rsquo;s hearts. And I thank you for everything that you&rsquo;ve done for others across this globe, in the Lord&rsquo;s name. And I have one request, Michael, one request: I would like for you to give our brother, my twin brother, Brandon, a hug from me. I love you, Michael and I&rsquo;ll miss you.</span></p></body>
