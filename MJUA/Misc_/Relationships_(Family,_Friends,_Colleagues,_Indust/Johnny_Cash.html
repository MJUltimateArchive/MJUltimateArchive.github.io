I get a kick out of meeting an artist I admire. I had always wanted to meet Michael Jackson, just to say I had met him. And I did meet him. June and I had recorded a song called &quot;Jackson&quot;, and I wouldn&#39;t have thought he would have made the connection in a million years, but there&#39;s a line in the song that says, &quot;We got married in a fever / Hotter than a pepper sprout&quot;. I walked up and said, &quot;Hi, Michael. I&#39;m Johnny Cash&quot;, and he said, &quot;Johnny Cash! Hotter than a pepper sprout!&quot;</span></p></body>
