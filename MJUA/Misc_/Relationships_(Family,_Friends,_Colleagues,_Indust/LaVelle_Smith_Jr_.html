Strange times for you it must have been.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Very strange.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Since the death.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Very strange.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I mean, how would you sum up your feelings?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Sadness. Sadness but I do feel really blessed because the happiness that he left with me was all the work we did together. You know? That won&#39;t go away. But the sadness that we don&#39;t get to create anymore with him. That&#39;s sad.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: How do you think, finally, Michael would like to be remembered?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I think he would like to be remembered as someone that was always, you know, making sure that what he delivered to his fans and to his audience was original. It was innovative. And he didn&#39;t mind if people copy it, but he would always wanted to be the one that did it first.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BgfM7IsFBTN/"><span class="cs8567212B">Personal Instagram (December 14, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD855234">Something that really showed me who he was though, on stage once, we were at a dress rehearsal for I think an award show &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure, America or Europe. But I had a costume that&hellip; blew up in the beginning of the number. And unbeknownst to me, I caught on fire! And all the sudden I see Michael running toward me, throws me over, and starts patting the fire out of my back. And I&rsquo;m standing there &ndash;I&rsquo;m laying there actually on the ground smoking &ndash; you know, just fire coming, you know&hellip;smoke coming off of my body.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD855234">He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know you were on fire?&rdquo; 😲</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD855234">I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; 🤔</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD855234">And he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;You were really in the moment!&rdquo; 😅</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD855234">And that was kinda funny to me &ndash; scary, but funny! That showed that, you know as much as he is a true performer, he&rsquo;s human. My friend&rsquo;s on fire, I&rsquo;m gonna put the fire out. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟😄</span></p></body>
