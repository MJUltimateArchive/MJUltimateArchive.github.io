Perhaps that&rsquo;s why it was Michael Jackson&rsquo;s favorite number. It&rsquo;s fitting that Jackson&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">BAD</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album was his seventh studio album, a project which ultimately solidified his megastar power in the &rsquo;80s. This would also be the album to feature the tune &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; one of the few songs Jackson didn&rsquo;t write himself. This would also be the album to feature his first ever duet, &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You.&rdquo; The warm ballad is performed with Siedah Garrett, who also penned &ldquo;Man in the Mirror.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today marks the 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> anniversary of the album </span><span class="cs43C038A">BAD</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and Jackson&rsquo;s musical genius is being commemorated with </span><span class="cs43C038A">BAD 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, a special edition reissue featuring three CDs, two collectible booklets and an authorized DVD of a concert from the BAD Tour. Spike Lee is producing and directing a BAD 25 documentary that is tentatively slated to debut in November on ABC. EBONY recently spoke with Grammy award winning singer and songwriter Garrett about making studio magic with the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: You were instrumental in being a part of this historic album. What kinds of thoughts are going through your mind its re-release?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh my God. Probably just be remembering our gang on tour. You know, me watching him do his thing on stage and then learning of his humanitarian efforts the next day in the newspaper in whatever country we were in. I&rsquo;ll just be remembering my time with him and the process of recording that record. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll go back and check my journal and refresh myself with my thoughts and feelings at the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: How soon after the album was released did the tour take place?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We toured a couple years after the album came out. I was on the Dangerous Tour. It was the tour that followed the BAD Tour. I was rehearsed for [the BAD Tour] for literally a week before I decided that I wanted to make my own record. The duet [&ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You&rdquo;] was out and I knew &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; was forthcoming. So, I backed out of the BAD Tour and enter Sheryl Crow, who replaced me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; is such a passionate and powerful song. I would have sworn that Michael wrote it himself. How did the song come about? I understand that he actually changed some lyrics and wanted some things done differently. Is this true?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, he did not change any lyrics. What happened was I was a songwriter on Quincy Jones&rsquo; publishing company, Qwest, for two and a half years before I gave him the song for Michael. He had a meeting with the songwriters. I think there were about six of us on the West Coast and we all had a meeting at his house where he sort of gave us an outline of what he wanted. To finish this BAD album [Jones] needed one more song to round out the album. I took notes and then I then took my notes to my writing partner Glen Ballard. It was like a Wednesday afternoon where we sat down to start writing. Glen asked me to give him details from the notes. I gave him the parameters and he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just see what we come up with.&rdquo; He gets up. He goes over to his keyboard. He turns on the keyboard and he starts playing this chord progression for the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: I love the song&rsquo;s title, &ldquo;Man in the Mirror.&rdquo; How did that come about and what was Quincy&rsquo;s initial response?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Two years earlier, I&rsquo;m in a songwriting session with my dear friend John Beasley. We&rsquo;re writing and his phone rings. Instead of letting the machine pick it up, he answers the phone and begins this conversation. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not doing nothing. I&rsquo;m just hanging out, you know.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m flipping through my lyric book thinking to myself, &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t say he wasn&rsquo;t doing nothing. No, he didn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s just hanging out.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m thinking to myself that we&rsquo;re writing here. Then I hear him say, &ldquo;The man? What man? Oh, the &lsquo;Man in the Mirror.&rsquo;&rdquo; I wrote down the phrase the man in the mirror. Two years later, I tell him what he said. He gets up and turns on the keyboard and starts playing this chord progression. I was flipping through my lyric book again. The phrase man in the mirror just popped out at me. At that point, I could not write fast enough. Like, I couldn&rsquo;t get it all out quickly enough. I mean, it was just like a mad rush just trickled down the idea and literally 10 or 15 minutes we had the first verse and the first chorus of &ldquo;Man in the Mirror.&rdquo; Glen said, &ldquo;Okay, you go finish the lyrics and I&rsquo;ll finish the music.&rdquo; It was Wednesday. He said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet on Friday and we&rsquo;ll do the demo.&rdquo; So, on Friday, by the time we finished the actual demo, the Qwest Publishing office was closed for the weekend. I could not wait until Monday. I mean, I&rsquo;ve never done this since and I have never done it before. I called Quincy and said, &ldquo;Dude, I have this song that Glen and I wrote for Michael. I think it&rsquo;s a really good song. I would love if you could hear it.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Okay. Just take it to the Qwest Publishing on Monday and I&rsquo;ll hear it and I&rsquo;ll get back to you.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Dude, can we just &mdash; let me just drop it off.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a meeting. I have 12 people here in a meeting. I can&rsquo;t right now.&rdquo; I tell him again,&ldquo;Let me just drop it off.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; Then he hung up. So, I go to Quincy&rsquo;s house and I knock on the door. He comes to the door. He opens the front door and I see a view of the dining room from the front door and there are 12 suits sitting at his dining room table. They&rsquo;re all looking up at me like, &ldquo;This better be good because you&rsquo;re interrupting some big business here. This really better be good.&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;m getting all their vibes, right? Quincy comes to the door and I hand him the cassette. I said, &ldquo;Dude, all I ask is just let me know what you think.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Alright. Alright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: What happened next?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">A couple hours later, the phone rings and Quincy goes, &ldquo;Siedah, this is the best song I&rsquo;ve heard in 10 years.&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;m like grooving. The fact that Quincy&rsquo;s telling me the best song in 10 years. Yes! Then he says, &ldquo;But &mdash; then I hear that Charlie Brown teacher voice, &ldquo;Wha, wha, wha, wha.&rdquo; Because I really don&rsquo;t want to know what is coming after but because I don&rsquo;t really care. I&rsquo;m just bubbling in the best song in 10 years. Let me just live in that for a moment. Then I hear Quincy say something like, &ldquo;Michael has been in the studio with him for two and a half years. He has yet to record a song that he didn&rsquo;t write. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s going to record it.&rdquo; I just had to let it go. I said, &ldquo;Okay. Whatever. Just let it go. I&rsquo;m going to release that.&rdquo; Four or five days later I get a call from Quincy and he&rsquo;s in the studio. He comes on the phone and he says, &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re in the studio recording your old piece of song.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Michael wants the chorus to be twice as long. He really wants you to &mdash; then he says, &ldquo;Hold on a minute.&rdquo; Then I hear [him talking to Michael in the background]. Of course, he said, &ldquo;He really wants you to bring home the idea of &mdash; hold on Siedah.&rdquo; Then I hear [him talking to Michael in the background]. Then Quincy says, &ldquo;Hold on a minute.&rdquo; Quincy Jones puts Michael on the phone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: What was it like talking to him for the first time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Okay, my whole childhood when I was growing up, Michael was my husband. My cousins had Jackie and my sister had Jermaine. We all had the brothers, but Michael was my husband. So, to me, in my little 6-year-old or 13-year-old brain I&rsquo;m talking to my husband. I don&rsquo;t want to get over excited. I don&rsquo;t want to sound too much like a screaming fan. I went strictly into telephone operator [mode]. I said, &ldquo;Hello? How can I help you?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I love your voice. I love the song.&rdquo; Then he starts telling me what he wants the next four lines of lyrics to say. So, the next day I write six different stanzas for him to choose from. What he ended up choosing was, &ldquo;You got to get it right while you got the time. When you close your heart then you close your mind.&rdquo; Those four, that stanza, those four lines were not in the original demo. He asked me to come up with more lines to make the chorus twice as long and I did. The rest, as they say, is history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: That was the beginning of your work relationship with Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SIEDAH GARRETT: Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">EBONY: The demo they heard was actually you singing what he would ultimately record?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That&rsquo;s right. When we recorded the song, my vocal range is a little higher than Michael&rsquo;s range. The song demo was in a key one step higher than he was comfortable singing it. He had me re-sing the demo in the new key. Then doing that he filmed me singing this demo in the new key. I actually said, &ldquo;What are you doing? Why are you filming this?&rdquo; He said to me, &ldquo;Because I want to sing it like you. You sound so great and I want to sing it just like you.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Oh, great, Mike, my friends are really going to believe me when I tell them that Michael Jackson wanted to sing this song just like me.&rdquo; We laughed about that. Actually, Spike [Lee] found that footage and he put it in [his BAD] documentary. I haven&rsquo;t seen it. I can&rsquo;t wait to see it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: When he recorded &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; were you in the studio with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, the whole first two-thirds of the song is just he and I. He&rsquo;s singing lead and I&rsquo;m doing all the harmonies and we&rsquo;re both singing all the background. We&rsquo;re singing all the choruses until the choir comes in. We were the first two-thirds of the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: After hearing your demo for &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; I understand that he loved your voice so much he wanted to do a duet. How did he come to ask you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He didn&rsquo;t ask while I was in the room. We had recorded the &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; with this huge choir and it was just a long, long day of recording. But I wasn&rsquo;t sure that we finished the song. So, Quincy called me back a couple days later. I thought we were going to finish &ldquo;Man in the Mirror.&rdquo; I go in the studio and there&rsquo;s no choir. The song isn&rsquo;t even up yet. There&rsquo;s only four people in the studio. It&rsquo;s me, Quincy, the fabulous engineer, Bruce Swedien, and Michael. This other song was playing. I was behind the console, behind the mixing board sitting, thinking that maybe they&rsquo;re running behind. Maybe I&rsquo;m late. Then Quincy yells back at me, &ldquo;Siedah, you like this song?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Well, can you sing it?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Well, go on in there and sing it. Michael, go on in there with Siedah.&rdquo; So, this moment for me right now is so real. I&rsquo;m walking into the studio and behind me is Michael. I get in the studio and there are two stands with music sheets on each. On the music sheet it says, &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You.&rdquo; Michael. Siedah. Each of us get a verse and a chorus. At that moment, in that instant, I realized, &ldquo;Oh my God, I&rsquo;m going to do a duet with the King of Pop. I can&rsquo;t believe it. I&rsquo;m just busy trying to do the best that I can do so that they would want to keep me on this. I&rsquo;m like seriously trying to sing and watch Michael do his side of the verse. When my verse comes in, I close my eyes and step up to the mic and I start bemoaning these lyrics. I start feeling this stuff flying in my face. Michael is throwing popcorn at me while I&rsquo;m trying my best to do this perfect vocal for him and Quincy. He&rsquo;s cracking up because Quincy&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Siedah, you&rsquo;re wasting studio time. Come on. I don&rsquo;t have time.&rdquo; Quincy just heard that I kept messing up. He didn&rsquo;t know that Michael was throwing stuff at my face. Michael was cracking up. He thought that was the funniest thing while I was getting reprimanded for something that he thought was hilarious. Quincy just thought I was messing up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Aside from his sister Janet, aren&rsquo;t you the only female to ever perform a duet with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Well, darling, I was a question on a game show. [She chuckles] I think it was Jeopardy. The question was, &ldquo;Who is the only person in the world, only female in the world unrelated to Michael Jackson, to ever do a duet with him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Did he ever say why he never recorded a duet with anybody else?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I didn&rsquo;t ask. I didn&rsquo;t care. He was doing a duet with me and that&rsquo;s all I cared about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Is it true that &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You&rdquo; was originally intended for either Barbara Streisand or Whitney Houston?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I heard that. I did talk to Quincy and Mike about that and they told me that, but I didn&rsquo;t care. It wasn&rsquo;t intended for anybody, but me evidently. It makes no difference, because I&rsquo;m the one on it. Even before Barbara said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; even before Whitney says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; it was meant for me just like the BAD Tour was meant for Sheryl. I had to live with that. I had to get with that. Evidently that was not meant for me. The Dangerous Tour was meant for me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: What was his work ethic like on that tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Michael was a constant perfectionist. He loved watching other people do what they did best and then taking that and adding his own little twist to it. He loved to pull the best from the best and make it his own. He loved studying the greats. He felt that they could only add to what he did naturally. He was absolutely right. I mean, he studied James Brown for years when he was 10 years old, because the Jackson 5 would open for James. He studied him. He studied Fred Astaire. He loved to watch Fred&rsquo;s movies. We were in the studio recording some work on &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; or the duet. I can&rsquo;t remember which it was. We did the duet in three languages: English, French and Spanish. So, I spent like a week with him in the studio doing the three songs in different languages. It was just an awesome experience recording with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Michael enjoyed playing jokes. When it came to rehearsing for a tour, was he all fun and games at times?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No. It was no joke. When it came time to rehearse, there was no popcorn throwing at that moment. He was all business.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Michael really loved to laugh. I understand he was quite a practical joker.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He was a joker to his core. He loved a good joke especially if it&rsquo;s displayed on somebody else.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Michael wrote &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You.&rdquo; He wrote most of his own songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He is an underappreciated songwriter and an underappreciated singer. I think the world only gives him the most recognition for his dancing. He was an awesome singer and an amazing songwriter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Did he tell you how he came to write &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No. You know, I never asked. That&rsquo;s a good question. I should have asked him that question. Now we&rsquo;ll never know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Tell me about your new single?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Keep On Loving You.&rdquo; It is an answer to our duet &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You.&rdquo; The new song tells the story of how we met and how I felt meeting him. He really turns my life and changed my creative process as well. It really honors him and honors my relationship with him so much so that the family, the estate and Sony Music gave me permission to use footage from our time on tour together in my new video. I am just so, so honored that they sought to do that because they didn&rsquo;t have to do that at all. It&rsquo;s a brilliant gesture because they realized how much he meant to me. When you hear the song and watch the video, you&rsquo;ll get that too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Did you do this song shortly after he passed or was it something you did recently because of BAD&rsquo;s 25th anniversary?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It took a minute. I think I wrote this song like late last year. I have to live with the idea that he is no more. He lives in my mind and in my heart in a spiritual sense. That takes a little bit of time to get your head around it. I have to really stress out my feelings about his being gone from my life from now on. I guess that took a minute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Where were you when you first heard that Michael passed away?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was in my kitchen making lunch. I happened to be talking to Don Boyette, the bass player that I toured with on the BAD Tour. It was on the news that there was an ambulance that went to Michael&rsquo;s house. Then his wife called and she sounded urgent. So he hung up with me and took the call from his wife. When I hung up the phone, I turned on the radio, turned on the TV and that&rsquo;s when it all kind of hit me. By the time Don called me back, I was a pile of blob on the floor. I was just a mess heaving and crying my heart out. It was so unbelievable. So unbelievable. I was a wreck for a while. It was not good.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Do you listen to the duet anymore? Some artists say, &ldquo;Oh, I never listen to my music.&rdquo; Do you listen to it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I can&rsquo;t help it. I can be driving down the street minding my own business and somebody will pull up next to me and Michael is on the radio. I could be shopping until my heart&rsquo;s content, rolling through a boutique, and he&rsquo;s on the speaker in the store. I can be going to an appointment with my attorney or my dentist in the elevator and his music is in the elevator. He&rsquo;s everywhere. I can&rsquo;t not listen to what we did because it&rsquo;s everywhere. I listen to it all the time whether I want to or not.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: Is it still difficult for you to listen to it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, no, no, no. I cherish that time we had together. It just makes me smile. It makes me happy and sad at the same time. Just sad because I&rsquo;ll never repeat it, but happy that I got to experience it in the first place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: What would people be surprised to find out about him that they might not know or wouldn&rsquo;t think?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Here&rsquo;s the thing. This is what you should take away. Whenever you were in his presence, I mean, he&rsquo;s the King of Pop and the most recognized face on the planet second only to Muhammad Ali. I was often surprised to find out that he felt he had as much to learn from you as you did from him. So he treated you accordingly. Everyone was a teacher to him. He had something to learn from everybody. If he appreciated your creative artistry, he was that much more into you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: So there&rsquo;s the tribute song, &ldquo;Keep On Loving You,&rdquo; to your dear friend. What other things are you doing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">SIEDAH GARRETT:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;m just mostly focused on the re-release of this record and talking about my love for Michael and promoting my single that describes my relationship with him. There&rsquo;s so many good things I have to look forward to in life and new opportunities that arise every day because of my association with him. I mean, he is the gift that keeps on giving.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mjjcommunity.com/the-fan-club/exclusive-q-a/item/187-q-a-with-siedah-garrett"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MJJCommunity&rdquo; interview (2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191009192254/http://www.mjjcommunity.com/the-fan-club/exclusive-q-a/item/187-q-a-with-siedah-garrett"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Were you a Michael Jackson fan before you met him? How did your perception of him changed after you met him / worked with him / toured with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I had been a Jackson 5 fan my entire life. In fact, during my childhood, Michael Jackson was my play husband. I began to love Michael when he became a solo artist, and I really fell in love with him when he decided to record my song. It was then that I realized that he was more socially conscious than anyone had given him credit for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What was your first impression of Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: He was so cool, so unexpectedly approachable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Where did the idea of Man In The Mirror come from?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Two years before I wrote the song, I was in a writing session with composer John Beasley. In the heat of our session, he decided to answer an incoming call, and responded as if he really wasn&rsquo;t busy at all. I was seething. I then heard him say &rdquo;The man? What man? Oh, the man in the mirror.&rdquo; That phrase stuck in my mind, and I wrote it down in my lyric book of random ideas. Two years later, as my new writing partner Glen Ballard was searching for sounds on his synthesizer, I came across the notation in my lyric book, and it just jumped off of the page.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: How long did it take to write &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Literally 15 minutes for the first verse and chorus. It just poured out of me. It was almost like it wrote itself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did you write other songs for Michael that never made it onto his albums?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yes, I wrote a song called &ldquo;Innocent Side&rdquo; that I submitted at the same time as &ldquo;Man In The Mirror&rdquo;, but it was not selected. The only other song that I wrote for MJ was &ldquo;Keep The Faith&rdquo;, which he co-wrote, and which he then recorded on his Dangerous album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Siedah you are great songwriter, can you comment on Michael&#39;s song writing skills. Which song(s) do you consider his best?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Michael was an incredible writer, and I think he was in his songwriting prime when he wrote for &ldquo;Off The Wall&rdquo;. I love everything he wrote for that record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What was it like to work with Michael in the studio?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It was a unique learning experience. Michael was a complete perfectionist, although he would only have to do a few takes, each take was amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What was the best part of being on tour with Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Watching him every night on stage was absolutely amazing. Also being able to see the world at the highest level possible. It was almost like traveling with Jesus.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did you ever see Michael do something that shocked you or took you by surprise either on stage or off stage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yes! Every night! And I often did things that surprised him, like when I put on a blond wig without his knowledge to perform our duet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Was it hard to concentrate on your singing when Michael was rubbing your thigh during I Just Can&#39;t Stop Loving You on the Dangerous tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Wow! The very first time he did it, it took me by surprise. After that, I began to expect it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It has been rumoured that the Dangerous Tour was to continue in the US after the final 1993 dates in Australia. Do you know if there is any truth to this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I really don&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What was it like to hang-out with him, when you guys were not working? Was he a different personality when not on stage or in the recording studio?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Absolutely. He was very serious about his craft, so, when working there were no fun-and-games. However, when not working, he was fun, relaxed, engaging, ridiculously creative, extremely aware of world issues, and a true artist in every sense of the word. He seemed to take to me because I was always myself when around him, never phony or intimidated. He would constantly say to me, &quot;You so crazy!&quot; In fact, he had a pet name for me, Miss Gayrree.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What was your most memorable conversation you ever had with Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: We were in studio recording on the day Fred Astaire passed away. Michael was deeply saddened, and shared with me just how much he loved and was influenced by Fred and his incredible dancing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did Michael ever confide in you when something was troubling him? Did you ever have some real deep serious conversations with him (other than when you were working on songs)?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yes, we talked about the plight of African-Americans in this country, and he surprised me with his knowledge of African-American issues. Also, he once told me that the happiest he ever is in life is when he is on-stage performing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: If you could describe Michael in only one word, what word would that be?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Other-wordly!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: A lot of people have said Michael had a great sense of humour. What are your personal experiences of this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Once, while in the studio recording our duet &quot;I Just Can&#39;t Stop Loving You&quot;, he began tossing popcorn in my face in an effort to make me mess-up. Producer Quincy Jones, not seeing this, began to chastise me for flubbing the takes. Michael, on the other hand, was just CRACKING UP!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Over the years, especially in the 2000s, did you keep in touch with Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No, I hadn&rsquo;t spoken to him in 17 years. I didn&rsquo;t really reach out to him, not until 2009 when I knew he was making plans to go back on tour. I caught up with him on the phone during the Michael Jackson week on American Idol, four weeks before he died. He congratulated me on my Grammy win and Oscar nomination. I later saw him at his tour audition three weeks before he died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Where were you when you first got the news that Michael had passed away? And what was your immediate reaction?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I was home in my kitchen making lunch when I heard the news on the radio. I called a fellow MJ alumnus to question whether it was real or a hoax, but then shortly found out that it was the truth. I was devastated, physically and emotionally.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What would you want Michael fans all over the world to know about him, as someone who knew him personally and professionally?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Michael was genuinely compassionate and caring. I feel that during his lifetime he was under-rated and under-appreciated, and unfortunately ostracized. Thank God he has been exonerated after his death.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJJC</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Is there anything you want to say to the members of MJJCommunity and Michael Jackson fans in general?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I want to say that Michael Jackson fans are the most loyal fans on the entire planet, and he really, really appreciated them, as do I.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://entertainment.inquirer.net/64868/man-in-the-mirror-co-writer-pens-new-tribute-songs-for-mj"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo; (October 27, 2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110756/https://entertainment.inquirer.net/64868/man-in-the-mirror-co-writer-pens-new-tribute-songs-for-mj"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Siedah Garrett, who co-wrote Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; and sang &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You,&rdquo; has composed and performed two new tribute songs to the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We recently met the Grammy winner and Oscar-nominated Siedah through top Fil-Am makeup artist Maxi Tone, at The Mulligan Project fundraising dinner hosted by former Bb. Pilipinas International Lisa Manibog Lew Brennan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a later interview via e-mail, the multitalented Siedah disclosed that she had penned and sang two new songs, &ldquo;Keep on Lovin&rsquo; You&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Remember,&rdquo; as a tribute to the late Michael. Below are excerpts from our interview with Siedah, who remembers Michael fondly for being highly creative, for being a perfectionist and for his childlike sense of humor:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Keep On Lovin&rsquo; You&rdquo; is your answer to your original duet with Michael Jackson. What thoughts and feelings did you have as you were composing and performing the new song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Siedah Garrett: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Whenever we were on stage performing the duet &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You,&rdquo; it was like Michael was singing it to me. So, I wanted to write a response that would describe how I felt about him, what a difference he made in my life, and how much I appreciated the opportunities he afforded me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Will there be other treats for Michael Jackson fans in your coming new album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Garrett: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">In fact, yes, I&rsquo;ve recorded another song entitled &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Remember,&rdquo; which pays homage to Michael, and John Lennon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo;:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Can you share your memories of meeting Jackson for the first time? And of the last time you saw him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Garrett: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">After Michael and Quincy Jones accepted &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; Michael wanted to record it in a lower key that was more comfortable for him. Quincy Jones called me to come to the studio to rerecord the song. When I met MJ, I remember him being really down-to-earth. As I resang the demo in the new key, Michael was holding a video camera recording my performance. When I asked why, he responded that he loved my voice and my energy, and that he wanted to sing it just like I did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As for the last time I saw him, I had reached out to him in 2009 when I learned he was making plans to go back on tour. I caught up with him on the phone during the Michael Jackson week on &ldquo;American Idol,&rdquo; four weeks before he died. He congratulated me on my Grammy win and Oscar nomination. I later saw him at his tour audition three weeks before he died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo;:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you remember most about Jackson? What memories stay fresh in your mind to this day?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Garrett: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was incredibly creative, a perfectionist in the studio and on stage. He had a childlike sense of humor. While in the studio recording our duet &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You,&rdquo; Michael recorded his part, but when it came to me singing my verses, he began tossing popcorn in my face in an effort to make me mess up. Quincy Jones, not seeing this, began to chastise me for flubbing the takes. Michael, on the other hand, was just cracking up!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Can you share the story that went into the making of &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Garrett: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I was signed to Quincy Jones as one of his songwriters. He called us all to describe the type of song they needed to complete MJ&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; album. I later got together with my main writing partner at the time, Glen Ballard, and as he began to search for sounds on his keyboard, I began to flip through my lyric notebook for a random idea. The phrase &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; which I had written in the book two years earlier, just popped out of me. I began writing on that theme, and the lyrics began to flow. Within 15 minutes, we had the first verse and the chorus of the song. We split up to work on our respective assignments, Glen the music and me the melody and lyrics. Two days later, we completed the demo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Philippine Daily Inquirer&rdquo;:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You have collaborated and worked with, or sang background vocals for, other music giants and stars. Which of these talents stand out in your mind and why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Garrett: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;d have to say Quincy Jones because he introduced me to the world as a songwriter and a recording artist. He brought &ldquo;Man in the Mirror&rdquo; to MJ&rsquo;s attention, and suggested that I be MJ&rsquo;s duet partner on &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
