I went, &quot;Ok, great&quot;. And, in fact, we were gonna have a meeting, he and I, about exactly what parts of what songs he thought he might need some help on vocally, on the day he passed away. And so, we never had that final meeting and he never told me what songs, but you can probably guess, some of the--maybe the chorus of a certain song, we might use a pre-recorded vocal and then he would sing the verse. But I&#39;ll tell you something that he said to me, and it&#39;s something that I fundamentally disagree with, but I would never disagree with Michael Jackson, is he said to me, he goes, &quot;If the audience isn&#39;t hearing the song exactly the way it sounds on the record, I feel they are being sonically cheated&quot; and I remember almost feeling surprised when he said that because the reason I like going to a concert is I&#39;m expecting it to sound different, you know? I&#39;m expecting solos to be longer, I&#39;m expecting dance breaks to be longer, I&#39;m expecting different intros and different endings and things like that, so I don&#39;t--but I didn&#39;t say that to him, I mean part of me wishes I would have, but I didn&#39;t want to disagree with him. I mean, it&#39;s his show, he&#39;s been touring since he was five or six... I&#39;m sure for many, many years, sang everything live, and then, at some point, maybe they had it as a safety valve for a night if he had a sore throat, and he went, &quot;Wow, that went really well&quot;, and then it sticks in his head, and I just think by the time we got to the HIStory Tour and--you have to pardon me for not being on the Dangerous or the Bad Tour, because I don&#39;t really know what, if anything, was lip-synced, but I don&#39;t think that the HIStory Tour was his first foray into lip-syncing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There could be a number of reasons for [having to perform with pre-recorded vocals], but I am so, so glad to hear that Michael, by the end, was really excited to start singing a lot more live again, &#39;cause, boy, was he a great live singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He really was. And I know that was his plan. Like I said, that night, our last night together, I went to his dressing room, it was just he and I, and one of the things he said is, he goes, &quot;Tomorrow, we&#39;re gonna discuss my vocals for the tour&quot;... he already had it planned, believe me. When Michael had something in his head, he could think it all the way through, didn&#39;t have to take notes, but he definitely was planning on a lot more live singing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why do you think he had that change of heart, given that he had that ethos about the audience needing to hear the song the way it sounds on the record. Why do you think he revised that for the This Is It shows?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I think he was aware that many of his fans and most of the critics--when I say critics, I mean people that write articles about the shows--were aware that there was quite a bit of lip-syncing going on, and that he really wasn&#39;t--not that he was trying to fool anybody, but I think for a while he felt comfortable in it, you know what I mean? And he just thought, &quot;Well, I know the vocals are going to be great tonight, I have to dance my ass off&quot; and just so you know, we have some recordings that we made, multitrack recordings, and he actually does sing the entire show, we just don&#39;t use that vocal. It has to be said, I&#39;ve listened to them both, that--hey, the one on the album is perfect. I mean, how much better can you get than perfect? And I think it probably shortened up his warmup times and things like that, but I think the thing is is over the years, Michael just got more and more comfortable with using a pre-recorded vocal... The other thing he would worry about, and you can say the old adage, &quot;You&#39;re only as good as your last show&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re only as good as your last album&quot;, and then you can take that one step further, and you can go, &quot;You&#39;re only as good singing-wise as the worst note you hit that night&quot;, so he may sing 15 songs perfectly and have a bad note, and that&#39;s what somebody&#39;s gonna write about the next day in the paper. And I really think he thought all that stuff through.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lavelle Smith, dancer, and Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1111/01/pmt.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Piers Morgan interview (November 1, 2011)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">we started working on &quot;This Is It.&quot; When he called that in 2008 in Vegas, and that was going to be -- he was excited. You know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We were both bringing out costumes, picking props. You know, thinking about what that show could be. Had no name. And just had a great time for six months in Vegas working like crazy. He was excited. I was excited. You know, whenever he gets excited, I get excited.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Michael, you can&#39;t believe what happened? I mean, you guys, had been working with Michael right to the end. Was there a massive shock? I mean, were there any signs that he was -- you know, I&#39;ve heard contrary views. I heard that he was very frail, that the stuff you didn&#39;t see in the movie, he was fainting. He was always kind of faint. That&#39;s what some of the family believe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What did you see?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: All of 2008, I was in Vegas along with Lavelle. He&#39;d show up on dance days. I showed up on music days. And I just had the feeling, Michael is getting ready for his close up. He just started looking better. You could tell he was -- his energy was going up. And then in 2009, extremely excited. You know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He gave us a speech about how important this was to him. That he could spend the rest of his life doing his greatest hits, but that&#39;s not what he wanted to do. He said, I want to write new songs. I want to have better songs than I ever had. We&#39;re going to add those to the show. And I really have never seen him that energized before. That in the moment before, right up until the last night when I gave him a hug and he gave me a hug, you know. And he felt strong. He said tomorrow we&#39;re going to discuss all the vocals for the tour, you know. And that was the last time I spoke to him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I mean, from a dance point of view, from a voice point of view, where was he do you think given all the experience you have had with him? Was he ready to go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: There was no stopping him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: To do 50 shows?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Oh, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes, 50, but at first --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Remember his pace -- not to interrupt, but his pace was going to be two, two and a half shows a week. His family was going to be there. He was going to have a house in London, outside of London. And we had a good chat. He and I about that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How this was the hard part, rehearsing is the hard part. You know, four, five, six nights a week. Doing videos during the day. Once we got to the U.K., once we started the shows, that was going to be almost a vacation. Truly, you know. I don&#39;t want to say that because they were going to pay me, but I mean, honestly, it would have been. And he knew that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: So originally it was ten shows.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Then he got made in to 50. I remember that happening. I think, you know, Michael, you&#39;re talking about a guy who was not as young as he used to be. 50 shows is pretty demanding, even if you&#39;re only doing 2, 3 shows a week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Absolutely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I remember him saying there&#39;s ten shows. It&#39;s going to be fantastic. And I do remember a day when the ten shows turned to 34. He said, Lavelle, you know, there&#39;s 34 shows, I got to do them. That seemed to be a little bit like, you know, wow, this is a lot. And Then I remember it kept growing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What I remember is that he was really honored that that many people wanted to see him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I had tickets to the first one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I was excited. I mean, he -- I saw him in Paris once. It was the best concert I ever saw.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Men, he was just honored that people wanted to see so as much as maybe 34 or the 50 shows were like, oh man, this is going to be crazy. The smile on his face showed me that he felt so honored that people really wanted to see him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Let me ask you a different question. Did you ever see him taking drugs of any kind?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Never.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: He seems to have been a very closed world. What we&#39;re hearing from all this trial that&#39;s happened and from interviews of people involved is that there were two Michaels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was the Michael that people thought they knew and there was the guy who chronic pain from when he had the terrible Pepsi accident and then to counter this, the terrible insomnia he used to get, mixed with the pressure and everything else, and so he got more and more into sleeping medication ending up with Demerol for the pain and the Propofol for sleeping.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I mean, you put it all together and he was leading two lives. I mean, there was a night time Michael Jackson that you guys I assume didn&#39;t see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Did not see. And honestly, most of the time, when we were with him, I don&#39;t think that night time Michael Jackson was around because he had the kids around. We were at the ranch. We were at a hotel almost like a vacation and we&#39;re working on new songs. And there was no pressure on him. He didn&#39;t have to get up the next day if he didn&#39;t want to. He didn&#39;t have to perform the next day. I think that pressure comes in to play when there&#39;s a show. You know? When there&#39;s a huge tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Exactly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Let&#39;s take a little break. I want to come back and talk to you about the dreadful day that you both found out that Michael died. And how you see his legacy developing. How you would like it to develop. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vibe.com/2010/06/redemption-songs-michael-jackson-pg-6/"><span class="cs8567212B">Vibe (June 21, 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He really had hoped during the London shows that he would be able to reveal some of his new material,&rdquo; Ortega recalls. &ldquo;The new songs were a big part of Michael&rsquo;s time when he wasn&rsquo;t at rehearsal.&rdquo; Over and over Michael would excitedly tell This Is It&rsquo;s production crew of his plans to return to the top of the pop charts with the music he and his team were making in Vegas. &ldquo;Soon, soon . . . &rdquo; Michael would say to Ortega. &ldquo;I want you to hear what we are doing.&rdquo; But it was not to be. On June 25, 2009, the music stopped.</span></p></body>
