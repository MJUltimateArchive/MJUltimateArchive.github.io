The doctor made us cancel two weeks of shows.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Even then, Michael had to take it easy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was so bad Marlon would hold down certain notes I was supposed to do and I would stand there pretending I was singing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was true even though the keys have long since been lowered on the early Jackson 5 hits. &quot;We had to change the keys,&quot; Michael says. &quot;I sounded like Minnie Mouse on those things.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Greg Phillinganes, keyboardist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110647/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/musician1984.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Musician&rdquo; magazine (July 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Greg Phillinganes, who in 1978 had helped form the group&#39;s musical ideas for &quot;Destiny&quot; into recordable arrangements, recalled that he &quot;was fairly surprised at how much music they had in them. They were really enthusiastic and excited because for the first time in their entire careers they controlled the music. All of them could write, but I thought Michael and Randy were probably the strongest.&quot; The two youngest Jackson sons proved Phillinganes right by composing the album&#39;s monster hit &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;, to which Phillinganes contributed a bootie-shaking synth-bass line. (&quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot; is also significant because John Luongo&#39;s mix, heightening the drum and bass tracks, made it one of the first major label singles to profit from a DJ&#39;s remix.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan &ldquo;Sugar&rdquo; Moffett, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The other drummer to tour exclusively with Michael was Jonathan &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; Moffett and, like Ricky, he began his work with Michael when the superstar was still part of The Jacksons. Jonathan was a member of a New Orleans group called The Money Band when his playing caught ear of Jermaine Jackson, who put out an invitation for Jonathan to come out to LA in 1979 through Alfred Guillard, singer in The Money Band.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I arrived about the middle of January and I auditioned for The Jacksons on February 21st, about a month later&quot;, remembers Jonathan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After running through some Jackson 5 tunes, Jonathan was finally asked to play &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He thought that he was going to stump me. When we started playing &quot;Shake Your Body&quot; in the audition, everybody in the room started looking at each other and whispering with a smile on their face, I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Oh no, I must be playing it wrong.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">About a minute into the groove, Randy Jackson came over and stopped me. I said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He said, &quot;I&#39;ve got to see this again.&quot; I&#39;m thinking, &quot;They&#39;re laughing at me, I must suck.&quot; We played it again and he stops me again. The whole room is laughing. I said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Am I messing up?&quot; And Randy said, &quot;No, you don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on. That song was recorded in three parts. It was never played all at one time. The drummer Ed Greene played the basic beat, two and four on the bass and the snare, then on a separate track, he went back and did the hi-hat figure. Then on a third take, he added the toms and here you are playing it all at one time and nobody else could play it like that without losing anything.&quot; I was shocked, I just said, &quot;Why not?&quot; That was always my mentality. They were all impressed, and that&#39;s when they said, &quot;You&#39;re our drummer, Sugarfoot.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;From the first day I did a show with him, we had a creative connection&quot;, says Jonathan. &quot;I could feel what he would do, I would watch him so closely that I would know how to hit the appropriate accent to make his visual moves dynamic. I was like the foley artist for him and he loved that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;After the very first show, he called me into his room. I was worried I must have messed up. That was the longest walk to his room. He called me in and he said, &#39;How did you know I was going to do this move? How did you know I was going to hit that?&#39; I said, &#39;I don&#39;t know. I could feel it.&#39; He said, &#39;Okay, but when I did the spin and stopped on a dime, how did you know when I was going to stop?&#39; I said, &#39;I was watching you very closely and I could intuitively feel what you were going to do.&#39; He said, &#39;I love that. Keep doing that. Never stop doing that! It&#39;s like magic.&quot; From then on, we had a special chemistry.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-061-jonathan-sugarfoot-moffett-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast Episode 061 (July 21, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And I&#39;ve read online that the song that did it for you was &quot;Shake Your Body&quot;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, &quot;Shake Your Body&quot; was the hit at the time, around the time, and it was interesting because back in New Orleans, when it came out, it was the coolest beat ever. Everybody, every drummer was defined if you can play &quot;Shake Your Body&quot; or not. You were defining whether you were a good drummer or a bad drummer. Most people couldn&#39;t play it, and the thing is and it&#39;s that they couldn&#39;t play it without leaving any element of it off, you know? I had something missing in the beat, in the song, in the groove. They trying to do something else on the kit. So, in a way sometimes, how do I put this? Sometimes ignorance can be bliss, because I didn&#39;t know how the guy was doing it. I just knew he was doing it, and it sounded like it sounded and then I got to know something. He&#39;s human. If he can do it, I can do it. I just got to figure it out, so I got the experiment on the drums of that beat, put the needle back in it &#39;cause we had the needles, 45s, and LPs, and I had to get off the drums each time when I make a mistake, and put it back and forth, and run back and forth to the kit. So, I just figured out and pictured in my mind as I&#39;m listening to the beat&mdash;a video in my mind of how he had to be doing, across his hands, not to leave out the hi-hat, and then I started scientifically experimenting in different ways, and then Eureka! I came up with the way to do it and nothing was left out... what sealed it for me with the auditions was that beat. But little did they know, I had worked that out back in New Orleans. And when the first record first dropped, then I had to play it on a recording session for a producer at Allen Toussaint&#39;s world-famous studio in New Orleans. He&#39;s a great producer, historic producer down there, who had one of his staff member producers&mdash;and I used to work for him doing demos&mdash;and he was producing this woman or this girl, and he wanted to steal that song, straight out rip it off. I had learned it already, so I told him I could play it, and we got in the studio and I played it for them, but the brothers didn&#39;t know that, so of course when I auditioned, they were shocked. They were like, okay, we gonna see if you can play this. Nobody that came in here can play it. I was pre-prepared, I already played on a record that basically the guys stole it from. But anyway, they call that song after playing &quot;Stop the Love You Save&quot;, &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot;, and that&#39;s when she goes, &quot;Okay, okay, we want to see if you can play this. Do you know how to play &#39;Shake Your Body?&#39;&quot;, he said it with attitude with his arm across the neck of his guitar and had a posture like, &quot;We&#39;re gonna see...&quot; His head was cocked to the side like, &quot;Yeah, yeah, right. Here comes another sucker. He gonna think he can play it, and we gonna see this. Can you play &#39;Shake Your Body&#39;&quot;? I said, &quot;Yeah, I can play that&quot;, and I said it with so much happy confidence, he sat up and said, &quot;What? You can play &#39;Shake Your Body&#39;?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, I can play that.&quot; I had total confidence because I knew that. He said, &quot;Okay, okay, and everybody looking at each other, there was laughter, and murmuring in there and in the room and this is a studio at Hayvenhurst and the brothers in the family studio, and they say, &quot;Okay we gonna see if you can play this.&quot; And so, I say, &quot;Okay let&#39;s go&quot;, and he counted off and I start playing it. And about thirty seconds in the song&mdash;Randy was there, and Jackie was there, Marlon was there, Tito was there, Michael was not there. And almost from across the room Randy comes walking towards me, and I&#39;m playing it, and everybody start looking at each other, and the band members was there&mdash;you know the band members were there&mdash;and they like looking at each other with a puzzled look on their face. But I said to myself, &quot;Oh man, I&#39;m blowing it. I&#39;m screwing it up. They all looking at me funny.&quot; I&#39;m thinking that, you know. And I&#39;m playing it, I said (to myself), &quot;I&#39;m going home...&quot; And Randy came over toward me, looked at me, he turned his head to look under the hi-hat and the snare drum, and he&#39;s looking around. He&#39;s looked at the guys with this funny look, and he put his hand on his mouth and I&#39;m saying, &quot;Oh man, you blowing it. What are you doing wrong?&quot; And then he said, &quot;Hold&mdash;wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!&quot;, he waved his hands. &quot;Wait, you guys, wait, wait, stop!&quot; I said, &quot;What, I&#39;m playing it wrong? I said no, no, no, just play it again. Play it again one more time, so I said, &quot;Okay, okay&quot;. I start playing it again... and he said, &quot;No no, stop. Play it slow, play it slow.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh okay, I&#39;ve never played it slow before. I&#39;ll do it slow. So I play this slow, where he can see the exchanges of things, and I start playing it slow, and he&#39;s looking at me, at me playing and analyzing my foot, my hand&mdash;both hands and the way I&#39;m crossing over to the times of different things, then he grabs his face like real quickly, and suddenly &quot;Oh!&quot;, and threw his head back and stumbled back from my drums, and looking at the people and the guys in the room and they say, &quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait!&quot;, and they start laughing and talking and mumbling to each other, and Jackie and Marlon whispering in each other&#39;s ears smiling. I&#39;m thinking to myself, &quot;Man, they laughing at me. Man, I must be really screwing this up.&quot;... and that&#39;s when Randy came back over and said, &quot;No, no.&quot; I said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong, I&#39;m playing it wrong?&quot; Then Randy came to me and like laughing, smiling, and said &quot;No, no, Foot. You don&#39;t understand.&quot; I said, &quot;What?&quot; He said, &ldquo;That beat was a three-part overdub.&rdquo; I said, &quot;Three-part? What is that?&quot; I didn&#39;t know what that was. He said that beat was played three times, three separate sections. The drummer couldn&#39;t play it all at once, so we had him go play the main beat, and there was kick a snare hats with straight eighth notes, and then we had to go back on a separate pass of recordings and overdub on a different track, the hi-hat part, that opens and closes at certain intervals. We had to go back on the third pass and overdub the time parts that interwoven in the pattern, and here you are playing it all at one time and nobody else who came here could play it at one time. I said, &quot;Oh really? Why they couldn&#39;t play it?&quot; I was just puzzled. I said, &quot;Really? Why?&quot;, and they bust up laughing, and then he put his hand on my shoulder. He said, &quot;Sugarfoot, you&#39;re our drummer, you&#39;re our drummer.&quot; and he said, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re our drummer&quot;, and I said, &quot;Oh, really? Thank you! Thank you, thank you!&quot;...Jermaine&#39;s the one that my friend got the call, at first, had asked me to come to L.A. and be with with him on some project&mdash;I never found out what it was about. But that&#39;s what Randy said, &quot;No, no, you&#39;re our drummer for&mdash;Jermaine&#39;s not getting you, we got you now.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, okay&quot;, so that&#39;s how I got with the Jacksons. They said, &quot;You&#39;re our drummer, and then they told me, &quot;Well, Joseph want to talk to you&rdquo;, and so now he said, &quot;Now come out in the yard.&quot; We ended everything because, you know I had a gig, and I went in the yard, walking around in the field of the grass with Joseph, talking business and the first time talking with anything about that, my first tour ever. And he said, &quot;The boys like you, they really like you. They want you to be their drummer. Do you want to be the drummer for the Jacksons, my boys?&rdquo; I said, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;d be great! I&#39;d love that.&rdquo; He said, &quot;Okay, yeah, they really want you, you&#39;re hired.&quot; And that&#39;s how I got the gig.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">The audition, I didn&#39;t know&mdash;like I say, ignorance is bliss sometime, I didn&#39;t know that the guy&mdash;I couldn&#39;t see him doing when I put the record on, I couldn&#39;t see how he did it. I just know he did it. I was ignorant to the fact that it was a three-part overdub, that he had to cheat and do it, and I just figured, he can do it, I can do it. He&#39;s human being, I can do it. I got to figure this out, and if I get this, it&#39;ll be really cool. That was my thing as a young man. I get this, it would be really cool. And he&#39;s doing it, so I want to do that. So that was my challenge to myself, and it worked out.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We spend a lot of time as Michael Jackson fans talking about those later tours, like &quot;Bad&quot; &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;HIStory&quot;, &quot;This Is It&quot;, all of that kind of thing, but I think some of the tours that get missed in the conversation a little bit are those early tours, like &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Triumph&quot;, and &quot;Victory&quot;. I want you to talk to us about the Jacksons as live performers. How hands-on were they in their tours in the &#39;70s and &#39;80s?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How hands on? They were in absolute control. It was their vision, their project, their endeavor, and they were absolute controlled. I don&#39;t know who they clanned with, as far as production people and all that stuff. I wasn&#39;t privy to those meetings and things like that, but the things that we were described by them to do, as far as show arrangements, the brothers had total control over everything, and that was collectively, not just Michael&#39;s, everybody. All the brothers had input, and it was a great experience for me, and you got to understand, that was my first professional tour ever, and I was at school. I was all eyes and ears pencil sharpened and ready, tablets ready to be written on, I mean mentally and emotionally, because I don&#39;t read music. I don&#39;t know if I said that, but I don&#39;t read music. Everything&#39;s from the spirit and the soul, and memory retention, because I don&#39;t read music not compensated by developing a sharp memory retention, as to what I hear, and a few times I can get it, you know. Time and two or a few times, I can get it and mimic it. So they come in and explain what they wanted to do, and we all get copies of the cassettes&mdash;at that time that was what was happening&mdash;get copies of the cassettes and of the songs&mdash;those record songs, album songs&mdash;and we learned, and that was our homework. We get that, what, a few days a week? Maybe sometime a week or two before, and we do our homework as professionals, it was my first time being a professional, but I do it because I knew it took. I wanted to be on that level, and I didn&#39;t want to miss the opportunity, so I took it so seriously, very seriously to go in there, knowing what my part was, and doing it very, very well, just like the record. That was always in my mind, just like the record, so I can impress them. So, I did my homework and I show up, then we start dissecting the song as far as how much of a song we can do in the intro, the first verse, second verse, if you&#39;re going to do a second verse or not, a bridge, if we&#39;re going to go to the bridge or not. If we&#39;re going to have a breakdown, are we going to have a solo extra soul section in the song. Are we going to stretch out the ending, the tag of the song, and the vamp of the song. And all of that was done in the rehearsals, and the brothers&#39; ideas, and&mdash;I kept quiet all of that time, &#39;cause I was like a student in school. You don&#39;t talk when the teacher&#39;s talking. And all of them were teachers for me, and I was learning from the best&mdash;what I considered the best, so I had great, great love and admiration for them. Love grew even more as I went along to be used with them, but my admiration was always at its fullest when I started with them, first started with them. I had great admiration so, of course, in respect and so, of course, I adhere to what they wanted. I was learning, I was a sponge, absorbing everything I could. I was like Michael. Michael&#39;s like a sponge, me and Michael apparently are, like I said, in many, many ways and levels, and I was like a sponge, and absorbing from all of them, because they all had great ideas and very intelligent and very creative, because they had been in a business so very long, since youth, and I had so much to learn. So &quot;Destiny Tour&quot; was my training ground and my proving ground, and it was a fun, fun tour. It only lasted, I think three months but it was the experience of my lifetime, &#39;cause it being the first time, it&#39;s the experience of my lifetime. I mean, all the other tours, even the big, big ones are magnificent and great, but you always remember your first time, because that&#39;s your challenging time, and the one you overcame to be that, become that, what you wanted to be, and sought to be. So &quot;Destiny Tour&quot; was that, and we played all the hit songs from the Jackson 5, of course, and then from the &quot;Destiny&quot; album... featuring was out there promoting, and all of those songs was fun to play. And great arrangements, and it was just a small band. One keyboard player, the musical director&mdash;who got me the audition&mdash;my friend James Macfield, who&#39;s from New Orleans and his mother&#39;s house wasn&#39;t a block and still is a block from my mother&#39;s house, and we were in Rabble bands back there and he was a wonderful spirit and a great player, concert pianist, and pop pianist, and he had a lot of input with the brothers. I can&#39;t afford to leave that out because I submitted the brothers doing everything, but no, it was also including expertise with James who helped guide them to and had great, great ideas because the arrangements of the show were fantastic. They would collaborate with him, put it all together. They had really, really great ideas as well, but he would formulate the whole thing, and if they had something really creative, he&#39;d go around with them and figure out how to incorporate it within the song, the arrangement, or the embodiment of the song within the show as a collective, so yeah, they had a great collaborator with James. He&#39;s a great friend of mine. And still to this day we talk, now we back in touch, and we talk and reminisce when I go to New Orleans, I go down there and talk with him and hang out. He comes to my mother&#39;s house and we have great love and admiration for each other. We&#39;re like brothers, kindred spirits, as we were when we first met playing in Rabble bands in New Orleans. We hit it off right away, and we&#39;ve been that way all our lives. It&#39;s pretty remarkable. We&#39;re close, close friends and he helped guide me. He helped groom me as well. His tutelage in that period of time was most beneficial to me, and effective for me, because I trusted in him. I knew he knew what the brothers wanted, and he knew I had the skills and stuff, and I knew he had the knowledge, and he had also had the ways the brothers like to work. So, I just listened to him and did what he said, they liked what they liked, and he got me in things like that and he did a lot of the breaks and the accents, and taught me all that stuff because they were doing tunes before I joined them. I replaced the drummer that had left, so I&#39;m redoing that show. I had to learn the show. And I only had three days, three measly days to learn the whole show&mdash;my first professional tour ever, I had only three days, I don&#39;t even read, so I would memorize everything, every aspect of it in three days&#39; rehearsal, then we hit the road, so...</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Q):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Superhuman, Jonathan. Superhuman&hellip; You said &quot;Destiny&quot;, you have such fond memories of the &quot;Destiny Tour&quot;, it was like your first&mdash;was &quot;Destiny&quot; your favorite or, if not, what was your favorite of &quot;The Jacksons&quot; tours and why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I love that tour, and it was amazing, and it was learning, and it was a great show. I sometime listen to the audio recordings I have of rehearsals and of some of the shows, and I still you know like that&mdash;I really liked that show, and it was new for me. Know what else was new for me about that show? It was my first introduction to costumes, stage costumes. I had never been around that&mdash;so New Orleans, you just put some clothes on you got from the local hip-hop store, a store that was like the local fashion, with the bell bottoms, you tie your shirt up, let your stomach staccato or something like that, muscle shirts and theater stuff like that, tight pants, and that was a nightclub scene in New Orleans, but these were actual stage costumes for a professional concert tour, and I got my first experience on the &quot;Destiny Tour&quot; to look at the amazing costumes to me at the time. Amazing costumes, and they gave me some old Jackson costumes to wear myself, and I&#39;m like, &quot;Wow, got old Jackson 5 costumes&quot;, and I&#39;ve never been in that element of it. It was exciting for me to be in the whole show business element of it that even went to the costumes&hellip; And then after that what tour you failed to mention was &quot;Off the Wall&quot; tour, was the second half of &#39;79, which was a combination. Michael had already dropped &quot;Off the Wall&quot; album was out there to promote that and the &quot;Destiny&quot; album, so we call or tend to call it the &quot;Off the Wall / Destiny Tour&quot;... And that one was in the fall, winter of &#39;79. &ldquo;Destiny&rdquo; was from March 1st, and we finished around&mdash;I think right before June 1st, something like that, early June, and then we went back out September 1st and 2nd, and then the first show was my real treat, [it] was in my hometown New Orleans, so I got the first time to play on a professional level in my hometown for my family and my friends and my city to see me with &quot;The Jacksons&quot;, so that was pretty incredible for me, and that was the &quot;Off the Wall Tour&quot;, which was amazing. And you could feel the step up it was, and see the step up it was that from &quot;Destiny&quot;, because there was a lot more production, stage production, and tremendous more lighting and&mdash;not tremendous, but a lot more lighting. And the stage was different, and the show, we changed the show around a bit to add the &quot;Off the Wall&quot; stuff in there, and you could see it on YouTube, and they got incredible costumes&mdash;way better than the last ones. It was pretty amazing, brothers&#39; costumes were amazing even more so, which got me excited &#39;cause I&#39;m into fashion and stuff like that and designing clothes, so that&#39;s another hidden element that had be excited for doing concerts because of the uniforms in the concerts. So there were designs of them, concept of them, and so that was a really great tour as well. And we added horns and then I would say&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Delroi Whitaker, photographer during &ldquo;Destiny Tour&rdquo;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.whitakerhistoricphotography.com/jacksons.html"><span class="cs8567212B">personal website (2005 post)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To Michael: Working as a personal photographer, I have seen a lot of very nice things you have done over the years. One thing that stands out in my mind is a big compliment you paid to me. You ordered some personal photographs from me through a friend, April. After April had given them to you, you told April that my photos were better than your own personal photographer&#39;s photos. I never had a chance to say THANK YOU for that wonderful compliment. I give all the glory to the LORD. Thank you Michael, and stay strong.</span></p></body>
