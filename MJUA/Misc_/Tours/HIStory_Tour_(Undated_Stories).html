I tried to be disciplined but add little colors here and there or change a pattern ever so slightly to make it more funky, like on &#39;Smooth Criminal&#39;. If you listen to the kick drum pattern, for the most part, it&#39;s exactly like the record, but I put a staggered beat in it that makes it more funky.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Benny Collins, tour production manager, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105932/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/historyaustraliatour.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Herald Sun&quot; (1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of Jackson&#39;s closest aides, &nbsp;Benny Collins, spoke exclusively to the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael wants to present to the world something theatrical&quot;, Collins says. &quot;It&#39;s his story, it&#39;s Michael Jackson showing his life. I call it playing his life story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was once said to me that [Michael] could just go on stage, himself, one lightbulb, and that would be fine&quot;, Collins laughs. &quot;But that isn&#39;t him. That isn&#39;t Michael Jackson.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...On the subject of a noticeably confident, masculine Jackson, and that the singer appears to have reclaimed his honor after the controversies of recent years, Collins offers this:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael is Michael. It is Michael. Different tours require different moods, a different person, a different aura, if you want to call it that. The Michael I seee is the Michael I know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Yes, there is more power coming out of him. I think he&#39;s just letting it go.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...[Michael] used his first few days in Sydney to paint himself as a man of the people, jumping from his van to greet fans, and sending flowers, gifts, CDs, and posters in every direction.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s the same relationship, Collins says, that exists between Jackson and his fans in the HIStory show. &quot;It breaks the plane that all audiences want artists to break: which is the front of stage.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Those on the tour travel like a happy family. The headlines don&#39;t faze them: almost nothing surprises them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I get angry&quot;, Collins says about some of the misinformation.&quot;, because newspapers don&#39;t tell the whole story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We get so angry so many times, we become protective. We see strangers and we want to know, &#39;who are you, why are you here?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But, at some point, you block it out, because you have to move on. We know the Michael we know, we love the Michael we know.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What is Jackson like as a boss?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;s very calm&quot;, Collins says, &quot;Michael is not a yeller, not a screamer. He talks.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He says Jackson is quick, decisive, exact. A perfectionist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also has a vivid imagination.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He is very sharp&quot;, Collins says. &quot;We have had a couple of discussions where there are no limitations on our thoughts, which for me, on the production side, at times is difficult, because I always have to remember I have got to make it happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But it also gives you the opportunity is there, and you afford the opportunity.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-052-michael-prince-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 52 (March 19, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csE372B9B3">I didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d ever see anybody again [after the &ldquo;One Night Only&rdquo; was cancelled], but the next spring, the drummer who was gonna be on that special was Ricky Lawson. He was a good friend of mine, and he started calling me and asking me if I would like to do the Steely Dan Tour with him. And I&#39;m going, &quot;Well that sounds good, Steely Dan&#39;s one of my favorite bands&quot;... I actually went down and ran monitors for Steely Dan for a couple days, and Ricky got the gig as the drummer, &#39;cause they were looking for a drummer just for that tour, and I called up a name you may know, Benny Collins. And Benny Collins was Michael&#39;s tour/production manager, and had been for several tours, and I called Benny, and I go, &quot;Hey, Benny, I have this opportunity to go out on a Steely Dan tour, but I don&#39;t want to miss a Michael Jackson tour. And he goes, &quot;Well, there&#39;s nothing official that I can tell you right now, but MJ has talked about touring this year. And so I basically had to make a decision on my own with no information. I had a for-sure gig with Steely Dan and I had, well, maybe in two or three or more weeks, we&#39;re gonna know about Michael&#39;s touring situation, and I just called up Ricky and I said, &quot;I can&#39;t do Steely Dan.&quot; And he was mad at me ever since--for the next 15 years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">MJCast:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> If I may ask, why&#39;d you make that risky call?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">Prince:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> That&#39;s a good question, because to be quite honest with you, the pay would have probably been the same. I can only think that I had started developing, other than a good relationship with Ricky Lawson, a good relationship with Brad Buxer. And Brad said, &quot;Michael, if there&#39;s a tour, we&#39;d definitely want to use you&quot;, and I went, &quot;Ok&quot;. And I think Michael just had a history of touring more often than Steely Dan. Steely Dan, they would go for ten years without touring. And do several albums without touring, so when they toured, it was sort of a unique thing, and you didn&#39;t know if the tour was gonna be two months or four, but you knew it wasn&#39;t gonna be a year-long or anything like that. So, let&#39;s put it this way, I made the right call for once, and about two weeks later, Benny called me and Brad called me and said, &quot;Yep, MJ just said he&#39;s gonna tour.&quot;...</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&#39;s a Michael Jackson tour like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Beyond anything I had ever imagined, because we toured in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, and 90&#39;s with some fairly big main acts, like when we played with Kiss, there were 20-30,000 people there, but still you&#39;re looking at 4 to 6 trucks, and 3 or 4 buses, and we had one truck and one bus. And, to my mind, there was no catering or anything like that, so you start to find out more about the vastness of these tours as they began to get assembled, because obviously you don&#39;t have catering when you&#39;re in rehearsal. Somebody just brings food in every day. By the time you get to Europe, you realize you&#39;ve got the band, the dancers and MJ, and then you&#39;ve got a whole lighting crew, you&#39;ve got a whole sound crew, you&#39;ve got a whole bunch of back-line and band crew technicians, and then you&#39;ve got the whole video crew, and half of those guys are under the stage, and they&#39;re running all the videos you see on the side walls and what came on the jumbotron up above the band, and then you&#39;ve got cameramen. There&#39;s like four or five people running cameras, one guy on stage, a boom camera, and there was one out at front at house, and there was another one, and you realize that all these things are happening at the same time, so it&#39;s almost like a TV production that&#39;s live. Of course, they taped it every night, just so they could have a record of it, but you&#39;ve got a TV production going on, you&#39;ve got--back then, lighting wasn&#39;t as evolved as it is now. We had to have two lighting consoles and two guys running the lights, and then one of those two guys would be calling spots, which, if you really think about it, imagine moving all these lights with your hands, and at the same time, talking to six spotlight operators and telling each one what color they need to be on, and who they need to focus on and you have to count &#39;em in, just like, &quot;Ok, in three-two-one&quot; [snaps fingers], and they would be purple on the guitar player. I mean, that&#39;s a--I&#39;ve never tried that, but when I hear about it, I go like, &quot;That&#39;s impossible&rdquo;, &#39;cause that&#39;s multitasking at its best, I think. And then you meet the carpenters, and you meet the seamstresses, and you meet the wardrobe crew, and you meet, finally, the people that are doing all the cooking, and they&#39;re the hardest working people on the tour, because they have to get up at 4, 4:30 in the morning, find a local translator, depending on what country you&#39;re in, and rent a truck, and go to all these fresh food markets and buy vegetables, meats, eggs, stuff to make bread with. One lady was--her sole job was making pastries and desserts. And I&#39;m going like, &quot;Wow, this is like a whole traveling city&quot;. And it was. I think we had at least 120 employees, and we had three of those gigantic Soviet Antonov cargo planes, where the fronts open up, and we had, I wanna say--Brad thinks we had three planes. Michael had a big plane, the band had a big plane, and the crew had a big plane. Like a four-engine jet kind of a big plane, and I think he&#39;s right. I think he would remember that more than I do. And that was my introduction to touring. Once we got to Europe, I&#39;m going like, &quot;Holy cow&quot;. Really, it&#39;s a whole lot of individuals each doing their job to perfection every day, or every show, and that&#39;s what makes it work. And, oh, I forgot, you have a steel crew, and there were two steel crews, it took me a few weeks to figure that out, &#39;cause I kept seeing different people and I&#39;m going like, &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; and we had two stages, and it takes more than two days to build a stage, so they were leap-frogging. So if we played in Prague, that was crew number one and stage number one, and they would build that. And then, let&#39;s say the next place we&#39;re playing was Stockholm. Well, the second stage was already on its way to Stockholm from the previous gig and there was another set of steel workers that were putting that stage up, so we would see the same group of steelworkers every other day. And it was a two-day load-in. And what that means is the first day you would bring in the PA, the jumbotron, all the lights, hang them up off the stage, and do all that stuff. And then the day of the show, we would come in with all the band gear and all the stuff we needed to actually make music. The good thing about that was it gave people like me extra days off, which were wonderful. I really got a chance to do some sightseeing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How would you describe, in layman&#39;s terms, what your job on the tour was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> In the very beginning, I started out as the drum technician, mainly because I knew how to do all of the sampling and convert a drum trigger to a MIDI note, which then went to a sampler, which told the sampler what sound to play, and that was mixed in with like a real snare sound. And the funny thing is, before I did that, I had never changed a drum head in my life, which told me--and I knew this going in--that the job was more of an engineering/electronic gig than it was like &nbsp;a drum tech gig because, what I later found out is it&#39;s not that hard to &nbsp;change a drum head, and, in fact, the first two drummers I worked with were Ricky Lawson and John Moffett, and it kind of shocked me when they both told me I was the best drum technician they ever had, and I&#39;m going like, &quot;How is that possible?&quot;. But I think if you really, really care about what you&#39;re doing, and do it to the best of your ability, maybe you can rise to the top.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You mentioned earlier that Michael wants the music to sound just like the albums. Is that perhaps the reason why some of the songs sound like they&#39;re not using live vocals on that tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Two things that I--and it&#39;s not a secret that I would mention--one, and it goes way beyond Michael, it goes to almost anybody that is dancing a highly choreographed up-tempo song. You can&#39;t do that and sing live without getting completely out of breath. And once you get out of breath, you can&#39;t suck in enough air to sing a whole vocal line, so Michael, I think, learned that from other artists. And I won&#39;t mention any names at all, but there&#39;s definitely some other huge, huge artists that sang even less of their show than Michael did. And HIStory was not, it was the first tour I was involved in, as far as Michael goes, but there was lip-syncing on previous tours as well. And I think it started with the big production numbers where you had to do a lot of dancing and really focus on the dancing. Although I never really talked to him about it, like, &quot;Michael, why do you do this?&quot;, but we did have a lot of discussion before &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; about, in his words to me, that he wanted to sing much more than on the previous tours. I went, &quot;Ok, great&quot;. And, in fact, we were gonna have a meeting, he and I, about exactly what parts of what songs he thought he might need some help on vocally, on the day he passed away. And so, we never had that final meeting and he never told me what songs, but you can probably guess, some of the--maybe the chorus of a certain song, we might use a pre-recorded vocal and then he would sing the verse. But I&#39;ll tell you something that he said to me, and it&#39;s something that I fundamentally disagree with, but I would never disagree with Michael Jackson, is he said to me, he goes, &quot;If the audience isn&#39;t hearing the song exactly the way it sounds on the record, I feel they are being sonically cheated&quot; and I remember almost feeling surprised when he said that because the reason I like going to a concert is I&#39;m expecting it to sound different, you know? I&#39;m expecting solos to be longer, I&#39;m expecting dance breaks to be longer, I&#39;m expecting different intros and different endings and things like that, so I don&#39;t--but I didn&#39;t say that to him, I mean part of me wishes I would have, but I didn&#39;t want to disagree with him. I mean, it&#39;s his show, he&#39;s been touring since he was five or six... I&#39;m sure for many, many years, sang everything live, and then, at some point, maybe they had it as a safety valve for a night if he had a sore throat, and he went, &quot;Wow, that went really well&quot;, and then it sticks in his head, and I just think by the time we got to the HIStory Tour and--you have to pardon me for not being on the Dangerous or the Bad Tour, because I don&#39;t really know what, if anything, was lip-synced, but I don&#39;t think that the HIStory Tour was his first foray into lip-syncing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan &ldquo;Sugarfoot&rdquo; Moffett, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-061-jonathan-sugarfoot-moffett-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 061 (July 21, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Q):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&#39;m going to ask you about the &quot;HIStory Tour&quot;. I actually was very blessed to see two performances in Australia of the &quot;HIStory World Tour&quot; in 1996, and that was the only MJ solo tour that you worked on. How did the HIStory tour, in your work on that, compare back to &quot;The Jacksons&quot; tour? And did Michael seem as enthusiastic about touring by that stage in his career?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, that tour was steps above any of the other tours with the brothers. I wasn&#39;t on &quot;Bad&quot; because when they called me for &quot;Bad&quot;, I was supposed to be musical director actually, then he pushed it back 10 months, and I got a call a week or two later from Madonna for &quot;Who&#39;s That Girl Tour&quot;. And that&#39;s when I contacted Michael&#39;s organization and told them and they said, &quot;Well, we pushed back eight or nine months, ten months, and so you can go go ahead and do that. And when we&#39;re ready, we&#39;ll call you.&quot; So, I accepted the Madonna tour and then, when it came up, I was still under contract with Madonna and Madonna had extended it. I couldn&#39;t do the &quot;Bad Tour&quot;. That&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t on &quot;Bad&quot;, I was supposed to be there, and I was supposed to be musical director. So unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t get out of the contract with Madonna&mdash;it was impossible to do&mdash;so that&#39;s when the Ricky [Lawson] stepped in at that point and did that tour, and while I&#39;m doing a &quot;Bad Tour&quot;&mdash;and &quot;Dangerous&quot;, I happened to be with his sister Janet. His assistant, he&#39;s trying to pull me, and Janet said, &quot;No. He can&#39;t get you, I got you.&quot; And so, she wouldn&#39;t let me go, so I missed &quot;Dangerous Tour&quot;... And that&#39;s when he called me for the &quot;HIStory Tour&quot;. I was with the Isley Brothers at the time. Just was finishing up their rehearsals with them, to get ready to go out on tour with them that next week, and then I got a call from Brad Buxer, musical director for Michael, and he said, &quot;Michael wants you. He wants you really bad. He wants you to come back to him.&quot; I tell him, &quot;Well, I&#39;m with the Isley Brothers&quot;. He said, &quot;You gotta get out of it. Michael said he don&#39;t want nobody else but you. He wants you. You gotta do it.&quot; So, I said, &quot;Oh my god, I got to talk to Ronald Isley&quot;, who was the leader of the Isleys, and appeal to him if he would let me out of it. But fortunately enough, they didn&#39;t do contracts, so I didn&#39;t have a contract. it was just a word of mouth, verbal thing, and fortunately enough secondly, was that he understands&mdash;like everybody else in the industry know&mdash;my history with the brothers, that&#39;s my family. And if I didn&#39;t have contracts or other things, it would&#39;ve been easier to make a move, but I couldn&#39;t do it for that paperwork and the legal aspects are a little bit crazy. But with this one, I didn&#39;t have a contract... The next day I went in rehearsals and talked to Ronald, and appealed to him, and explained to him, and he was so understanding. Ronald is really wonderful with me. I love playing with Isaac, I miss the time I just did the rehearsals. Actually, I did a couple shows with them, until my replacement came in. And he was really understanding. He said, &quot;Well, Sugarfoot, you know we love you here. We love you here, we are so happy to have you here. We want you to stay. But then, again, I know that&#39;s your family. You started with them boys, and then that group, and that&#39;s your family. And I also know we can&#39;t afford you, to pay you what they pay you&quot; [Laughs] Had him laughing. But he was kind enough to say, &quot;We understand that you have to go and that&#39;s family call, you have to go&quot; and I say, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s my family, I love my family. And they need me&quot;, meaning Michael. And so, he said, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know who&#39;re we gonna get&quot; I said, &quot;Well, Rayford Griffin used to tour with you last before I came here. You can call him back, he knows you&#39;re sure already, you just have to add the new things in&quot;, and he said &quot;Yeah, yeah! That&#39;s what we should do.&quot; So, they wound up calling Rayford, and I wound up switching out, going back with Michael. They shipped my stuff from their rehearsals, the second gig I did with them, and then shipped Rayford&#39;s stuff in, and he just took over &#39;cause he knew this stuff, he&#39;d been with them for years. He&#39;s another one of my hero drummers, extraordinary drummer, truly remarkable drummer that admire greatly, and a great friend now. I love Rayford, and since his Jean-Luc Ponty days, I&#39;ve been a big fan of his, and trying to study him. And so, he went to the Isleys and took over that seat &#39;cause he knew it already, and I went to Michael &#39;cause I knew Michael&#39;s stuff. And I got back with Michael in &#39;96 for that tour. And &#39;96, &#39;97 we did that tour. I&#39;d say the best tour I&#39;ve done, out of all the tours that I&#39;ve done. That one and &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot; were the two best tours, and in different ways they were best from each other. &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot; was fantastic, because the magnitude of that staging was truly magnificent. They had thirteen hydraulic lifts on the stage, columns that come out of nowhere. I mean, just the whole stage was so robotic and animated, and the tour itself. I played on a number of Madonna&#39;s records. I got a chance to play my own work for a change as well as other works that are&mdash;people that I admired who played on our stuff, or was programmed. She has a multitude of fantastic songs, hit songs. I love Madonna and I love her work in music too. There were great opportunities for me, and that was my favorite tour of hers, &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot;. Magnificent tour. So those two tours in my favorites of all time but &quot;HIStory Tour&quot;, because Michael&#39;s at his peak and his songs were many albums that come out. &quot;Bad&quot; had come out, &quot;Thriller&quot; of course, and since I last worked with him, and then &quot;Bad&quot;. And I would visit the Victory Tour with Thriller, but since the &quot;Bad&quot; album came out, the &quot;Dangerous&quot; album came out, then of course the &quot;HIStory&quot; album had just been dropped, and it was at this peak of things. Each magnitude&mdash;and that was the most incredible tour with him, because he was on, he was magnificent. Man, every time I thought I saw everything he can do, he had me electrified, and I&#39;m back there in the drums screaming like I&#39;m in the audience, a fan, or something I guess. &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah!&quot; I was going crazy back there, watching him do some mind-boggling, unrealistic things and the spins. Long, long spins and the different other things, body movements, and things that I&#39;d never seen him do before, so I was still watching the role as a performer and artisan. And I&#39;d been away from him so long that it&#39;s fresh and new to me again, so it was my best tour I would say. That one and &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot;. They were almost like what I think &quot;HIStory&quot; was&mdash;because I loved Michael and his music&mdash;was a bit ahead of &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot;. They were close, but &quot;HIStory&quot; was my favorite, my absolute favorite tour I&#39;ve done in my career. I&#39;ve done 25 tours in my career.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You spoke a little earlier about the magic of being able to drum and control people&#39;s body movements with your work, and it just sort of dawned on me right then how amazing it would have been to sit at the back of the stage drumming, controlling Michael Jackson&#39;s body movements... Or at least inspiring his body movements, through your work. That would have been&mdash;that feeling must be indescribable.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Surrealistic. I stand back there and I look&mdash;now, I don&#39;t think&mdash;I&#39;m in the midst of that. First of all, when I tour, and I&#39;m playing, I&#39;m in the midst of my work. I&#39;m there to work, and my mind is&mdash;from the first downbeat of the first darkness of the curtain, I&#39;m in the phase of the mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I don&#39;t analyze things. &quot;Ohh, this is a great opportunity... Okay, look I&#39;m showing for Michael&quot;, and I don&#39;t think like that. &quot;Ok, alright I gotta make this show better than that last show. I got to do more magnificent, I gotta have more power. Play more finesse, more articulation, be more precise with my hits, my accents got to be spot-on like a computer, my timing got to be like a computer. I&#39;m feeling and thinking all of those things, you gotta be focused Jonathan, a hundred percent focused. Michael&#39;s counting on you, and that&#39;s what the midst of my work, more than moments of appreciation or thrills over what&mdash;I&#39;m there, I&#39;m behind Michael and stuff like that. I&#39;m looking at him like, I&#39;m watching him like with eagle eye for responses to his dance moves, that&#39;s what I&#39;m mainly there to make him feel it and hit responses to his spontaneous movements that he may do something and the theatrical way and just stop. And I got to be prepared, and got to be MIDI to him, I got to be &quot;synthy&quot; to him&mdash;if you know that means&mdash;and respond as if I&#39;m a Foley artist and us doing a soundtrack for film and something visual is happening. I got to add the Foley to it, that&#39;s the way I look at it, and I approach my work with Michael&mdash;all the artists when I do accents and stuff like that. I&#39;m always on cue, always on point. My focus and concentration is astute, and it&#39;s like I can feel it&mdash;it&#39;s beyond the spiritual being. I&#39;m so attuned to the moment in the time and the second I&#39;m in. From second to second, to minute, to minute, to moment to moment. I&#39;m in that moment, and I can&#39;t allow my mind to drift, so something can and will happen and you&#39;ll miss something, and then your reputation is not what it&#39;s supposed to be, and what it was or what it should be, as far as being reliable. So those things are utmost important for me. I take my work seriously. Very fortunately for me, I&#39;m sure many other musicians feel the same way. My work is my play. Because I don&#39;t work drums, I play drums. I play music, I don&#39;t work music, I play music. You can say I work music anyway since from pulling income with. I basically I go on stage to play music, not work music. I&#39;m fortunate that my work is my play, is my pleasure, so I&#39;m blessed in that respect, but I take it as serious. With that play on words, I do take it very, very serious. I mean extremely serious, and I treat it as if I am the artist. That&#39;s how important it is to me as if I&#39;m Michael, I&#39;m the artist, and I want it meticulously done, I want it perfectly to my standards. I treat it as if it&#39;s my show, not that it&#39;s my show I know who they&#39;re there to see, but I put as much focus of input into it as if I&#39;m the utmost important thing up there, and it&#39;s for me, my reputation, I&#39;m the artist out front. I approach my supportive role as if I&#39;m the artist, and I know I&#39;m not. But, in other words, I have that kind of concentration of focusing and will to do it right, and do it the best, and do it impressive that moves the audience, to shock the audience, to enliven the audience, to blow their minds, I&#39;m there to do that. And even though they&#39;re looking at Michael mostly, I&#39;m doing my part to contribute to that excitement for him, and it means the world to me. It means everything to me at that moment, whatever tour I&#39;m on, whoever&#39;s tour I&#39;m on. Means everything. It&#39;s existence of my life at that moment in time, that period of time. If there&#39;s two hours, that&#39;s my existence in life, and I put that much importance in it, and that&#39;s what I feel about, and that&#39;s how I approach it. I love working with Michael and I miss him so much. I miss him so much. He&#39;s incomparable. Yeah, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll ever be anybody like him. It can&#39;t&mdash;I can&#39;t see. I&#39;d be surprised&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&#39;ve got a question, this is from one of our followers @MJFFC on Twitter, and&mdash;I had a similar question, so I kinda joined them both together. Michael having worked with so many big name hip-hop producers that have a lot of very interesting, sort of complex beats on records. What was the process of trying to adapt a beat that&#39;s really like a hip-hop inspired complex beat on a song, to being a live production on a drum kit? How do you start adapting that?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, you just start&mdash;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Like &quot;Scream&quot; for example, or something like that.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> For me, it&#39;s easy. New Orleans music, and especially New Orleans drummers, we&#39;re very, very rhythmatic. Our beats down there is really tribal, as you&#39;re saying, tribal and rhythmic and syncopated a lot... And my learning and training through all the years playing in clubs and just the culture of it was all the drummers sayin&#39; &quot;How do you play New Orleans music? How do you learn that special thing one drummer&#39;s got?&quot; I say, &quot;You have to go down there and live amongst the culture, then you absorb it and you become it.&quot; There&#39;s nothing you could teach in a book or anything like that. But me having grown up in that element and being part of my instinct to who I am and as I play as a drummer, our rhythms are so complex a lot of times, that it&#39;s just instinctive and natural, and I listen to it, and I just copy what I hear. Become a Canon copier... Brother copier, and my mind copies what I hear, and I replicate it and I duplicate it, and elements in the mounts that is supposed to be done, or whatever verse, of course, whatever. I count the bars&mdash;I don&#39;t read&mdash;but I know how to count bars. And so, basically, it&#39;s not difficult for me; I just figure out the rhythms that&#39;s happening, and a little percolating rhythms underneath, on the snare, and just mimicking what I hear. It becomes more complicated when you try to get too scientific about it, and you confuse yourself, and then you have trouble getting it and learning it. But, basically, what we just do is we just listen to something, we copy it, we make it simple, and I just copy it to the best of my ability, and&mdash;it&#39;s natural for me, like I said, because New Orleans rhythms are complicated like that, and a lot of the hip-hop rhythms and hip-hop artists and songs have rhythms, and it&#39;s exactly like, or very, very similar to, or most like New Orleans type rhythms. So, I&#39;ve been doing that all my life. A lot of people haven&#39;t gotten to hear me play that because&mdash;on Billie Jean, I can&#39;t play that. It&#39;s a very simple 2 and 4. Madonna&#39;s music, I can&#39;t play that stuff, except for &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. Madonna&#39;s song &quot;Keep It Together&quot; I got to play a little more here. I played on that record, that album. Like I said, Prince played on that too, but I got to demonstrate some of the funky, syncopated hip-hop things that I kind of do, that feel and that style, and that bass drum rhythmatic thing that I do, and it&#39;s kind of syncopated in a hip hop kind of style. But that&#39;s been in my blood since I was young, since I was nine or ten. So, when hip-hop came out, and rapping and all that stuff came out, and New Jack Swing and all that, I was doing that since I was a little boy. That stuff was easy for me. So when they&#39;d program all that stuff, it&#39;s pretty easy for me because it&#39;s part of my nature and nuance of who I am and my character, spiritual character from my culture down in New Orleans. So, him working with the rap artists is right up my alley because seeing those rhythms that I&#39;m familiar with anyway. It&#39;s not difficult.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Christie Eliezer, music journalist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808114158im_/http://0101.nccdn.net/1_5/167/1c0/0b8/1222516464539800.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;HIStory Preview&rdquo;</span></a></span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Each night on their current &quot;HIStory&quot; tour, Michael Jackson and the band arrive at the venue in three limos during the local opening act&#39;s performance. Michael disappears into his sparse dressing room alone, pours a cup of steaming tea from a thermos, and puts on his stage costume--a gold/silver suit and a gold helmet.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">As he limbers up, his 5&#39;10&quot; body ripples with muscles. A strict macrobiotic diet, steady intake of vitamin pills, and rigorous dance rehearsal sessions, ensures it is nothing like the fragile flower portrayed in photos.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Behind a darkened area just behind the stage, the star joins the band and dances for a prayer. As they then clap hands and stomp their feet, Jackson yells, &quot;Whatever we play, it&#39;s gotta be funky!&quot; He and his five dancers are led into the rocket from which they will emerge onstage.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">The ten minute opening segment is awesome. An animated rocket which streaks through Earth on a giant screen &quot;lands&quot; on the stage with an explosion and a fire effects display. Jackson kicks open the door, takes two steps out, removes the helmet, and stares dramatically out at the crowd.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">A &quot;weightless&quot; dance sequence follows, to the strains of &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot; and an array of shooting lasers. The crowd, needless to say, goes berserk. This is a sequence many will remember forever, During the run-through of the classic hits, the accompanying effects and lighting are examples of how brilliantly Jackson understands stagecraft.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">He milks sentimentality while tearfully singing &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot;, before footage depicting him as a 10-year-old singing the song with The Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yet effects where he turns into a panther during Thriller and the trademark moonwalk during &quot;Billie Jean&quot; are as magical as they are dramatic.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">A wall is built onstage during &quot;Black or White&quot;, while a real tank and a soldier appear during &quot;Earth Song&quot;. A children&#39;s troupe and giant revolving globe emphasize the message of &quot;Heal the World&quot;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">The show finishes with kids crowding the stage waving the world&#39;s flags, and an exuberant fireworks display.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Royalty from four local provinces attended Jackson&#39;s recent Kuala Lumpur show. Local tradition has it that nobility remains at such functions for only 45 minutes. However, at the Sunday show, three princes stayed until the end of the concert.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Jackson flew into India, the same mix of fan hysteria, political manipulation reared its head. This time, 3,000 fans chanting outside Bombay airport, some had flown across the continent.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115058/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/australianewsstuff.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (October 3, 1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the lights dim and the &quot;go&quot; button is pressed at Michael Jackson&#39;s HIStory concert extravaganza, many in the audience instinctively reach for seat belts.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like the hi-tech, super-thrill virtual reality rides in the American theme parks, the concert is designed to challenge your point of gravity.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">It reflects Jackson&#39;s fascination with technology, his fertile imagination, and sense of wonderment, and his constant desire to push the envelope.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arriving on stage through a video delivery chute, Jackson clambers out of a spaceship dressed as a galactic stormtrooper and sears his audience with the abrasive &quot;Scream&quot;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is little let-up over the next 2 1/2 hour performance, filmed inserts and special effects are woven into an astonishing electronic tableaux.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is like a living video clip, with gangster shoot-outs, garish costumes, fireworks displays, flags of many nations, a giant wall built from 32 mock speaker cabinets, the inevitable parade of singing children, an ascent to the heavens for at least over the heads of the audiences in a cherry picker crane. David Copperfield-style disappearing acts, a dastardly torture chamber, a crack dance troupe, carefully orchestrated frantic fan run-ons and even a Gulf War tank!</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are moments when the action seems to be coming at you from every seems to be coming at you from every direction.
