Funk says he quickly sensed the media circus that was starting to form around the singer: &ldquo;Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s people called and practically begged me to sneak out a photo of Michael from rehearsals. I told Michael and we laughed about it &ndash; but the fact I told him built up a trust.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Subsequently, while on the Victory tour, Funk was given unprecedented access to the singer. One intimate photo taken by Funk captures Jackson applying his own makeup, something he took great pride in. &ldquo;Him and Jermaine [Jackson] loved putting on their own makeup,&rdquo; says the photographer, who adds that Michael became more and more interested in his appearance, more determined to look sharp, under the influence of such mentors as Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and James Brown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s make-up routine, adds Funk, was also a sign of the singer&rsquo;s gender fluidity: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t so much femininity on Michael&rsquo;s part as androgyny &ndash; he was fluid around gender. Michael had no interest in assigning a gender to anybody.&rdquo; At that moment, he recalls, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t overtly identify as one particular gender&rdquo;. However, when Jackson became a dad, his image changed to that &ldquo;of father&rdquo;, Funk says. &ldquo;He became a strong man in that sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808111749/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/tuf.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Tuf Mag&quot; magazine No. 8 (1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The new Jacksons album, &quot;Victory&quot;, and the &quot;Victory Tour&quot; are total group efforts, with each of the six brothers handling production, songwriting, and singing chorus, as well as technical responsibilities for the stage show. Michael Jackson is designing the set, lights, and numerous visual concepts. Jackie hired all the behind-the-scenes personnel. Marlon, Jermaine, Randy, and Tito picked the band members. Marlon handles stage pyrotechnics (&quot;He&#39;s in charge of blowing stuff up&quot;, says Jackie.) Randy schooled the guitar and drum roadies as well as checking out the enormous sound system daily. And Marlon, Michael, and Jackie created the choreography. In other words, The Jacksons, through their Jacksons Entertainment Corporation, are completely in control of every aspect of this tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103738/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/people84.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;People Weekly&quot; magazine (May 7, 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On April 16, in a North Hollywood rehearsal studio, Tito Jackson brother of you-know-who, presided over the first rehearsal of the musicians of the would-be backup band for the Jackson 1984 tour. The band--which includes guitarist David Williams, who played on Michael Jackson&#39;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album, and drummer Jonathan &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; Moffett, formerly of Lionel Richie&#39;s band--gathered, joked around a bit, and then began to jam, drifting naturally a familiar &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. Shortly after, the band began to roll. Tito caned them to order and laid down the law. &quot;We start at 7&quot;, he said. &quot;That means 7. You&#39;re not expected to come in carrying your instruments at 7 and be ready to play 15 minutes later.&quot; Long after Tito finished his instructions, Nelson Hayes, the Jacksons&#39; assistant coordinator, laid down another law. &quot;I&#39;ve been under contract with The Jacksons since 1981&quot;, he said, &quot;They don&#39;t like drugs.&quot; He paused for dramatic effect. &quot;Do anything like that on this tour, and you probably won&#39;t be with us by the time the tour is over.&quot; This is good news not because of the noble messages delivered by Tito and Hayes--though God knows, the presence of a little punctuality and sobriety in the world of pop music would be a welcome change of pace. No, the good news here is much simpler. Since the brothers&#39; album is already near completion and scheduled for release in June, there can be only one reason for the rehearsals: The Jacksons are getting ready to hit the road.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Estimates of the tour&#39;s fiduciary potential began at a stingy $20 million and escalated to a hyped $100 million. Not only would the our make the family much wealthier, but it would bring the boys back together. &quot;Michael has had very big success&quot;, says Tito, &quot;and sometimes the success of The Jacksons got undermined a bit. I think the tour is a chance for us to show our success, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newsweek.com/1984-michael-jackson-tour-207028"><span class="cs8567212B">Newsweek (July 15, 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After months of confusion, controversy and sporadic outbursts of popular hysteria, often fanned by frenzied media coverage, the Jacksons&#39; tour&mdash;billed as the most lucrative rock and roll roadshow ever mounted&mdash;was officially under way. The tour is currently scheduled to visit some 13 cities, with a few more sites yet to be announced. Most of the dates&mdash;perhaps nearly 50 in all&mdash;will be in large outdoor arenas like Arrowhead. The tour is expected to gross around $50 million&mdash;though estimates vary wildly&mdash;perhaps edging records set by the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Who. &quot;Even my mom talks about the concert,&quot; laughs Bob Case of Seattle radio station KUBE. &quot;This is going to be THE event of the next 10 years. It&#39;s like the Super Bowl&mdash;you don&#39;t care about who&#39;s playing, you just want to see it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In many cities, the Jacksons&#39; concert will climax months of feverish anticipation&mdash;and, in some cases, increasingly vocal complaints. Everyone had assumed that the tour would present complicated logistical and security problems&mdash;particularly since most preparations had been marred by byzantine, behind-the-scenes turmoil. Before last Thursday, when Michael announced new ticketing plans and the donation of his profits to charity, reports of greed and incompetence had outraged some fans and perhaps contributed to sluggish ticket sales in Dallas. But other fans loyally demonstrated their enthusiasm. In Kansas City, the hoopla began in June. When newspapers containing the first official ticket order forms rolled off the presses in the early hours of June 19, fans were lined up to buy them. &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous!&quot; said disc jockey Roy Leonard, who has been following the Jackson craze for the Chicago radio station WGN: &quot;People were stealing papers off other people&#39;s front lawns.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Big Brother: As every newspaper thief soon learned, Michael&#39;s show was no easy mark. Anxious fans were instructed to mail a money order (four tickets for $120), with no guarantee of a specific date, a good seat&mdash;or even any tickets at all. Despite the stiff price and chancey prospects (tickets were to be randomly distributed), customers in Kansas City jammed into post offices to buy money orders&mdash;15,000 in one day. Elsewhere in the country, civic leaders and local media petitioned Michael to make their city one of his stops. In staid Boston, the local tabloid sponsored a coupon drive that garnered over 30,000 signatures, and a radio station organized a rally of 5,000 fans, who milled about on Boston Common beneath an outsize billboard of Michael&mdash;a 25-year-old Wizard of Funk looking uncomfortably like Big Brother. In Jackson&#39;s native Gary, Ind., some 30,000 citizens petitioned Michael, at the behest of Mayor Richard Hatcher, to come home&mdash;at least for a ceremony. Even the president got into the act: when Jackson visited the White House last May, Ronald Reagan personally urged him to perform in Washington. Not to be outdone, presidential candidate Jesse Jackson made a point of meeting him last Saturday in Kansas City.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Such is the magic of America&#39;s newest Pied Piper of pop. The most explosive phenomenon since the Beatles, he defies easy categorization. Like James Brown, he&#39;s the pre-eminent black pop musician of his era, a master of soulful singing and impassioned stagecraft, able to dance with a furious precision that is innovative yet steeped in black tradition. Like the early Beatles, he&#39;s a master of upbeat musical confections, sometimes created in collaboration with the most popular ex-Beatle of all, Paul McCartney. Like Pat Boone, the prototype of rock teen idols, he&#39;s cute, wholesome and pious. He&#39;s a virtuoso of the modern recording studio; but like Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra, he aspires to be an old-fashioned entertainer. He&#39;s a stunning live performer, but also a notorious recluse with an otherworldly mystique&mdash;imagine Howard Hughes and E.T. rolled into one. Like Judy Garland or Johnny Ray, his appeal is freakish&mdash;he&#39;s utterly unlike you and me, with a streak of wildfire that unpredictably lights his eyes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Kansas City, first stop on the tour that now goes to Texas Stadium outside Dallas (July 13-15), the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla. (July 21-23), and Madison Square Garden in New York (Aug. 2-5), Michael presided over one of the gaudiest, most grandiose spectacles in the history of pop music. The show opened with a curious costume pageant involving large, lumbering pastel-colored Muppet-like monsters, a magically glowing sword, and a visored knight in shining armor&mdash;King Arthur meets Luke Skywalker. (The knight was Michael, of course.) There were lasers, strobe lights and smoke bombs. There was a spidery mechanical gizmo that nearly ate Michael. (He escaped.) There was magic, illusion, and fireworks&mdash;flares and explosives onstage during the show and in the sky overhead to end it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But it was the music, after all, that had brought the crowd here&mdash;and the smartly paced set included a little bit of everything. There was something old: the classic popcorn funk of &quot;I Want You Back,&quot; the Jackson 5&#39;s first Motown hit 15 years ago. There was somethlng new: four songs from &quot;Thriller,&quot; Michael&#39;s blockbuster solo album. Amid all the razzle-dazzle, there was even something blue: an earthy, extended gospel coda to &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot; sung by Michael a cappella&mdash;a touching reminder of his roots in the soul stylings of Jackie Wilson. Michael moved effortlessly from ballads (a luminous &quot;Human Nature&quot;) and rock (a ferocious &quot;Beat It&quot;) to skittish funk (the salsa-spiced &quot;Lovely One&quot;). On &quot;Working Day and Night,&quot; the group flashed some whirling dervish choreography, while by the show&#39;s finale, &quot;Shake Your Body,&quot; Michael had become a free-lance blur of spins, stops and body-popping turns. There was no material from the new Jacksons&#39; album, &quot;Victory,&quot;&mdash;perhaps because, disappointingly, it is such a spotty effort. Jermaine Jackson, a solo recording artist in his own right, did perform three of his songs; but he was in poor voice, and often seemed off pitch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wispiness: From start to close, there is only one real star of this show; it may be billed as a Jacksons&#39; tour, but it&#39;s Michael&#39;s all the way. When he sings a lachrymose ballad like &quot;She&#39;s Out of My Life,&quot; he makes sentimental tripe seem like honest passion. And when he performs &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; he seems to glide weightlessly. He dances with the breathtaking verve of his predecessor James Brown, the beguiling wispiness of Diana Ross, the ungainly pathos of Charlie Chaplin, the edgy joy of a man startled to be alive. The crowd gasps and screams, savoring not a fussy high-tech stage set but the grace and beauty of a brilliant entertainer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If all goes well, the Jacksons&#39; tour should only intensify the storm of coast-to-coast interest in the most famous Jackson of all. At Ron Smith&#39;s Celebrity Look-Alikes in Los Angeles, owner Smith reports that the craze&mdash;and the limited number of concerts&mdash;means booming business for his 20-odd hand-picked Michael Jackson clones. &quot;This reminds me of the Elvis Presley fad,&quot; says Smith. &quot;Only Jackson is bigger. It&#39;s like Marilyn Monroe, the Beatles.&quot; In Miami, bookstore owner Raquel Roque papered the front door of her Downtown Book Center with Jackson book jackets. &quot;The funny thing about him,&quot; says Roque, &quot;is that the younger the kids&mdash;four and five years old&mdash;the more they like him.&quot; All across the country, youngsters can purchase buttons, posters, a &quot;Thriller&quot; painters cap, key chains, duffel bags, bubblegum cards, a single white sequined glove, and even a Michael Jackson doll.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sit-In: Such accessories aren&#39;t taken lightly. When high-school officials in Bound Brook, N.J., tried to ban the glove last March, students staged a sit-in&mdash;and won a hearing over the right to continue wearing it. (They lost.) Or consider the case of Lillie Frierson, 13, of Los Angeles. Michael Jackson doesn&#39;t eat meat. Neither does Lillie. Michael sleeps on a mat on the floor. So did Lillie, until her mother ordered her back into bed. Michael wears beaded jackets. So does Lillie, a $350 red one that her mother, Doris, bought her for her birthday. &quot;I must be almost as crazy as she is,&quot; Doris sighs. &quot;I hope that nothing bad ever happens to him because if it does, that child is going to need to have help.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105434/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/rightingonn84.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Rock &amp; Soul&quot; magazine (August 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons are preparing a concert tour unlike anything the American concert stage has ever seen! A few months back, the Jacksons were all set to use a well-known staging- design company that has done amazing work for big name bands. Unknown to most people, Michael Jackson, in the meantime, had been formulating an imaginative concept for an elaborate production that involved much more than a backdrop, props, and special effects. Michael drew a series of simple sketches outlining his concept. The few who saw the storyboards found themselves in awe. The big-name designers were fired and a small crew was assembled to translate Michael&lsquo;s ideas into reality. Oddly enough, we&rsquo;re told that although the new, detailed blueprints drawn by the hired professionals are extraordinary. They don&#39;t even begin to reflect the scope or creative genius that Michael&#39;s original drawings suggested.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unlike most concerts, The Jacksons&#39; concert is not a random selection of the group&lsquo;s popular tunes. Every aspect of the show has been carefully calculated. We&lsquo;re told the presentation follows Michael&lsquo;s storyboards and is an epic! Oh, like a Broadway musical, we asked. No, we were corrected. It&#39;s an epic! No other details were revealed, because The Jacksons don&lsquo;t want their fans to come to the concerts with any preconceived ideas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fans around the country will witness the first live performances ever to feature all six Jackson brothers. Randy joined the group in 1975, when brother Jermaine left to pursue a solo career. Jermaine is back now, and so is Randy, Tito, Marlon, Jackie, and Michael. While the Jacksons have toured in recent years without him, Jermaine has not done any concerts on his own, although he came close to reuniting with his brothers during their 1981 concert tour. That prospect was nixed because of restrictive management decisions, so this new tour will be Jermaine&#39;s first concert appearance since his days with the original Jackson Five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All the brothers worked diligently preparing for this 1984 tour, meeting at Marlon&lsquo;s house several times a week. There, they&rsquo;d brainstorm without interruption from consultants or even their parents. Usually, the doors were closed to everyone outside the six brothers. Not even Don King or the Jacksons&#39; parents could penetrate this arrangement.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Each brother has been elected to take care of special responsibilities regarding the tour. Michael and Marlon, with a little help from Jackie, are in charge of the choreography. Marlon consults with the pyrotechnician and watches over the special effects. Marlon and Jermaine, but especially Tito, select the additional musicians, teach them the music and rehearse them. Jackie oversees all the behind-themes professionals the group has hired. Randy works with the drum and guitar roadies and goes to every soundcheck. In essence, however, all of the Jacksons are involved in every aspect of preparation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/blackbeat84sept.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Black Beat&quot; (September 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Meanwhile, back in Encino, California, Michael was dealing with the day-to-day running of his own musical empire, specifically, examining with eagle eyes, the second prototype of a doll created in his image. Apparently, that was just the problem--it *wasn&#39;t* quite in his image. For the company owning the coveted rights to manufacture and market the doll, it meant going back to the drawing board on Jackson&#39;s behalf for the third time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Despite any indications of spontaneous energy, the Jackson shows, certainly Michael&#39;s choreography, are planned totally, right down to the last breath. But, according to one musician in the camp, &quot;I never even saw Michael until we were several weeks into rehearsals. Jermaine was there, because he had to learn the bass guitar parts to the songs, but the other guys didn&#39;t come through until later.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The stage, a virtual tribute to modern rock &#39;n&#39; roll tour technology, may carve its own bit of history from this event. Reportedly, the Jacksons, as of this writing, were considering marketing a scale model of the stage as a toy, in the same fashion the Star Wars characters and toys were peddled&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank Dileo, MIchael&rsquo;s manager, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13015497/hit-man"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Nashville Scene&rdquo; (November 22, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826212831/https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13015497/hit-man"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Out of the record-label frying pan, into the megastar-management fire.
