I had never done that before--ever! It gives such a spontaneous feeling and reminds me of when R&amp;B first started in the south and all the blacks would just get together in a shack and jam. So much feeling. That&#39;s what&#39;s missing today. Everything is so commercial and mechanical.

Temperton, from UK seaside town Cleethorpes, is responsible for some of the singer&rsquo;s greatest hits, including &lsquo;Off the Wall&rsquo; and &lsquo;Starlight&rsquo;, (which would later become Thriller), offers a fascinating insight into his methods. &lsquo;I did no real homework apart from listening to The Jackson Five&rsquo;s records. But I decided I&rsquo;d write two or three tunes in order to give Quincy and Michael a choice when I took them to LA. When I listened to the records, the one thing I noticed straight away about Michael&rsquo;s timbre was that he always sat on top of the beat and really pushed it along and gave it an electric energy. So I figured that for the main song I would write for him I would try to write a strong [metro] nome which had a lot of short lyrics in it, allowing him to drive that beat along. The other thing that I noticed about Michael, which was a paradox, was that he had very strong Temperton goes on to explain that in order for the songs to have the correct impact, they must be something which the artists can relate to. In Jackson&rsquo;s case he recalls his thinking behind the track &lsquo;Off the Wall.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;With all of the artists, I have to try to understand them so that they can sing the songs from the heart. When I met Michael, we talked about his love of movies and Hollywood and when I came up with that lyric, it was a phrase that was used in New York a lot at the time. What I made of the meaning of the lyric was he was a little bit off-centre &ndash; and when you look at Michael, there was a little bit of eccentricity there that gave him an amazing energy. So I thought it was a fun idea to write a song with the lyric, &lsquo;Off the Wall&rsquo;.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/michael-jackson-s-studio-men-lift-the-king-of-pop-s-mask-1.608702"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The National&rdquo; (Abu Dhabi) (September 25, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200225232143/https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/michael-jackson-s-studio-men-lift-the-king-of-pop-s-mask-1.608702"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He always sat on top of the beat and really pushed it along and gave it a lot of melody,&rdquo; described the British songwriter Rod Temperton, responsible for penning classic tunes including Rock with You, Off the Wall and Thriller. &ldquo;Writing for him, I knew he loved songs with a strong melody with a lot of short notes in it. The other thing I noticed about Michael is that he loved a lot of vocal harmonies on the song, so that was something I included. I always tried to make the words melt into the melody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Quincy asked JR if he would be interested in doing some overdubs on another album he was recording and JR agreed, little knowing the import of what lay ahead when he took his drums down to the studio that day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With no idea that he was about to make history, JR took his battered Gretsch kit down to Allen Zentz Recording Studio. &quot;It was down behind where Record Plant is now in Hollywood, off Santa Monica Boulevard&quot;, remembers JR. &quot;It was not a huge room and it had an old Harrison console. The tracking room was not wide, but it was more rectangular. The drums would be straight on the right corner, and it had this engraved wood pattern on the wall behind it for sound diffusion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We brought my drums down to the studio on a Thursday and it was just me, Quincy was in the booth, and Bruce Swedien the engineer, and I believe Michael was in there&quot;, says JR. &quot;They put the first song up, which was &#39;Girlfriend&#39; by Paul McCartney. I got my licks and I nailed it. They said, &#39;Do you want to do another song?&#39; I said, &#39;Sure&#39;. So, they put up a David Foster, Carol Sager tune called &#39;It&#39;s the Falling in Love&#39; and I nailed that, so I got both things done in about three hours. I could see them talking behind the glass, and they go, &#39;What are you doing Monday?&#39; I said, &#39;Nothing.&#39; They said, &#39;Do you want to come back and record the rest of the record?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Monday, JR returned to the studio and met Greg Phillinganes, a top session musician who would go on to play keyboards for Michael and become his touring Musical Director. Together, they put &quot;Don&#39;t Stop &#39;Til You Get Enough&quot; onto tape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I remember right as we cut it, the feeling that went through me knowing we had just cut a Number One record,&quot; says JR. &quot;It&#39;s an interesting feeling. Sometimes you know you&#39;re playing on a piece of crap and other times, you know that you&#39;re making history in the present. It&#39;s amazing, Michael was there and he was ecstatic.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Off the Wall&quot; was recorded over a four-month period, according to JR. &quot;They had big budgets. It was a beautiful time in the record industry&quot;, he says. &quot;Everybody was coming out of the &#39;70s, there was this dance vibe that groups like the Bee Gees had already set the bar really high with. Quincy would be like our coach. It would be me and Greg Phillinganes and Bobby Watson on bass or Louis Johnson, and the late David Williams on guitar and generally it was that team. Quincy would bring in guys like Michael Boddrick or Ian Underwood doing synth, but I&#39;d never see those guys. It would always just be the four principals. Quincy would sit us down and say, &#39;Listen, I know you guys are used to making records, but I want 10 hits.&#39; We&#39;d all look at each other and go, &#39;Well, okay!&#39; So, that&#39;s what would happen.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;John Robinson&#39;s set-up for the &quot;Off the Wall&quot; session was an old Gretsch kit that he bought in Boston in 1975. &quot;It was a 22&quot; x 14&quot; kick drum, the toms were 12&quot; and 13&quot; standard and a 16&quot; x 16&quot; floor tom. I ended up selling that kit to the Hard Rock&quot;, says JR. The selection of drums and sounds was &quot;more on me than Michael or Quincy. I think the nice thing about why they wanted me there for the whole process was that if I had something to say, I said it. With different sonic situations that was more involved with Bruce Swedien, being the engineer and Quincy&#39;s right hand man for years, since Dinah Washington and all the stuff they did. Bruce is probably the senior engineer on the planet...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In keeping with the Gretsch kit that had some serious miles on the clock, the rest of JR&#39;s gear had been around the block and back again. &quot;I had some raggedy old Zildjian hi-hats that had been beaten up from the Berklee days&quot;, says JR. &quot;I remember Quincy came up and said, &#39;The hats, man, when you open them up, they don&#39;t sound like they are opening up.&#39; I said, &#39;Well, this is really all I have right now.&#39; Bruce Swedien ended up asking me for those hi-hats, so I gave them to Bruce after &#39;Off the Wall&#39;. They were very dry and very used.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Barry White, singer, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough - BBC Radio 2 40th Birthday Special&rdquo; (August 29, 1998), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He didn&rsquo;t understand why nobody wanted him to record &ldquo;Off the Wall&rdquo; by himself. And I told Michael, &ldquo;Never let any man or woman be the deciding factor in your creativity. Because once you give in to that you will become a slave to it.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
