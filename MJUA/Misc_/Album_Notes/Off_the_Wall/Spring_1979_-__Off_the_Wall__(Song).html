After cutting the rhythm tracks Temperton returned to New York, where he completed the lyrics, before flying back to Los Angeles the following weekend to record vocals with Michael. Background vocals were recorded on the Saturday afternoon, and the three lead vocals were done the next day&hellip; The three songs Temperton submitted for the album, &lsquo;Off the Wall&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rock With You&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burn This Disco Out&rsquo;, are all disco themed.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rod Temperton, songwriter, Geoff Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson: A Life In Music&rdquo; (2010) and Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The one I thought would be their choice was &ldquo;Off The Wall&rdquo;. I tried to find out about Michael&rsquo;s character. I knew he loved Charlie Chaplin and I thought &ldquo;Off The Wall&rdquo; was a nice thing&hellip; that was the &ldquo;A&rdquo; song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/nightlife/features/47895-the-making-of-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Time Out&rdquo; (Abu Dhabi) (December 24, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200225225950/https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/nightlife/features/47895-the-making-of-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Temperton [explains] that in order for the songs to have the correct impact, they must be something which the artists can relate to. In Jackson&rsquo;s case he recalls his thinking behind the track &lsquo;Off the Wall.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;With all of the artists, I have to try to understand them so that they can sing the songs from the heart. When I met Michael, we talked about his love of movies and Hollywood and when I came up with that lyric, it was a phrase that was used in New York a lot at the time. What I made of the meaning of the lyric was he was a little bit off-centre &ndash; and when you look at Michael, there was a little bit of eccentricity there that gave him an amazing energy. So I thought it was a fun idea to write a song with the lyric, &lsquo;Off the Wall&rsquo;.&rsquo;</span></p></body>
