But it&rsquo;s not work like slavery.

Greg set up a prepared electric piano with the timbre of a perfect acoustic one, to knock out any lingering echo. The lyrical theme was similar to &ldquo;The Things I Do for You&rdquo; from Destiny, but since this was a refinement of something I&rsquo;d said earlier, I wanted to keep it simple and let the music put the song over the top.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson, drummer, Mike Smallcombe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As with &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop&rsquo;, Michael again contributed to the percussion sounds, as did John Robinson. &nbsp;&ldquo;When we did the percussion for &lsquo;Workin&rsquo; Day and Night&rsquo;, I used a really old wine bottle,&rdquo; the drummer recalls. &ldquo;The sun was shining through the studio and it was a great session. So there we were, using this old wine bottle, but the fucking thing shattered on me. Michael was there, and when he saw what happened, he just said in his voice, &lsquo;Oh J.R.! Let me help!&rsquo; There he was, picking all this glass off my arms, bit by bit. Soon after, Bruce [Swedien] came marching in, and with his deep voice, he was like, &lsquo;What the hell&rsquo;s going on in there?!&rsquo; It was a funny moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One unusual twist in the making of the album involved Michael asking JR to bring in some wine bottles they could use as percussion. &quot;We&#39;d discuss the size of the wine bottles. Not Napa Valley wine bottles, but kind of trashy big bottles&quot;, explains JR.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One day I brought some stuff in and he and I went into a small recording room together. It was very surreal. It was late in the afternoon with the sun shining through the window. The song was &#39;Working Day and Night&#39;. We both had our wine bottles and some striking tools. It was a small room and both of us were playing different rhythm patterns and it was smoking. About halfway through, my wine bottle shatters all over my left arm. We stop and Bruce and Quincy want to know what&#39;s going on and Michael goes, &quot;Oh, JR!&quot;, and he starts picking the wine glass out of my arm. It was something that any friend would do, that&#39;s how I remember it.&quot;</span></p></body>
