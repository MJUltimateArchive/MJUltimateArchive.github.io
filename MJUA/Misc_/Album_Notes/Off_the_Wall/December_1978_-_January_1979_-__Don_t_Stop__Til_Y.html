It was also unusual because of my vocal arrangement. On that cut I sing in overdubs as a kind of group. I wrote myself a high part, one that my solo voice couldn&rsquo;t carry on its own, to fit in with the music I was hearing in my head, so I let the arrangement take over from the singing. Q&rsquo;s fade at the end was amazing, with guitars chopping like kalimbas, the African thumb pianos. That song means a lot to me because it was the first song I wrote as a whole. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough&rdquo; was my first big chance, and it went straight to number one. It was the song that won me my first Grammy. Quincy had the confidence in me to encourage me to go into the studio by myself, which I appreciated. Then he added strings, which put icing on the cake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Sheila E., percussionist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/sheila-e-on-her-glamorous-life-upcoming-album-and-future-collaborations-64505792/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Smithsonian&rdquo; magazine (May 16, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180123202244/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/sheila-e-on-her-glamorous-life-upcoming-album-and-future-collaborations-64505792/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;On Michael Jackson&rsquo;s album, the first one that he did, &ldquo;Off the Wall,&rdquo; he wanted me to come in and play this sound and to emulate it the only thing that I could think of was to get two water bottles, like two Perrier water bottles.
