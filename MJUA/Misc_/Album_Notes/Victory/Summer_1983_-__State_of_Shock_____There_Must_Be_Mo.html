Mercury was invited to work with Michael at Hayvenhurst, and over a six-hour session they came up with three songs, which also included &lsquo;There Must Be More to Life Than This&rsquo;. Michael later called Mercury to schedule a studio session so they could complete &lsquo;State of Shock&rsquo; for Victory, but arranging a second session proved difficult for both artists. &ldquo;They were great songs, but the problem was time &ndash; as we were both very busy at that period,&rdquo; Mercury said. &ldquo;We never seemed to be in the same country long enough to actually finish anything completely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mick Jagger &ndash; also a client of John Branca and recommended by the attorney &ndash; sang &lsquo;State of Shock&rsquo; with Michael instead. &ldquo;It was a shame, but ultimately a song is a song,&rdquo; Mercury said. &ldquo;As long as the friendship is there, that&rsquo;s what matters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Peter Freestone, Freddie Mercury&rsquo;s personal assistant, &quot;Freddie Mercury:An Intimate Memoir&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael invited Freddie to Hayvenhurst in the summer of 1983 and took Freddie and Peter on a tour of the estate. They visited Michael&#39;s bedroom, which shocked Freddie when he saw that Michael&#39;s bed was a mattress. Michael said that he preferred &quot;to be closer to the earth&quot;, to which Freddie replied &quot;But you&#39;re on the first floor!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What impressed Freddie was that Michael had his triple platinum disc award for &quot;Thriller&quot; just leaning against the wall. Freddies thought it showed great style.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Freddie wasn&#39;t a show off, as he also used his gold and platinum awards as wall coverings than trophies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the studio, Michael and Freddie were the only ones with Freddie on the piano and Freestone playing &quot;the toilet door&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They recorded 3 songs, &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;State Of Shock&quot;, and &quot;There Must Be More To Life Than This&quot;. On &quot;Victory&quot;, there was no drummer or drums, and Michael wasn&#39;t fond of the sound the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">drum machine gave so Freestone ended up slamming the bathroom door for 5 minutes in the rhythm. &quot;On There Must Be More To Life Than This&quot;, Michael ended up composing his own lyrics as he went along. They worked for about 5 or 6 hours and ended at 6 pm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the car, Freddie said to Freestone he admired Michael&#39;s creativity, but question his style in decorating the house</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two split the songs, with Freddie recording &quot;There Must Be More To Life Than This&quot; for his</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">album &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;, and Michael re-recorded &quot;State Of Shock&quot; with Mick Jagger. Victory remains unreleased.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://montreuxmusic.com/mmm/content/view/192/244/lang,english/"><span class="cs8567212B">Montreux Music</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100115163830/http://montreuxmusic.com/mmm/content/view/192/244/lang,english/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Freddie had been invited to Michael&rsquo;s house in Encino, just north of Hollywood. We arrived at the house, having passed a security tower at the gate. We got out of the car at a mock Tudor mansion, bricks at the lower level, and white stucco and wooden beams above. Michael came to greet us with a big smile, obviously proud of his house. Before we could go in, he insisted we accompany him on a tour of the grounds. I will never forget Freddie Mercury walking through mud, wearing white jeans and white tennis shoes, talking to llamas! We were shown all the animals and taken down to a pond where Michael had swans. Michael had a real love for these animals and birds; they were part of &lsquo;his family&rsquo;, as Freddie&rsquo;s friends were part of his.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael took us into the house. I don&rsquo;t know how many rooms there were in it. I do know that Michael lived there with his mother, Katherine, his two sisters, Latoya and Janet, and there were rooms for guests should anybody stay over. As we entered Michael&rsquo;s bedroom, I was struck by three things, that gave an insight to Michael.. All around the room, on the floor were his gold and platinum awards for &lsquo;Thriller&rsquo;. They obviously meant a lot to him, he kept them close, but he didn&rsquo;t need to show them to the world, he didn&rsquo;t need to show everybody how good he was. The second thing was the large terrarium along one wall containing his snake. Much had been made in the press about this favorite creature, and he was in Michael&#39;s room, but under heavy planks of wood kept in place with many bricks. He may have been a &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, but kept very securely. Third and last was- in the middle of the room was a king-size mattress on the floor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Freddie asked Michael &ldquo;where is the bed? You have enough money to buy one!&rdquo; Michael&rsquo;s reply &ldquo;when I sleep I like to sleep close to the earth&rdquo;,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;But we are up on the first floor!&rdquo; retorted Freddie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We were shown through many rooms including a film room which had a vast library of films where I watched one, while Freddie and Michael worked, joined by Janet. Another wonderful situation was when Freddie was in the toilet, Michael took me to his video games room and we played the early version of table tennis. There were two players, one black and the other white. We started playing and Michael was the one who pointed out that we were playing the opposite colors &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playing the white and you&rsquo;re playing the black!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the way to the studio at the back of the ground floor we were taken through the kitchen where we were introduced to Katherine, Michael&rsquo;s mother. She was very kind and hospitable. When Freddie asked for an ashtray, she produced a jam jar lid, as no one in the house smoked!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The work comprised of a Michael track, &lsquo;State of Shock&rsquo;, which only needed another vocal, which Freddie happily provided. When they had finished it really only needed mixing, but sadly after this session time was the enemy and Freddie and Michael never had free time together, so Michael got Mick Jagger to put his vocal on this and it was released in this form.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next was a Freddie piece he was just working on at this time. There was a piano tune and Freddie had come up with a few words. Freddie sat at the piano and let Michael try the singing. Where there were no words written Freddie told Michael to ad-lib, which he did with words about love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael then ordered in some food for us all. There were these large platters of cold meats, salads, bread, and fruit. We started in, but Michael wouldn&rsquo;t touch any as he was a strict vegetarian at the time and would only have food made by his mother.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Work was started on a third track with a working title &lsquo;Victory&rsquo;. There was only one technician in the studio. There were no instruments set up and no musicians. Freddie and Michael worked in much the same way. At the start of a track they need a drum track to keep the beat, and then they add music and instruments to this. Michael had a clever idea for the bass drum beat. He and Freddie were in the control room with the technician and I spent 5 minutes banging a toilet door in perfect time!! Somewhere in Michael&rsquo;s vaults there is a tape of me!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The studio was a place of work for both Freddie and Michael, but watching them you could also imagine two children in a play room. Both of them would throw their hands in the air and burst out laughing when either of them made a mistake, but it really was a serious business too. Thinking back now to this time watching these two masters of their craft were together in one place putting this music together, gives me goose bumps.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Who was Michael Jackson for me? I met a beautiful young man. He and Freddie had much in common. He was confident, and already an incredible musician and performer. He was a resourceful technician and a considerate human being. He never once treated me any differently than he did Freddie. He thought of others in situations even though it might have had nothing to do with him. In the few conversations I had with him, I got the impression that he had few friends. He was working almost all of the time and had many professional connexions and associates. &nbsp;Maybe he was already a bit lonely, having to have so much security at that early age, and having to resort to bringing indoors the entertainment anyone else his age could go out for. He was only 3 years younger than me, but still hadn&rsquo;t grown up! He still wanted so many of the simple things in life to bring him happiness, but did find some peace with his animals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/freddie-mercury-roasted-michael-jackson-sleeping-floor-mansion-just-not-keep-mouth-shut-10970391/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Metro&rdquo; (October 23, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191028161447/https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/freddie-mercury-roasted-michael-jackson-sleeping-floor-mansion-just-not-keep-mouth-shut-10970391/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The music icons spent days together working on new music at Jackson&rsquo;s home studio in Encino, California in 1983 and developed a close friendship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fans have heard snippets over the years of what really happened inside those four walls, including from Freddie himself. But one man who was there to witness it all was Freddie&rsquo;s personal assistant, Peter &lsquo;Phoebe&rsquo; Freestone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Peter worked for Queen and Freddie for 12 years, right up until the musician&rsquo;s death in 1991.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to the former PA, hanging out with two of the biggest superstars in the world didn&rsquo;t feel out of the ordinary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Peter told Metro.co.uk: &lsquo;You accept people how they are. For example, with Michael Jackson, Freddie and I went to his house to record for eight hours one day. This was back in 1983, and Freddie and Michael collaborated on three different tracks at that point.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;But Michael didn&rsquo;t treat me any differently than he treated Freddie. It was just the way people are. Michael and I played video games for half an hour while Freddie was outside smoking.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to Peter, Michael later took him and Freddie on a tour of the house, situated on Encino&rsquo;s Hayvenhurst Avenue. When they got upstairs, Freddie couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes when he saw a mattress on the middle of the floor of the king of pop&rsquo;s million-dollar mansion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Freddie just could not keep his mouth shut because right in the middle of the floor, was this big mattress made up as a bed,&rsquo; Peter recalled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Freddie said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got money why don&rsquo;t you buy a bed?&rdquo; And Michael just said, &ldquo;I feel so much better when I&rsquo;m closer to the Earth&rdquo;. Freddie said, &ldquo;Well how much closer does not having a bed make you? We&rsquo;re upstairs&rdquo;.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Peter added: &lsquo;That was the sort of thing that happened.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not many are privy to the inner workings of two music icons in the studio, and it&rsquo;s an experience Peter is able to recall in minute detail, even after all these years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s actually amazing to see two amazing talents working off each other,&rsquo; he revealed. &lsquo;Basically Michael had a track ready, which was called State of Shock, which he wanted Freddie to put his voice on, so he did.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Then they worked on a track of Freddie&rsquo;s, which was There Must Be More To Life Than This, that he was working on for a Queen album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;But the thing is, there was hardly any words or anything. So a lot of the time Michael was ad-libbing putting his own words in. In fact, there was a third track. The combination of the two of them, but just being there while they were feeding off each other.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Peter continued: &lsquo;Each of them were just giving out everything they could to create something and to be present at that sort of thing is amazing. The same happened with David Bowie with Under Pressure for Queen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;To be present when you have&hellip; it&rsquo;s almost like electricity. Then you feel tension in the air and there&rsquo;s that o-zone smell. It&rsquo;s almost like that.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;State of Shock&rdquo;:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/07/16/jacko-before-went-wacko-giving-orders-to-mick-jagger-what-depressed-him-most.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Fox News&rdquo; (July 16, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He had Mick doing scales for over an hour to warm-up before he would even start,&quot; said Swedien.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So was the &quot;Rolling Stones&quot; bad boy too happy about it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Let&rsquo;s just say he did it,&quot; Swedien responded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.gainesville.com/news/20090627/ocala-sound-engineer-saw-jackson-at-his-best"><span class="cs8567212B">Gainesville article</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Mick didn&#39;t hesitate,&quot; said Bruce Swedien...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;By then, everyone knew how good Michael was,&quot; he continued. &quot;If Michael Jackson says warm up, you warm up - even if you are Mick Jagger.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&quot;There Must Be More To Life Than This&quot;:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">William Orbit, producer of 2014 mix, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a609289/william-orbit-talks-queen-forever-it-pulled-me-back-from-the-desert/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Digital Spy&rdquo; (November 11, 2014)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200331165939/https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a609289/william-orbit-talks-queen-forever-it-pulled-me-back-from-the-desert/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[The demo] was ever so rudimentary. It was basically Freddie hitting the piano - studios in those days didn&#39;t have separation - so he&#39;s banging out the piano and then overdubbed some beautiful harmonies. He must&#39;ve spent an awful lot of time. Michael Jackson, I think, came in and did a take and you can hear Freddie on the multi-track calling out &#39;The bridge here&#39;, &#39;The repeat chorus&#39; and everything like that. Clearly, Jackson&#39;s involvement was brief and thereby technically a challenge in the audio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then there was the dynamic between the two artists. Do you have them sing line, line, line, line, or do you have them sing verses? It was collective by the way - there was a lot of debate amongst myself, Brian and Roger - but whether we made the right choice over how we presented the singers, there was a lot of debate. We didn&#39;t have as many options as people might think. &#39;Why don&#39;t you have that bit there?&#39; and I don&#39;t like to say it, but maybe we didn&#39;t have it. It was recorded in a throwaway way over 30 years ago. It was quite a jigsaw puzzle. Fortunately, Queen have got their own engineers and they helped me out. The quality of their people right across the board was awesomely amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of three songs Michael worked on with Queen&rsquo;s Freddie Mercury, and recorded by Michael with Freddie on piano, in the summer of 1983 for the Jacksons album, VICTORY &ndash; Michael composed some of his own lyrics as the 5-6 hour session progressed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Song first considered for release on Queen&rsquo;s 1982 album, HOT SPACE &ndash; it failed to make the group&rsquo;s 1984 album, THE WORKS, as well.
