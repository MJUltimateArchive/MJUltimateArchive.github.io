Unfortunately, radio stations in the States, because &lsquo;Ben&rsquo; itself was about a rat, decided not to play it, saying that it lacked taste or something. The fact is that people probably couldn&rsquo;t care less, since hardly any of them knew what the song was about initially. The charts proved that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Moonwalk&rdquo; autobiography (1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Ben&rdquo; meant a lot to me. Nothing had ever excited me as much as going to the studio to put my voice on film. I had a great time. Later, when the movie came out, I&rsquo;d go to the theater and wait until the end when the credits would flash on, and it would say, &ldquo; &lsquo;Ben&rsquo; sung by Michael Jackson.&rdquo; I was really impressed by that. I loved the song and loved the story. Actually, the story was a lot like E.T. It was about a boy who befriended a rat. People didn&rsquo;t understand the boy&rsquo;s love for this little creature. He was dying of some disease and his only true friend was Ben, the leader of the rats in the city where they lived. A lot of people thought the movie was a bit odd, but I was not one of them. The song went to number one and is still a favorite of mine. I have always loved animals and I enjoy reading about them and seeing movies in which they&rsquo;re featured.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Walter Scharf, songwriter, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110647/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/musician1984.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Musician&rdquo; magazine (July 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Walter Scharf, the Oscar-winning film composer who wrote the music for Michael&rsquo;s hit &ldquo;Ben&rdquo;, recalls the thirteen-year-old as &ldquo;meticulous about everything, almost to a fault.
