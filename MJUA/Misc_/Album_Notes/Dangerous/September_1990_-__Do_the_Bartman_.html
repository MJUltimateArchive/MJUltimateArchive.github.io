But, the harmonies in the chorus are performed by the two of us. We are each, singing each part harmony. We did them simultaneously. It was a quick, and painless process. I mixed the record, and I promise you all the vocals are equal gain. That&rsquo;s two people, and it&rsquo;s tight! It was really cool for me, as I&rsquo;d never so easily before doubled with someone doing background vocals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/someone-just-paid-38-5k-to-own-100-of-a-michael-jackson-song/"><span class="cs8567212B">Music Business Worldwide</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The story of the song and its creation has been a thorn in my side since I did it. But, despite Matt Groening&rsquo;s repeated confessions, I am the sole writer of the song. While it&rsquo;s true, along with me, Michael Jackson does sing backing vocals. And it WAS his idea to call the song, DTB. AND, he did insist I include his name in the lyric. Hence, &ldquo;If you can do the Bart, you&rsquo;re bad like Michael Jackson.&rdquo; And so, obviously, he was involved. Perhaps this tidbit of info is not as sensational as saying MJ co-wrote the song, but I assure you, he did not.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Nancy Cartwright, voice of Bart Simpson for &ldquo;Do The Bartman&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Life As A Ten Year-Old Boy&rdquo; autobiography</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So what do you give someone who already has everything? What do you buy for a guy who is worth an estimated $450 million? What kind of thing do you purchase for the oldest &quot;boy&quot; in the world? What sort of present do you give to the first solo artist to generate four Top-Ten hits on the Billboard charts on one album, seven top hits on another album and five number-one hits on yet another album? What do you give to a man who doesn&#39;t really want anything, except to be accepted? What do you give to Michael Jackson? It took days to figure out. Flashback to earlier this week. Yeardley and I were meeting with producer John Boylan at Lion&#39;s Share to find out what key we sang in. He also played some sample cute from our new Simpsons CD, &#39;Simpsons Sing The Blues&#39;, that had been recorded by some studio singer. Good singers. It was the first time I got to hear Yeardley&#39;s voice. Wow! So sweet and pure...just perfect for &quot;God Bless the Child.&quot; Me? I&#39;m okay, but Bart Rocks! We were jammin&#39; to the sample of &quot;Do the Bartman&quot; when John leans over and says, &quot;I won&#39;t be directing you on this one.&quot; &quot;Oh, bummer!&quot; I replied. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he went on. &quot;Some guy named Michael&#39;s gonna lead you.&quot; It took a few seconds for the penny to drop and my jaw quickly followed. Michael?! I raced to the nearest mall. A set of sunglasses? A T-shirt? A nice tie? Jesus! Something more personal. I raced and rummaged ever closet. My trumpet? Never! That neglig&eacute;e? A family photo? I had to think of something. I don&#39;t know why. just had to. Then, as I dug deeper into my collection I heard the strangest thing. Little Lucy, all of nine months, got her finger in the string of a talking Bart doll and I heard my own altered voice say, &quot;Eat my shorts.&quot; Problem solved. I have about ten of these dolls and besides the &quot;shorts&quot; line it voices about five other expressions that have been incorporated into our American vernacular. Pretty sad. The vernacular, not the doll. The doll is actually kinda cute. His proportions are very real and the hard plastic head is big and yellow and his eyes bug out. Very Bart. I fugured this might be just the perfect gift for the guy who has everything. Standing in the lobby, the front door opens and in he walks. He had on his sunglasses and was a little taller than I had imagined. Jim was right there and shook his hand and said a few things, welcoming him and all. Then, Michael turned to me. I had the doll behind my back because I wanted to surprise him. I had signed the doll&#39;s belly and written &quot;Bart loves Michael&quot; on the front of his T-shirt. Just as we finished our greetings, I pulled the doll out from behind and handed it to him, saying,&quot;This is from me to you.&quot; He just about had a heart attack! His eyes lit up like a six-year-old&#39;s and he took it and hugged it. &quot;Omygod, he really is a kid!&quot; He thanked me profusely and, from that moment on, I knew we were going to have a great time. We went into the studio and began the rehearsal for &quot;Do the Bartman.&quot; Michael was absolutely incredible. We had so much fun. It didn&#39;t take us very long at all because he knew exactly what he was doing. We started at the top and just ran through it a couple of times and he couldn&#39;t stop laughing. He absolutely loved Bart and when I spoke like him, Michael was delighted...like a kid at Christmas. At one point in the song, there was plenty of room for adlibbing. I went nuts. I added this one toward the end, &quot;Eat your heart out, Michael,&quot; and he loved that! I hope it stays. We finished and he gave me a copy and gave me a hug. And then I went out to the very cozy living room and had a little lunch. Oh, and by the way, those dolls? I found them on sale at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us for $10 apiece. They retailed at $30. I snatched them all, it was such a deal. Hey, you never know when you might run into Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bart Stevens, assistant engineer / backing vocals, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/irvings-bart-stevens-will-share-his-michael-jackson-stories-at-old-red-museum-of-dallas-county-history-and-culture-10813108"><span class="cs8567212B">Dallas Observer (June 20, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stevens also discusses the time when recording sessions for </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dangerous</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> stopped so the pop culture zeitgeist single &ldquo;Do the Bartman&rdquo; could be cut.

Pay no attention to those premature reports.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yes, the Gloved One has been approached about singing with the Animated One. But no, it is not a done deal. Which is why the recent stories about Jackson doing a duet with Bart Simpson have infuriated the folks over at Fox Broadcasting Co.&#39;s hit cartoon show.Especially perturbed is &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening, who plops down at a West Hollywood recording studio and grants a speedy interview about the latest project to come from America&#39;s favorite dysfunctional family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s so frustrating,&quot; says the cartoonist. &quot;I said to a reporter a while ago that I would like to have this happen and it was printed as if it was true.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What Groening wished for was Jackson&#39;s participation in &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues,&quot; an incongruous title for the debut album of an overnight success story. What Groening is afraid of is that all the publicity will send the obsessively media-shy Jackson scurrying from negotiations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This may kill it,&quot; Groening says. &quot;We have a whole wish list of people we&#39;d like to use on the album. Stevie Ray Vaughan was lined up, then he was killed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Milling around the recording studio this day are the actors who provide the voices for &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is Julie Kavner, whose scratchy vocals come out of Marge&#39;s animated mouth and Dan Castellaneta, who talks for the long-suffering dad, Homer. Sitting nearby is Yeardley Smith, the voice of the high-minded daughter, Lisa. Nancy Cartwright, nursing a cold and chugging Evian water, drops in and out of Bart&#39;s unmistakable whining monotone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The four performers have been working on &quot;The Simpsons Sings the Blues&quot; for about a month. So far, they have completed only two rough cuts in between taping shows for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; fall season, which begins Oct. 13.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Due out in November, the disc contains an eclectic mix of old blues tunes such as Billie Holliday&#39;s &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; and original songs such as &quot;Deep, Deep Trouble,&quot; produced by rapper D.J. Jazzy Jeff and written by Groening.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fox has been trying to keep the record under wraps until negotiations with performers like Jackson are nailed down. But word has leaked out, to the great consternation of those involved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s duet was to come on &quot;Do the Bartman,&quot; and published reports have said it was penned by Jackson. It wasn&#39;t, which prompted producer and filmmaker James L. Brooks to issue a press release late last week apologizing for any misunderstanding about who actually wrote the tune. The composer is Jackson pal Bryan Loren.</span></p></body>
