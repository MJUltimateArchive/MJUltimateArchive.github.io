Riley created the music track for a song called &lsquo;She Drives Me Wild&rsquo; using sounds from sample CDs he owned, and Michael wrote the lyrics around the music.&rdquo; (Mike Smallcombe, &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;); the recording date ranges for those tracks were ~January-March 1991 and March-May 1991 respectively.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Teddy Riley, co-writer, producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MusicRadar&rdquo; (July 3, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190725222801/https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My biggest memory from that recording was that we used all car sounds as drum sounds and it came out perfectly. I didn&#39;t go out into the field and record actual car sounds and take back to the studio &ndash; I had a sample CD that was really cool. It wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d done before; it was the first time I went for unusual sounds in the place of drums.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/u_ZoJ6lkKAE"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Red Bull Music Academy Festival New York 2017&rdquo; Interview</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://nyc.redbullmusicacademy.com/events/new-jack-swing-a-conversation-with-teddy-riley"><span class="cs8567212B">May 5, 2017</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That really blew him away, which was &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;, because he started hearing car sounds, fire trucks, and I made this song out of car sounds, vehicle sounds. No real drums, and all he heard was [mouths beats of the song] and and he couldn&#39;t help to come in that room and say, &quot;What is this?&quot;</span></p></body>
