I think he recaptured that sound on this song. You know, I think he went back to his roots of recording with this song to record an incredible track. I thought it would take someone like Quincy Jones [who produced Dirty Diana] to really put an incredible track like that together. I thought it would take someone like Quincy to get that sound, but Michael came up with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was really difficult for me having to follow in Quincy Jones&#39; footsteps. He left big footsteps! He did hear this album and he really gave me a great compliment on my production. He heard it before it was released and he said this was a masterpiece, and that it&#39;s ready to come out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was taking so long and he brought Quincy in to hear it &ndash; he was like a quality controller for Michael. If Michael had the chance he&#39;d keep working on songs forever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael took so long to complete the song that he called in Quincy Jones to listen to it, as what Teddy Riley called:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;A type of quality controller.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brad Buxer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Brad_Buxer_Interview_(Black_%26_White,_November/December_2009)"><span class="cs8567212B">Black &amp; White Magazine interview (translation by SegaLoco)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: One of the great successes of Dangerous is Who Is It. But the structure of this song reminds many Billie Jean. Was this conscious on the part of Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No, I do not think so. I never really paid attention but now that you say is true, Who Is It and Billie Jean are very close. However, despite all the qualities of Who Is It, I do not think it comes close to Billie Jean. No song is better than Billie Jean, I think &hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: In the studio, Michael gave you a lot of freedom?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Absolutely. Michael was not one of rigid, it was always open to my suggestions and ideas. He gave me full confidence... Sometimes, he knew exactly what he wanted to hear me sing all the parts of a song. Other times, he let me play until he hears something he likes. This is particularly what happened to songs like &quot;Who Is It&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stranger In Moscow&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
