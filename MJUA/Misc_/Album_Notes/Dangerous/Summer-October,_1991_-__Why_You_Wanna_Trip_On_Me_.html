We anticipated that. That&#39;s why we wrote songs like &#39;Trippin&#39; [&#39;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&#39;] and &#39;Jam.&#39; We know that people are after him, people are talking about him. But we didn&#39;t get too direct, we didn&#39;t say anybody&#39;s name. &#39;Cause when you&#39;re too direct, it gets boring.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MusicRadar&rdquo; (July 3, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190430072603/https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The element I&#39;m most proud of in this song is my guitar playing.

I was using an acoustic Ovation guitar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The whole song didn&#39;t take long to produce, actually. I think the longest part was writing everything and getting everything formatted. There&#39;s no studio trickery either, really. When you&#39;re doing analogue it&#39;s pretty much, you know, getting everything on tape, you know? It&#39;s very warm. That&#39;s basically it.</span></p></body>
