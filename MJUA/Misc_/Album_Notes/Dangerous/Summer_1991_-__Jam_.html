Michael felt they weren&rsquo;t &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo; enough and wanted Riley to update the sounds.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Teddy Riley, co-writer, producer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jam was a track that Michael had the idea for. He told me to see what I could do with it so I took it and created some more instruments and reproduced the record &ndash; and he loved it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s the way it worked a lot of the time. He&#39;d come in with an idea and I&#39;d flesh it out in the studio. He bought it to me as a DAT, and he told me there were things he wanted done, and I did them. It was my idea to get the rapper Heavy D to perform on there as well. He was Michael&#39;s favorite rapper at the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/u_ZoJ6lkKAE"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Red Bull Music Academy Festival New York 2017&rdquo; Interview</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://nyc.redbullmusicacademy.com/events/new-jack-swing-a-conversation-with-teddy-riley"><span class="cs8567212B">May 5, 2017</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He made it a point for me to go and listen to how he had &quot;Jam&quot; before I get to it. He said, &quot;I really, really need you to hear this record. I don&#39;t know what to do with it.&quot; But do y&#39;all know that Michael created &quot;Jam&quot; on the drum machine, himself, and had an MPC in the back, and he said, &quot;You got to here this record.&quot; So, he played this record, [mouths beat of &quot;Jam&quot;] but it had nothing else, just a beat, and he&#39;s like, &quot;What&#39;d you think?&quot; I said, &quot;This is crazy. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do, but I know I want to be a part.&quot; He says, &quot;You are. You&#39;re gonna take the drum machine and you&#39;re gonna work on this&quot;, &#39;cause I was working on all these beats, and he was loving all these beats, and he&#39;s like, &quot;So, this may kick &#39;Jam&#39; out.&quot; So, that&#39;s why he gave me &quot;Jam&quot;. And when I took &quot;Jam&quot;, I was just sitting there analyzing, how and what I&#39;m going to do, and what could I add to really take this where it needs to go. And I started adding the horns, and all the crazy stuff, and all the villain stuff. And he&#39;s like, &quot;This is brilliant. Now I gotta go back in and rewrite.&quot; And that&#39;s how we were making the records. We were passing them back and forth</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Heavy D, rapper, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110320/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/vibe1995.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; magazine (June/July 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was in California the first time I heard Michael Jackson wanted to record with me. I was, like, Nah, no way, he&rsquo;s too big, it can&rsquo;t be true. Then I got a call from Michael&rsquo;s people at my hotel telling me he was interested. But I still wasn&rsquo;t believing it&mdash;I thought they were setting me up for a TV practical jokes show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So me and my partner go to the place, and while we were waiting we were talking and cursing up a storm&mdash;I was thinking that if it was a blooper show, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to use it. Then Michael called and said he was on his way. When he got there he was just, like, &quot;Hey, how ya doin?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s just as regular as everyone else. We talked about all the normal stuff guys talk about. He&rsquo;s real smart. People forget that he&rsquo;s the most incredible entertainer we&#39;ve seen in our lifetime. His name is Michael Jackson, not Super Michael Jackson. He makes mistakes just like all of us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My favorite Michael Jackson song is &ldquo;Music and Me.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an old one, about him and his music, his love for music, and the time they&rsquo;ve had together. It&rsquo;s like a song that would be sung to a girl, but it&rsquo;s all about music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brad Sundberg, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.facebook.com/inthestudiowithmj/posts/838232206350675:0"><span class="cs8567212B">Facebook post (November 28, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rene was Bruce Swedien&#39;s songwriter/arranger. Rene was the Rene from Rene and Angela - an 80&#39;s R&amp;B duo. He was funny could fly on an MPC-60 - Bruce&#39;s drum machine of choice. Bruce and I had recorded hundreds of acoustic drums into his MPC, so his sounds were incredible, and Rene was a master at creating great grooves. Can you say &quot;Jam&quot;?</span></p></body>
