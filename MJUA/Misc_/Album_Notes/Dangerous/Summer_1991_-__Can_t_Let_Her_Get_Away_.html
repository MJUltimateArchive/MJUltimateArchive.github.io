I made the sample CD myself &ndash; that was me playing instruments, then looping them up and having them lying around for potential projects. Back then I just had them lying around and I hadn&#39;t used them&hellip; But I really wanted to use them!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout the album I was drawing off a lot of CDs I had hanging around, all played by myself.
