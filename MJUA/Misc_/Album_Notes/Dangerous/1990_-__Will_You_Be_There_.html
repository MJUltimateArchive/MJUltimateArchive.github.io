I didn&#39;t think about it hard. I always feel that it&#39;s done from above. I feel fortunate for being that instrument through which music flows. I&#39;m just the source through which it comes. I can&#39;t take credit for it because it&#39;s God&#39;s work.

Bringing a vocal choir in on the track was a stroke of genius. It&#39;s something I&#39;d consider doing since hearing him do it. It&#39;s a long song as well, a lot of this album really clocks in. This nearly hits eight minutes, I think &ndash; it&#39;s not a punchy radio edit! Yes, it&#39;s long but it came across really well for the album. A lot of the songs on the album are long. That&#39;s what makes the album I think.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bart Stevens, assistant engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/irvings-bart-stevens-will-share-his-michael-jackson-stories-at-old-red-museum-of-dallas-county-history-and-culture-10813108"><span class="cs8567212B">Dallas Observer (June 20, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stevens also recalls the creation of the song &ldquo;Will You Be There&rdquo; in the studio.
