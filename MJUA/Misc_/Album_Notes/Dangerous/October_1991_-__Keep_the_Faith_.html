He was upset because the song he had been trying to sing was in the wrong key. &quot;The day had come for Michael to put the lead on &#39;Keep the Faith,&#39; &quot; says Swedien. &quot;He sang the first and second verses, and then he disappeared. It was very unlike Michael. I found him standing in the corner of his office crying his eyes out. He was absolutely heartbroken, cut to the quick.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I told him, &#39;Michael, it&#39;s not that big a deal,&#39; &quot; Swedien says. &quot; &#39;I&#39;ll just record it in the other key.&#39; We&#39;d tried two keys and, unfortunately, picked the wrong one. He was really upset. I told him, &#39;Michael, we&#39;ve got to face this right now.&#39; I called the synth player and programmer. I felt we had to get the right key and get Michael to face it before it turned into something ugly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I thought we&#39;d have a major, major problem,&quot; continues Swedien. &quot;I was visualizing headlines. I told him, &#39;Pull yourself together, face this now.&#39; And it was late. I said, &#39;We&#39;re not going home until you&#39;ve sung this all the way through. Then we&#39;ll go home and be able to sleep and continue.&#39; That was scary. But he did it. He pulled himself together. We went in the studio, cut a whole new demo and recorded a scratch vocal all way through. A situation like that could have been a real block. We didn&#39;t leave studio till dawn.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Teddy Riley, producer (not for this song), <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/michael-jackson-recording-dangerous-with-teddy-riley-211776"><span class="cs8567212B">MusicRadar (July 3, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I really admire the work that went into this track. Anything Michael does, I can admire. It doesn&#39;t really remind you of any of his other songs; this one&#39;s a bit different to his usual tracks but it stands out. Michael&#39;s always innovative. With this track, I just think he went another way due to the structure of the track and the instruments used. Well, that and him working with Glen Ballard with the writing on it &ndash; they kind of went head-on with that track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Glen Ballard, co-writer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/1268569/music-industry-remembers-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Billboard&rdquo; (July 2, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191126220243/https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/1268569/music-industry-remembers-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was at Record One studio in Sherman Oaks writing a song with Michael and Siedah Garrett.
