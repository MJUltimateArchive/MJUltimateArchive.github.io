Michael returned to California at the behest of Tohme, who felt he should be closer to the centre of the concert industry. All musical equipment was brought over from Las Vegas, and Michael continued to work on music in the hotel with engineer Michael Durham Prince. Here, vocals were recorded for the pre-existing tracks &lsquo;I Am a Loser&rsquo;, which became &lsquo;I Was the Loser&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Best of Joy&rsquo;. They were the final vocals Michael recorded in his lifetime. &ldquo;Although we continued to work on music for a few more months, that was the last time that he truly sang,&rdquo; Prince said.</span></p></body>
