Yeats called, &ldquo;The Mask.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was talking about a very impersonal, socially controlled society, a future technological era, and the mask represented that immobile, unemotional state,&rdquo; Mosdell says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Japanese electro-pop band, Yellow Magic Orchestra, liked the lyrics. One of Japan&rsquo;s biggest stars, Ryuichi Sakamoto, wrote the melody line and the band launched the song in the late &rsquo;70s, Mosdell says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On a trip to Japan, musician Quincy Jones heard the song and introduced it to Jackson, thinking it would fit the album they were producing. Jackson agreed, adding more lyrics and music, transforming the song from a techno classic into a dance-funk soundtrack, Mosdell says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When Michael Jackson took it, it made it into a love song, kind of, about a woman,&rdquo; Mosdell says. &ldquo;It was a completely different premise to me, but hey, it&rsquo;s Michael Jackson. I let him have that one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, the evolution complicated copyright issues. As Mosdell recalls, he agreed to divide the royalty share equally with Jackson and Sakamoto. But this apparently did not sit well with the management of the Yellow Magic Orchestra, Mosdell says, &ldquo;and after further discussion, and disagreement, the song was taken off &lsquo;Thriller.&#39;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It retained a kind of mystique for the last 25 to 30 years. Everyone knows about it and knows that it was recorded for (&lsquo;Thriller&rsquo;) but was taken off,&rdquo; Mosdell says. &ldquo;This created a subculture history behind it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Pulse&rdquo; magazine (2012), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I wrote a totally new version with Michael&rsquo;s genre in mind, invigorating the emotion and instead of &ldquo;Is it me, is it you behind the mask, I ask?&rdquo; I made it &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;him&rdquo; that now stands. Michael obviously just &ldquo;tweaked&rdquo; my original lyrical verse to fit the new version. Michael wrote a total new melody line.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mosdell bizarrely admitted he didn&rsquo;t know who Michael was when he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who Michael Jackson was &ndash; I wasn&rsquo;t into that whole soul disco stuff&rdquo;, confessed Chris Mosdell. &ldquo;When Michael Jackson recorded it, he also added an extra melody line and a few extra lyrics, so they wanted to split the royalties &ndash; which is quite impossible. You can&rsquo;t take a Beatles song and add a melody line, a few more lyrics, and ask for fifty per cent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the end Michael&rsquo;s version, described by Sakamoto in an interview with Ryan Wicks in November 2012 as &ldquo;Michael singing over Yellow Magic Orchestra&rsquo;s original instrumental track,&rdquo; was shelved due to publishing rights. Sakamoto said Michael&rsquo;s representation wanted, quite unfairly wanted to control 100% of publishing rights.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Shanice Wilson, background vocals, &ldquo;Black Star News&rdquo; (November 18, 2010) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170414033306/http://www.blackstarnews.com/entertainment/music/shanice-behind-the-mask-with-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shanice had difficulty holding back tears in attempts to sing the song. &nbsp;&ldquo;As soon as the music came on and I heard Michael&rsquo;s voice, I would start to cry.&rdquo; But the seasoned professional got it done with the support of others around her. John Nettlesby, for instance, who contributed to production of the vocals, eased the pain by chatting and sharing fun stories about Michael throughout the recording session.</span></p></body>
