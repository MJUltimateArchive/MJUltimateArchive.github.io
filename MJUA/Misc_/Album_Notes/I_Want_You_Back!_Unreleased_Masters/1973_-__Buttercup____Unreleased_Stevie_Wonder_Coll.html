They&#39;re the most famous superstar songwriting team to come since David Bowie and John Lennon got together to write &quot;Fame&quot; some years ago. What many fans don&#39;t know, however, is that long before he ever met McCartney, Michael was part of another superstar collaboration--resulting in an album that has never been released.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It all came about back in the old days when Michael hooked up with another child-star, his close friend. Stevie Wonder.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That album has some incredible stuff on it&quot;, Michael remembers. &quot;I don&#39;t really know the reason why Motown holds it. t think they&#39;re just waiting until later to put it out and do some numbers with it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In those early days, before Michael had made his mark as a songwriter &nbsp;with such hits as &quot;Don&#39;t Stop &#39;Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, it was Little Stevie who was the songwriting phenomenon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How the Songs Happen</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The way he comes up with a song is just incredible&quot;, Michael marvels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;A song comes about in millions of ways--it can take half an hour or half a year--but he comes up with songs just like this.&quot; (Michael snaps his fingers). &quot;He&#39;ll be fooling around, teasing you, and then write a song on the spot. I&#39;ve seen him do it lots of times, and you&#39;re just amazed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Obviously, the teaming was influential in the songwriting development &nbsp;of young Michael, who admits, &quot;I would say I&#39;ve learned more from him than anybody.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One trait the two music makers have in common is a strong sense of perfectionism. &quot;Stevie&#39;s never satisfied with anything&quot;. Michael points out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;ll do a track forever, that&#39;s why it takes him four or five years to do an album. I&#39;ll never get over him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I wish those songs could have been released back then,&quot; he sighs. &quot;But they still could be released now and be #1--God--for a long time...&quot;</span></p></body>
