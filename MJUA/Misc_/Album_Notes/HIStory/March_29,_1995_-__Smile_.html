I remember we were in the studio, and I came up with the idea at the end of the song to have the piano sound old, like in an old movie theater, with the sound slowly disappearing. Michael told me it would work magically with the short film he had planned for the song. He would walk away from the camera just like Charlie Chaplin did at the end of his movies. He loved Chaplin, said he saw a lot of himself in him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rob Hoffman, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4325168&amp;postcount=14"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Gearslutz&rdquo; forum (June 27, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190822160956/https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4325168&amp;postcount=14"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the recording of &quot;Smile&quot; on HIStory, Bruce thought it would be great if Michael would sing live with The Orchestra. But of course, we didn&#39;t tell the players that. We set him up in a vocal booth off to the side. They rehearsed a bit without vocals in, then during the first take Michael sang, just about knocked them out of their chairs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Scheduled for release as a single in the UK/ Europe and other countries (not including the USA), as the last single from DANGEROUS, in December 1997 &ndash; release cancelled, against Michael&rsquo;s wishes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Promo copies with shortened version issued, some featuring a rare and highly sought after picture sleeve depicting Michael dressed as Charlie Chaplin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Promo short film, including footage of Charlie Chaplin, believed to have been shot &ndash; remains unreleased.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael would be disguised in the character of the Tramp and a young boy as the Kid.
