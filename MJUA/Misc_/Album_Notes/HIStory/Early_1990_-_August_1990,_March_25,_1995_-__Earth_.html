And I was feeling so much pain and so much suffering of the plight of the Planet Earth. And for me, uhm, this is Earth&#39;s Song, because I think nature is trying so hard to compensate for man&#39;s mismanagement of the Earth. And with the ecological unbalance going on, and a lot of the, uh, problems in the environment, I think earth feels... feels the pain, and she has wounds, and it&#39;s about some of the joys of the planet as well. But this is my chance to pretty much let people hear the voice of the planet. And this is &quot;Earth Song&quot;. And that&#39;s what inspired it. And it just suddenly dropped into my lap when I was in... on tour in Austria.</span></p></body>
