But Michael was not afraid to cut orchestra, despite the costs involved. In the end, he cut my orchestra as well, and replaced the orchestra parts with keyboard.&rdquo; The music box intro was created by Rob Hoffman and fellow engineer Andrew Scheps. &ldquo;We bought a bunch of music boxes, tore them apart and created a sample set,&rdquo; Hoffman said. &ldquo;Brad Buxer then played the part in the intro. A little girl [Markita Prescott] was called in to hum the melody of the music box.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Opens with the Pie Jesu segment of Maurice Durufle&rsquo;s Requiem OP. 9, conducted by Robert Shaw and performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorus. Little girl&rsquo;s voice at the beginning belonged to Markita Prescott. Little Susie was originally recorded with orchestra and arranged by Geoff Grace. Steve Porcaro re-did it again later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was one of five songs hand-written by Michael around 1979 - lyrics included in a personal notebook, with young actor Mark Lester on the cover.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several stories have emerged over the years on what inspired Michael to write the song. One version was that it was written about a young girl who was murdered in 1972.The Bridge of Sighs, by Thomas Hood, was also talked about as being an inspiration for the lyrics. Another popular story was that &lsquo;Little Susie&rsquo; was based on a painting by Gottfried Helnwein called &lsquo;Beautiful Victim.&rsquo; The artwork for it appeared in the HISTORY booklet in 1995.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Brad Sundberg has said at his well received Michael Jackson In The Studio seminars that it was actually written about the Holocaust.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ryan Arnold, assistant audio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">Reddit AMA (April 25, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit user: What was it like working with Michael in general? Many people have said that he&#39;s the most kind and fair boss you could ever have and that&#39;s exactly how I&#39;m imagining him as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ryan Arnold: It was hard to gauge him most of the time, but he seemed very full of energy. When we were talking about Little Susie, I remember him randomly saying, &quot;Hey stand like this,&quot; and he pointed his toes inward. I gave him a look of confusion and mimicked him. &quot;Now do this,&quot; he said while making a face. Then he broke out in hysterics laughing. Apparently, I&#39;d just made a face at one of the marketing executives for the albums inside the studio&#39;s lobby. That guy shook his head like he thought I was dirt, but Michael just kept laughing, and before long, so was I. You know, it was a nice break, because I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve never been to New York City, but everyone&#39;s super serious and not very nice at times. It was a nice change of pace.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: How did [&ldquo;Little Susie&rdquo;] get created and what did Michael think of the final product?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Michael had difficulty composing what exactly it was he wanted with the song. It sounded too much like Basszouille haha. That&#39;s why it kept getting shoved off the schedule until eventually being dropped.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m not sure what he thought of it since it was supposedly finished in LA, but he explained to me it was a personal song about a little girl that was actually murdered, which was the greatest sin to him, and he had to sing his feelings, even if it was 20 something years later.</span></p></body>
