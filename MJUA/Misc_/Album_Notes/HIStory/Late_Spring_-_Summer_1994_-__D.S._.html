The only concession Michael would make to the Sony attorneys is to allow them to change Tom Sneddon&rsquo;s name to Dom Sheldon, the initials to which became the song&rsquo;s title. Bruce Swedien brought in musician Larry Williams to play a guitar solo on &lsquo;D.S.&rsquo;. &ldquo;They flew me to New York, and I played my solo, and they then kept me there until Michael heard it and signed it off,&rdquo; Williams recalls. &ldquo;This took a month. Michael would be out of town or doing some other stuff and I was being paid $ 2,000 a day just to sit there and wait for Michael to hear the solo!&rdquo; In the end, a solo by Guns &rsquo;N&rsquo; Roses guitarist Slash was used instead. &ldquo;I remember Slash coming in,&rdquo; Williams recalls. &ldquo;Put it this way, there was a lot of Jack Daniels and a lot of cigarettes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Slash, guitarist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104437/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article16.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; magazine (August 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: How does Jackson work?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Slash: With Michael, the initial tracks that I get to play on are completely bare of vocals, usually just some drums and a little bit of bass, so it&#39;s hard to even know what key the song&#39;s in. So, I just make up a bunch of stuff and they pick what they want. I did one thing, two things a day, and then they&#39;d say all right, we&#39;ll call you back tomorrow. They wouldn&#39;t call me back for three months. All of a sudden, I&#39;d get this phone call out of the blue--can you come back?--so I&#39;d come back and then they&#39;d say, OK, we&#39;ll call you tomorrow. And then three months would go by... I guess I&#39;m on two songs on his new record. I don&#39;t know which the songs are, though. I haven&#39;t even heard them yet. That&#39;s how it is working with Michael. It&#39;s a mystery.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ryan Arnold, assistant audio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">Reddit AMA (April 25, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: What was it like to work on [&ldquo;D.S.&rdquo;]?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ryan Arnold: There were a lot of in-jokes about the lyrics, which were actually referring to a certain district attorney.
