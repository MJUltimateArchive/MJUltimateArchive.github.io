You&rsquo;re pressured timewise, but not by creativity or money. So you&rsquo;re left with mad freedom. You&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d be very controlling, but if he likes you enough to work with you, he wants your expertise, not just another Michael Jackson record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Heal the World&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stranger in Moscow&rdquo; from the HIStory record are, like, the makeup of Michael. I think he&rsquo;s taken on the responsibility to make changes in the world. He&rsquo;s the only real superhero.

But, like many of the King of Pop&rsquo;s new tunes, it does reflect his stormy life. &rdquo;Everything on Michael&rsquo;s mind is on the album &mdash; positive and negative,&rdquo; explains Jam.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jackson seems unfettered by media attention. &rdquo;He gets around. He&rsquo;s not at all a recluse,&rdquo; insists Jam. Jackson&rsquo;s favorite haunt last winter, while recording in Jam&rsquo;s home base of Minneapolis, was the Mall of America, the grande dame of indoor shopping centers, which he visited almost daily in a fake mustache and hat. &rdquo;He&rsquo;d always go at peak times,&rdquo; recalls Jam, &rdquo;because he said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s when everybody&rsquo;s having fun.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.themortonreport.com/entertainment/music/an-interview-with-jimmy-jam-of-the-original-7ven-part-two/"><span class="cs8567212B">The Morton Report</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was great too, working with Prince and working with Michael, they were polar opposites in the way they worked. Prince would walk in the studio at the beginning of the day and he&rsquo;d walk out with &ldquo;1999,&rdquo; done. Michael, we&rsquo;d spend a day just on the volume of the handclaps. I mean, literally. And we&rsquo;d turn them up and he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll come back tomorrow and we&rsquo;ll listen to it again.&rdquo; We come back the next day, and he&rsquo;d go, &ldquo;Can we turn that up just a little more?&rdquo; Yes, we turn it up. &ldquo;Okay, make me a tape.&rdquo; Okay. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back tomorrow and we&rsquo;ll listen again.&rdquo; I mean, it was literally like that. But that was, you know, learning from people like Quincy Jones, people who were very meticulous about what they did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">What was Michael like on a personal level?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was married to Lisa Marie Presley at the time we were working with him. And I remember my wife asking Lisa what attracted her to Michael. She looked at my wife and just said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the kindest man I&rsquo;ve ever known.&rdquo; And I remember thinking the same thing after working with him. Just a nice dude.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That reminds me, we used to get into these big, long conversations. And Michael would pick my brain about stuff, always curious about everything. He said to me, &ldquo;Jimmy, how do you want to be remembered?&rdquo; I asked him what he meant. &ldquo;When people talk about you after you&rsquo;re gone, how do you want to be remembered?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;I want to be remembered as a nice guy.&rdquo; Michael goes, &ldquo;No, I mean, as a producer, how many number one songs,&rdquo; you know, whatever, whatever. I just said, &ldquo;Michael, those are statistics. I don&rsquo;t want someone to say &lsquo;Oh yeah, that Jimmy Jam, he had a bunch of number one hits.&rsquo; I just want them to say, &lsquo;Jimmy Jam, he was a nice guy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fast forward about a year later. We needed to get a sample cleared and he was the only one who could clear it. I ended up having to call him directly. I said, &ldquo;Michael, how are you?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good. I know you wanted to ask me something, but before that, can I just tell you something?&rdquo; I said sure. He said, &ldquo;Remember what you said about how you want to be remembered?&rdquo; I said yes. &ldquo;Well, every time someone asks me about you, I just say, &lsquo;Jimmy Jam, he&rsquo;s the nicest guy.&rsquo;&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Great! You get it now, Michael?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I totally get it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the end of the day, after all the talent and all the groundbreaking stuff he did, he was just simply a nice guy. He was one of the nicest people I&rsquo;ve met and worked with ever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110320/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/vibe1995.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; magazine (June/July 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s the most intense person I&rsquo;ve worked with. For him, everything is about the music and how to make it better. He also makes work a lot of fun. He&rsquo;s a kid at heart&mdash;his office is not like a normal office. He has all the kids&#39; toys. A lot of times we&#39;d be in session, in the middle of playing a video game, and he&rsquo;d be, like, &ldquo;Well, we got to do this. But go ahead and finish your game, though&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to mess your game up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The thing about Michael is his talent. If you put Michael onstage without the explosions and the other dancers, he&#39;ll still command the stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&rsquo;s a song called &ldquo;Childhood&rdquo; on the new album, and I think for the first time, Michael has put a lot of his feelings on record. That song, for right now, defines where he&rsquo;s at&mdash;the way he feels about himself and the way people feel about him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104437/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article16.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; magazine (August 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What made Michael Jackson the world&#39;s most popular musical star of the &#39;80s and early &#39;90s, maybe of all time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jimmy Jam: He&#39;s immensely talented, a fantastic singer. He also makes people around him better. I think he inspires people. And nobody works harder than him. When people started getting tired, he would go, OK, but we just need to do this a little bit better. He was constantly pushing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Q: How was the mood in the Jackson camp?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jimmy Jam: I thought his mood was great. Making music is the most important thing in his life and I found him very happy and very relieved and very joyous to be in the studio. I saw his joy at doing what he enjoys, which is music. For us, it was wonderful to watch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Q: Were you surprised by how personal the LP turned out?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jimmy Jam: &quot;Scream&quot; was obviously very personal, but the album was very personal overall. I always think an artist&#39;s best record is when they use the gift of music to tell what&#39;s on their mind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough - BBC Radio 2 40th Birthday Special&rdquo; (August 29, 1998), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I mean the hours that he worked in the studio were so long. When people would start getting tired, he would be the one to go, &ldquo;Okay now, but we just need to do this a little better and we can do this better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Glew, Epic Records chairman, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104437/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article16.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; magazine (August 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David Glew: The record was going to be all his hits and five new tracks. Michael came to us last fall and said, David, I would like to continue to record, and we had heard several of the songs at that time and what we heard was fantastic. He was in such a good mood and spirit that he continued to record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Q: Were you surprised by how personal the LP turned out?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Glew: No, not surprised.

I think this was a time when Jackson was in great spirits, filled with piss and vinegar (excuse my French). It reflected in his songwriting at the studio. I can think of a couple examples that compare and contrast with one another. As I mentioned above, some songs were already written at earlier points, like with Tabloid Junkie, so there wasn&#39;t too much beyond contemporary refinement going on with those.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: What did impress you the most while working with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: The lightheartedness of his work ethic. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever encountered anyone so laid back while so professional at the same time. His sister was a lot like that, but perhaps a bit more up tight and colder to the help.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Could you describe an &quot;average&quot; day?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: I&#39;m not sure what an average day would be. As an audio engineer, and not always the assistant engineer, my job was to do things purely technical to help achieve the sounds necessary. So, for example, a lot of the time I had to help explain what Michael had to do with the vectors on the synth to get the sound he wanted. If we weren&#39;t getting the proper amount of natural reverberation between whatever mics we were using (often dual SM7s), it was my job to adjust the acoustics.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Did MJ ever mess around on the piano before finalising a bassline or were they always pre prepared and he just hummed them? Or did he ever play them on the piano to show the session musicians?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Michael was always on various synths, sometimes with the Grand Piano preset open. I&#39;m pretty sure he did not compose basslines on that setting, but I&#39;m fairly sure he did mess around with a lot of bass settings (and vectors) on the Korg Wavestation. I think Jimmy ended up taking one like that from him for D.S., but didn&#39;t up using the Wavestation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Are there any songs that didn&rsquo;t make the &ldquo;HIStory&rdquo; album that you wished did?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Yes actually. I didn&#39;t hear many tracks that were cut, but two stuck out to me. Basszouille, which had circus vibes in an orchestral type way. It sounds a lot like Little Susie because the texture of instruments is the same. Another was a cover of Tom Jones&rsquo; Delilah, but funky with a swingbeat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Tell us more about the song Basszouille. It sounds great!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: The best way I can phrase it is, imagine the song Circus Girl, the Thriller outtake, but played with the instruments on Little Susie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: What synthesizers/effect modules did you guys use, or were you that focused on getting a lot of hardware, or just using what you had available/lying around?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Well, we had just about every synth we wanted available to us. If you have a specific song in mind that I listed, I can tell you what was used. The album had a huge budget and the studio was practically rented out for a month straight, so what Michael wanted, Michael got.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Was he more on a shy or confident side?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: He was definitely more shy, at least I think until he was comfortable around you. Some people he never was though. I&#39;m not entirely sure how comfortable he was around me, but based on how he messed with me outside, I would like to think a bit or so. There was also a demanding side to him if people were screwing up constantly. I remember an intern kept costing us time by messing up the ambiance, at which point Michael said, &quot;Do it right or don&#39;t do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: I know MJ often mumbled lyrics just for melody but how many potential full songs that are &quot;complete&quot; or very near complete do you suspect MJ really left stashed in the vault for the future of posthumous releases...?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: A lot more than the Estate likes to say. I know this from just working with various producers. There&#39;s a whole slew of material with Babyface and Puff Daddy that no one ever talks about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Michael&rsquo;s speaking voice? So many people have talked about how his speaking voice was much deeper than they expected or heard on TV, but I can&rsquo;t seem to find a definitive answer about if it was like an on/off switch, or if it was kind of a mix of both.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: It sounded kind of feminine at times, but then on other occasions when he was more snappy, deeper and less breathy. But yes, it was a bit different than most TV recordings would have you believe. The same applies to his sister Janet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Were you surprised at any small things that were completely different from you had expected based on his image in the media?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Yeah, I think I was most surprised that he was eccentric as they portrayed him, but without all of the bad things. In 1994, you expect Michael Jackson to be this drug addicted criminal, circus freak type of a person because of how the media hated him and chose to drive that sort of narrative down people&#39;s throats, but he wasn&#39;t a drug addict, he was too clear and concise in what he wanted, he wasn&#39;t a circus freak, and he was very empathetic and able to communicate like the rest of us, if not better. He looked different, though that didn&#39;t seem to stop the ladies, and some men, but that was really it. If he didn&#39;t have that skin condition, I don&#39;t think the media would have been so hard on him, it really is illuminating how racist the media is, and really NYC, because I could tell a lot of stories of racism from that city.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Ehm, if it&rsquo;s not really personal, can you please elaborate on &ldquo;though that didn&rsquo;t seem to stop the ladies, and some men, but that was really it.&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: In the 90s, despite the negative reception to his appearance, a lot of women found him attractive, as well as some homosexual men. A few times the front of the studio was crowded with them and we had to call the police.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Was it always his intention to bring in guest appearances ? (Biggie, Shaquille) or was that a decision made spontaneously? How was it decided?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Yes, as far as I know&hellip; Michael was always talking about collaborations and who he wanted, many of whom never came to be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Did Michael ever bring any sources of inspiration? Books, music, artwork to give him inspiration for the sessions? Or did he refer to any particular artist he looked up to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Yeah, Michael brought in some stuff from time time. I remember at one point, he brought in a Bible, and quoted something Jesus said about children, and said, &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Was it easy to work with him? Was he demanding? Understanding? Complaining? Happy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Michael could be any of those things haha, he was a person like you and me!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Based on your experience what are ingredients to the Michael Jackson sound and feel of the music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Have an idea, focus on one particular thing about it and build the song around it. Sometimes it would be a hook or bassline, and he would expand upon it with a myriad of ideas, which was my job to help him achieve! Well, mine and a couple others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Christopher &ldquo;Tricky&rdquo; Stewart, mixed &ldquo;Slave to the Rhythm&rdquo; (2010 leak), <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.vibe.com/2011/06/tricky-stewart-speaks-his-michael-jackson-experience"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (June 25, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190708192005/https://www.vibe.com/2011/06/tricky-stewart-speaks-his-michael-jackson-experience"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met Michael years and years ago in the early 90s like 1993. And one day he was working at a studio and he was about to block the studio for a couple weeks. I was running over and he and teddy riley were trying to kick me out because I was working all night. At that time he would have a bunch of video games to create the vibe and he caught me playing one of his pacman games and he was like you know you&#39;re playing my game right? laughs. There&rsquo;s no mistaking that voice. I turn around and there he was. he was just kidding though, real cool. it was just amazing to be in his presence, it was a dream come true. Everyone who&rsquo;s ever done music has wanted to do something with Michael Jackson. I believe he was the number one call in all of music for pretty much all of his career. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">it was quick. I was just in awe. He might have said other things, but at that point you don&rsquo;t hear much (laughs). You&rsquo;ll never know you&rsquo;ll react until he&rsquo;s right behind. I thought I was cool around every star, but there&rsquo;s the ones that still shake you up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rob Hoffman, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4325168&amp;postcount=14"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Gearslutz&rdquo; forum (June 27, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190822160956/https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4325168&amp;postcount=14"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was fortunate enough to work with MJ early in my career. He was an incredible artist. Talented beyond your wildest dreams. Extremely generous, and a hard worker. I actually went from a staff assistant at the Hit Factory in NYC to freelance engineer under Swedien and MJ. They were due to start in Los Angeles when the Northridge earthquake hit so they moved to New York. One room was all Bruce, the second room was the writing room. I started assisting Bruce&#39;s writing partner Rene Moore. I would track stuff with Rene, and Bruce would come in and tell me what I did wrong, sit in for a few hours and set us straight. After a couple months MJ arrived and the entire tour rig was moved in along with Brad Buxer, Andrew Scheps, and Eddie Delena. I continued to assist them until the whole crew moved to L.A., they decided to take me with them. I would assist Bruce during the day, and help out everywhere else at night - assisting, engineering, programming, and on one song playing guitar. We had two rooms at Record One, and two rooms at Larrabee where I met John. At one point in NYC we had just about every room at the Hit Factory. The crew was great, and I learned so much from all of them. I learned to engineer from Bruce Swedien, John, and Eddie, and got to sit in with producers like MJ, Jam And Lewis, Babyface, David Foster, Teddy Riley, and Dallas Austin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was actually asked to leave the project early on because there were too many people around and MJ didn&#39;t know me. Luckily, I was rehired about 10 days later. At the wrap party MJ apologized profusely, and expressed his gratitude. Truly the most sincere man you will ever meet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some random memories:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One morning MJ came in with a new song he had written overnight. We called in a guitar player, and Michael sang every note of every chord to him. &quot;here&#39;s the first chord first note, second note, third note. Here&#39;s the second chord first note, second note, third note&quot;, etc., etc. We then witnessed him giving the most heartfelt and profound vocal performance, live in the control room through an SM57.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He would sing us an entire string arrangement, every part. Steve Porcaro once told me he witnessed MJ doing that with the string section in the room. Had it all in his head, harmony and everything. Not just little eight bar loop ideas. he would actually sing the entire arrangement into a micro-cassette recorder complete with stops and fills.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At one point Michael was angry at one of the producers on the project because he was treating everyone terribly. Rather than create a scene or fire the guy, Michael called him to his office/lounge and one of the security guys threw a pie in his face. No further action was needed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...His beatboxing was without parallel, and his time was ridiculous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His sense of harmony was incredible. Never a bad note, no tuning, even his breathing was perfectly in time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once, while we were taking a break, I think we were actually watching the OJ chase on TV, there was a news program talking about him being in Europe with some little boy. I was sitting next to the guy while the news is making this crap up. He just looked at me and said this is what I have to deal with.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I spent close to 3 years working with him, and not once did I question his morals, or ever believe any of the allegations. I wasn&#39;t even a fan then. I saw him interact with his brothers kids, other people&#39;s children, and at one point my own girlfriend&#39;s kids. I got to spend a day at Neverland with them. A completely incredible human being, always looking for a way to make all children&#39;s lives better. Every weekend at Neverland was donated to a different children&#39;s group - children with AIDS, children cancer, etc., and most of the time he wasn&#39;t there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I was there when Lisa Marie was around. They acted like two kids in love. Held hands all the time, and she hung out at the studio for quite a while. I never questioned their love for each other.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The last weekend of recording on HIStory he came to me and Eddie Delena, and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t think any of us are going to sleep this weekend. There&#39;s a lot to get done, and we have to go to Bernie on Monday morning&quot;. He stayed at the studio the entire time, singing, and mixing. I got to spend a couple quiet moments with him during that time. We talked about John Lennon one night as he was gearing up to sing the last vocal of the record - the huge ad libs at the end of &quot;earth song&quot;. I told him the story of John singing &quot;twist and shout&quot; while being sick, and though most people think he was screaming for effect, it was actually his voice giving out. He loved it, and then went in to sing his heart out. . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later that night, while mixing, everyone left the room so MJ could turn it up. This was a common occurrence during the mixes, and I was left in the room with ear plugs, and hands over my ears, in case he needed something. This particular night, all the lights were out and we noticed some blue flashes intermittently lighting up the room during playback. After a few moments we could see that one of the speakers (custom quad augspurgers) was shooting blue flames. Mj liked this and proceeded to push all the faders up . . . . </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ liked hot water while he was singing. I mean really hot !!!!! It got to the point that I would melt plastic spoons to test it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce and I were talking about walking to the studio everyday in NYC, and what routes we took. Michael looked at us and said we were so lucky to be able to do that. He couldn&#39;t walk down the street without being harassed. It was a sad moment for all of us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...He got one of the first Playstations from sony in his lounge . . . we snuck in late at night to play the games that hadn&#39;t been released yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A couple people on the session hadn&#39;t seen Jurassic Park while it was out, so MJ arranged a private screening for us at Sony.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was a huge fan of Nine Inch Nails Downward Spiral . . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was lucky enough over the course of 3 years to have access to the multitrack masters for tour prep, videos, and archive purposes. To be able to pull these tracks apart was a huge lesson in production, and songwriting. A chance to look into the minds of geniuses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of all the records I&#39;ve worked on, MJJ was the only company to give platinum award records.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One day we just all sat in the studio listening to his catalog with him for inspiration. He loved the process, he loved the work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4443366&amp;postcount=597"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Gearslutz&rdquo; forum (August 4, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190924175235/https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4443366&amp;postcount=597"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For what it&#39;s worth, MJ and Prince did have a meeting during HIStory as well.
