And it was just a strange, eerie, lonely time for me. Outside my hotel was just a sea of faces of... of fans chanting and screaming. But I was inside my room and I felt so all alone, like I was the last person of the planet. And in the song I say &quot;How does it feel when you&#39;re alone and you&#39;re cold inside.&quot; I say &quot;It&#39;s like a stranger in Moscow&quot; and that&#39;s pretty much how I felt. And the people were some of the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met. And the concert was very successful, but that day, especially that day, I just felt this different feeling and the song &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot; came to me. So, that&#39;s how it was written.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brad Buxer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Brad_Buxer_Interview_(Black_%26_White,_November/December_2009)"><span class="cs8567212B">Black &amp; White Magazine interview (translation by SegaLoco)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black &amp; White: In the studio, Michael gave you a lot of freedom?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brad Buxer: Absolutely. Michael was not one of rigid, he was always open to my suggestions and ideas. He gave me full confidence... Sometimes, he knew exactly what he wanted to hear me sing all the parts of a song. Other times, he let me play until he hears something he likes. This is particularly what happened to songs like &quot;Who Is It&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stranger In Moscow&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black &amp; White: One of the surprising things in the music of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sonic 3</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> is that you can hear the chords of Stranger In Moscow, which is supposed to have been composed later ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buxer: Yes, Michael and I had made the following arrangements for the game, and it has served as the basis for Stranger In Moscow. More than any other song that I worked with Michael, Stranger In Moscow is where I made my most artistic leg. I&#39;m not credited as co-composer on this track, but I have worked closely with Michael on the composition and structure of this song ... I also played virtually all instruments &hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black &amp; White: Did that not bother you that Michael did not include it in the song credits as co-composer?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buxer: No. I did not ask to be. When you have the opportunity to work with such a musical genius, be credited or not, it does not really matter. I had a great opportunity to working with Michael all these years. I&#39;m probably the musician with whom he worked most of his career. I was a musician and arranger from 1989 until 2006. It shows how we were on stage, him and me&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buxer: ...Unlike &ldquo;Stranger In Moscow&rdquo;, Michael knew exactly what he wanted to hear each instrument pure [in &ldquo;Morphine&rdquo;].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank Cascio, &ldquo;My Friend, Michael&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the [Dangerous] tour I witnessed Michael working with Brad Buxer, the musician, on the song &ldquo;Stranger in Moscow.&rdquo; Moscow had been a stop earlier on the tour, before Eddie and I had arrived. During his stay in the Russian city, Michael had been feeling deeply sad and alone because of the allegations he was facing. He had been sitting on the closet floor in his hotel room, crying, when the song came to him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brad was Michael&rsquo;s music director and personal music producer at the time, and there was a unique closeness to their collaboration. Michael told Brad the idea for the song, giving him a melody. Brad, who had set up a recording studio in his hotel room, created the song around that melody. They worked on the song constantly, Michael singing elements and giving beats to Brad, and Brad transforming them into music. Watching them cowrite, I saw how a song begins with an idea, with simple chords, and builds as time goes on. Michael said that he liked to let a song write itself. It told him what it needed. He&rsquo;d spontaneously start singing and dancing around the hotel while the song evolved in his heart and mind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mike Smallcombe, Making Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While on tour, Michael was writing music with Brad Buxer, who had taken over from Greg Phillinganes as the tour&rsquo;s musical director for the third leg. The pair often worked on material in their hotel rooms. &ldquo;I always had musical gear in my hotel room so I could work on ideas both for and with Michael,&rdquo; Buxer said. &ldquo;The gear was called a &lsquo;Hotel Room System&rsquo;, studio gear that the crew would set up in my hotel room so I could work on stuff with Michael.&rdquo; One of the songs the pair worked on while in the Russian capital became a song called &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The idea for the song came about when Michael called Buxer to his room in the Presidential Suite at the city&rsquo;s Hotel Metropol at 10.30am one morning. &ldquo;I had a cassette player with me of the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 cues that I had been working on for him and Sega, I thought he called to see me so he could hear how the cues were coming on for the Sega game,&rdquo; Buxer said. &ldquo;Instead, he said, &lsquo;I want you to sit at the piano and just play&rsquo;. There was an upright piano in the room and I just started playing stuff, and one of the things I played was one of the cues I had done for the Sega game. He loved it and this became the verse for &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buxer then moved on to other chords, which became the chorus, and in an hour and a half, &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo; was born. &ldquo;When I left the room it was noon time and I remember standing underneath the doorway saying goodbye to him &ndash; it was so obvious that we had just written a beautiful song together that I said nothing,&rdquo; Buxer said. &ldquo;I almost said, &lsquo;Did we just write a song together&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The lyrics came to Michael on the day of his show at Moscow&rsquo;s Luzhniki Stadium. The night before, he received the news that his accuser&rsquo;s father had officially filed a $ 30 million civil lawsuit against him. Michael said the idea fell into his lap because of the emotions he was feeling. &ldquo;The lyrics are totally autobiographical,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you hear lines like, &lsquo;Here abandoned in my fame&hellip; Armageddon of the brain&rsquo; &ndash; at the time that&rsquo;s how I really felt. It kinda created itself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael wouldn&rsquo;t join the team until March [1994]. &ldquo;Maybe he was waiting for the weather to warm up so he could avoid the cold weather,&rdquo; Forger said. In the meantime, Michael was communicating with Brad Buxer from the west over the phone. Buxer flew to New York a few weeks before Michael, so he could start working on &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo; with engineer Eddie Delena. &ldquo;Eddie was the engineer who I brought to the project and who was in the studio working with me, and all I was working on this entire time was &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo;,&rdquo; Buxer said. Before arriving in New York, Buxer recorded Michael beatboxing in the dance studio at Neverland. Buxer then made drum sounds out of the beatbox samples, which were used for the song&rsquo;s intro, and completed the piano, string and drum elements before Michael arrived on the East Coast.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo; was the first song Michael and Buxer worked on. &ldquo;When Michael finally came out to New York and heard my work on &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo;, the strings, piano, drums and the beatboxing samples that make up the rhythmic backbone of the track, he literally shrieked with joy,&rdquo; Buxer recalls. Although Buxer is the co-writer of &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo;, as he created the music, Michael would not credit him. &ldquo;That song, more than anything I&rsquo;ve ever done with him, was a true collaboration to say the least,&rdquo; Buxer revealed. &ldquo;It is absolutely my most important contribution to him.&rdquo; But Buxer doesn&rsquo;t hold a grudge. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t receive a songwriting credit on it,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But Michael chose not to credit me; there is nothing I can do about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Steve Porcaro, Mike Smallcombe&rsquo;s Making Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My involvement on HIStory started when myself, David Paich and Steve Lukather were flown to New York to work on &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo;,&rdquo; Porcaro said. &ldquo;We were supposed to be there for one day. David and Steve did their bits [Lukather on background guitar and Paich on keyboards/ synth/ bass] and then flew out to Europe for the Toto tour. I wasn&rsquo;t going on that tour so I was asked to stay, and I ended up staying for a month!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ryan Arnold, assistant audio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">Reddit AMA (April 25, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Much of the song&#39;s instrumental structure was constructed in the studio, including the melody. I would imagine he had some idea in his head, but it wasn&#39;t realized until recording. I remember he was asking a few session musicians for help with some reading musical notation, and they played a few notes for him at some point, and taking that in, I would guess Michael really only had a basic melody and beat in his head before he came in, then the rest was similar to what I said about Scream earlier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Stranger in Moscow made me sad, because throughout the entire time we were all working, there was a very pained look on his face each time after recording&hellip; [The song] seemed very personal, I remember at one point after recording the chorus, he walked out instead of working on the lower harmonies. The song had a different name initially, or maybe it was a working title. The demo I remember had a basic melody and hook, with some mumbled lyrics. I would have to dig up old paperwork in the office. Maybe this weekend I will! I&#39;m thinking of making a Youtube to talk about all of this stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I recall something interesting about Stranger in Moscow. One of the staff at the studio was going over the tracksheet and lyrics Jackson had handwritten. He gave a look of, &quot;Hey, not bad,&quot; or something to that effect, and then asked, &quot;So, were you in Moscow and followed by the KGB?&quot; Michael said that the song was putting his past to the present because it fit so well. In other words, the song wasn&#39;t about current (at the time) experiences in Moscow, as the KGB had been dissolved along with many other state commissions along with the Soviet Union a couple years prior to his first visit in 1993. He mentioned that people would shadow him after Thriller, and felt like he was being watched/stalked by people like Boris and Natasha from that old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon. I think that was also the basis for &ldquo;This Time Around&rdquo;, though we didn&#39;t work on that one. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say it was because of that in conjunction with a comment he made off hand around the same time about having a lack of freedom and being isolated/treated like a criminal for over a decade, which I thought was a tad weird due to the allegations only being from 1993.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rob Hoffman, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4325168&amp;postcount=14"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Gearslutz&rdquo; forum (June 27, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190822160956/https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4325168&amp;postcount=14"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was the tape op for the recording of the background vocals on &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;.
