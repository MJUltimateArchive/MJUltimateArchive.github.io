He was a good friend at the time and it thanks to him that I got back into the music industry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/iNnqooz1D7E"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Konbini&rdquo; (August 27, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We were very good friends. When I made this song for &ldquo;HIStory&rdquo;, I did not want to do it because I was in rehab at the time. I was being treated for addiction, and it lasted eight months.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did not want to be in a recording studio anymore. I thought my musical career was over. Michael contacted me to say, &quot;Nile, I want you to make a song.&quot; I told him, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Michael, I stopped.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Why did you stop? So I explained to her that I was being treated for addiction and that I was part of a program. Not only you can not say no to Michael Jackson, but he did something wonderful for me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[He tells story of Michael making a girl with brain cancer&rsquo;s wish of meeting him come true by bringing her and Nile onstage and backstage during a &ldquo;Bad Tour&rdquo; concert. Celebrities in the audience go over to meet her when they arrive back in their seats and give her gifts. Nile reads letter from her a couple days later, and she expresses utter joy from Michael&rsquo;s actions. (Full story in September 12, 1987 entry gold document)]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After that, my love for Michael went crazy. Remember, we knew each other when we were teenagers, we were already friends. But after he did that, I loved him and I could not refuse him anything. But if I continued to say no, he kept calling me back. I said no, he kept calling me back. Finally, I said, &quot;Okay!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I told him, &quot;I am taking part in a program for drug addicts and I am afraid to go back to a recording studio. Because if I go back, they will believe that I want what I normally get. Which means, &quot;Bring champagne, cocaine, call the girls ...&quot; No, that&#39;s not what I want, I just want to play a song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I told him, &quot;I&#39;m going to wait downstairs and then go upstairs to play it and when it&#39;s good, you tell me, and I go back home. When I played it, I realized I missed it. He wanted to chat with an old friend. When I finished playing, it took me ten minutes to do my part because he knew exactly what he wanted, I played it and it was over.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said to me, &quot;Can we talk? And we talked for almost three hours, and this is the last time I saw him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/nile-rodgers-on-working-with-michael-jackson-were-weird-guys-118650/"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (October 3, 2013)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My part on the Michael Jackson record really took minutes. Minutes. He okayed it, and he was like, &ldquo;Great.&rdquo; As I was leaving the studio, he stopped me and said, &ldquo;Nile, can I talk to you for a while?&rdquo; We talked for about an hour. I told him about what I was doing to get sober and the day program, and he had never heard this phrase &ldquo;day program.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d never heard it either until I&rsquo;d gotten to rehab. And I explained to him how a day program worked. I was shocked he was so interested in drug rehab and all this stuff. I didn&rsquo;t know Michael as anything but this sort of pixie-like character.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I looked at the world through his eyes. He was overly concerned about the way the media was representing him, or misrepresenting him. The world seemed like it was against him. And I offered him a remedy, which was, &ldquo;Come to my house [in Connecticut], and nobody will even care.&rdquo; And I could see the look on his face, like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want people to not care, I only want them to say good stuff.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Well, Michael, they can&rsquo;t always say good stuff! Because we&rsquo;re weird. We&rsquo;re weird guys, and we do weird stuff. And it&rsquo;s open for criticism, bro!&rdquo; He&rsquo;d been famous since he was a child. So he only knew superstardom, and he only knew when people loved him. When people were weird with him, he couldn&rsquo;t understand it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ryan Arnold, assistant audio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">Reddit AMA (April 25, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/MichaelJackson/comments/bhi3u6/i_was_an_assistant_audio_engineer_on_history_ama/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ryan Arnold: &ldquo;Money&rdquo; is a song that was written in chunks. The chorus to my knowledge came first, and Jackson was slowly working on an instrumental for it. I think I would liken his approach to instruments to a child... but it worked, really well at that. He would take an instrument, say the Korg M1 used on Scream. He would fiddle with the knobs (changing the presets) and feel for a sound. Once he found a basic idea, he would refine it by fiddling further and further. Mind you Mr. Jackson would spend hours and hours doing this for some synths, but other times just five minutes. I think he found the sound he was looking for on the M1 relatively quick, within a half hour. From there he would make sounds with his voice and clap while attempting to play. Jimmy would be recording this, so it&#39;s all on tape in his archives, and at a particular point Michael would just get it. He would spend all that time messing around on the keyboard, like a kid in a music shop, and then out of nowhere he&#39;d say, &quot;There, right there! Did you get that?&quot; It would be a chord progression he was trying to figure out. It would be difficult for him to repeatedly do it, so he would hand it over to Jimmy for refinement, such as taking it up a key. That&#39;s how you have that opening progression in Scream.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: How prepared was Michael during the sessions? Did he write a lot of things down? Or was he more spontaneous?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Sometimes he was prepared, other times he wasn&#39;t. Take Money for example. I think the original song was Murder (I&#39;ll check my old notes this weekend), and the focus of the chorus was about murdering for money. Once he started jamming out with that other singer, he misspoke the chorus lyrics and the entire aim of the song changed in that way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;&rdquo;Money&rdquo; was an interesting song because it wasn&#39;t just Jackson in the booth. I believe he had another singer with him, relatively unknown. The background vocals weren&#39;t separated, which is fairly unusual. If you look at other songs like Scream, Michael and Janet&#39;s vocals are layered. Such was not the case with Money. I was never informed why that was the case, but if I had to guess, I would reason because it was impromptu. In fact, I remember a bit of dialogue fairly clearly. Michael had the session musicians playing random chords, like a jam session just to see where it would take them. He would mumble lyrics to these progressions. I recall the other man being rather stiff and visibly upset at some points. I think that may have been what prompted Michael to start singing the chorus to lyrics he had on paper, to Money. Part of the song&#39;s rhythmic structure is actually from that jam session, though the chorus was clearly written and planned out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reddit User: Did Michael ever explain the &lsquo;Trump&rsquo; name-drop in his song, &ldquo;Money&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Arnold: Michael and Donald Trump had a documented friendship in the media back then, but I think as time went on Jackson was bothered by Trump&#39;s greed. Because unlike Jackson, a lot of what the media reported about Trump back then was true, because it wasn&#39;t out to get him being a successful white businessman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Early version titled, &lsquo;Anything For Money.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A version was recorded with Michael swearing and mentioning the word &lsquo;murder&rsquo;. This is a much longer version.</span></p></body>
