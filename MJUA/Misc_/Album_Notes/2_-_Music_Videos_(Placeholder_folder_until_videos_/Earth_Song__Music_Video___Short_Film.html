Since I found the piece really extraordinary, I contacted Michael, and suggested a conversion idea for the clip. I was still lucky, my idea pleased him very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: How did the film go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: For about six weeks, my team and I roamed the world in search of environments where we could shoot. After we were on shooting spots, we turned for 2 days in every country. We went to Amazonia, Tanzania, Croatia and we shot the sequences with Michael at the end in New Jersey.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: What do you think about the end result?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: Once you have a magical song, you already have an excellent scenario: Half of the work has already been done. In the case of the Earth Song, I decided to let myself be guided by the narrative structure of the song. It takes 6:40 and it contains a linear dramatic course. It has a well defined beginning, a middle and an end. This is what I like about the video, namely, that we have retained this structure, and emphasized the emotional impact of the music with strong images. Again, there are small things I&#39;m not satisfied with, like some special effects that are outdated. Likewise, I do not like the lighting of the burnt field where Michael has shot his sequence ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: This means?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: The backdrop is too bright. This is a problem I&#39;ve always had with Michael. He demanded always being over-exposed. He wanted to be heavily lit to remove some of the details of his face. That was one of the rare, frustrating things that he forced me on. He insisted that these powerful headlights were pointed at him. This did not fit into the light of the backdrop, the concept of the video or the mood of the song. But he held fast to it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: Did Michael see the end result?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: He was very happy when he saw the finished video. Really very happy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: What did these videos cost?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: The most expensive was Earth Song with a budget of $ 2.6 million. Stranger in Moscow cost 1.8 million Cry, I do not remember exactly, but I believe it amounted to about 1 million just as with Childhood.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: When you think back to Michael, what do you remember?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: I will never forget a special moment. That was when shooting to Earth Song. We were shooting at night in New Jersey, in the middle of a ruined field, where everything had burned down. This was the last sequence of the song. I remember the mood at the filming location. Everywhere, all these technicians were very disgusted and cynical people from New York, who were preoccupied by Michael. One could even feel a certain hostility towards him. But as soon as the music ran and Michael began to dance, all heads turned to him, all froze, and I saw their jaw dropping down. All these people were captivated by the spectacle of this extraordinary artist. They were full of admiration. All the rest had disappeared. This is the memory of Michael I have kept.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Unknown interview</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The most interesting time for me was on &ldquo;Earth Song&rdquo; when, I had a bunch of very cynical, jaded New Yorkers for crew, the part of the shoot that he was there, and they were just auh, Michael Jackson, dadadadada. But then, when he started singing, at the end of that song, and he&rsquo;s just, screaming out the vocals, you could, you could just see, you just look around and everybody had stopped in their tracks and was watching him, riveted. And he&rsquo;d only give you like one take from each angle because he was being blasted by, you know, these wind machines and, stuff was flying in his eyes and, just, I mean it was really hard. I mean it was just firing dust and leaves and, all matter of stuff, into his face, and everybody was just electrified. And he completely turned everybody around.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
