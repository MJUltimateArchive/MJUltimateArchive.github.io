We knew that it was going to be a cornerstone of the album and it set the mood and the feel for the rest of the music. If we would work on a piece of music, or somebody would bring something to us; if it didn&#39;t live up to that standard, then forget it. In fact, we recorded a ton of stuff that we didn&#39;t use. A lot of times a real good piece of music will never get on the album, only because it just doesn&#39;t fit. You know Michael loves drama. If the music doesn&#39;t have drama, if it&#39;s just a derivative of a piece of music without drama, Michael&#39;s not going to go for it. There is a lot of drama on this album, though.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mike Smallcombe, &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The very first demo that was played to Michael was called &lsquo;You Rock My World&rsquo;. After hearing the track, Michael asked who was doing the melodies. &ldquo;It was me,&rdquo; recalls LaShawn Daniels, &ldquo;and he [Michael] says, &lsquo;Shawn can you sing the melodies in my ear?&rsquo; And I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Are you serious dude?&rsquo; He&lsquo;s like, &lsquo;Yeah just sing it in my ear.&rsquo; I go right next to him and I gotta pull towards his ear and I start singing. Then he puts his hand on my shoulder and says, &lsquo;No. Let&rsquo;s change this part.&rsquo; And I was like, &lsquo;Oh, my god!&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t even continue and I had to stop. I said, &lsquo;Mike, listen, I appreciate you being so cool, but you can&rsquo;t be this cool with me because I don&rsquo;t really know how to take it. I don&rsquo;t even know what to do right now. And I can&rsquo;t concentrate on the melodies because I&rsquo;m singing to Michael Jackson.&rsquo; And he burst out laughing and just made us comfortable.&rdquo;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Songs [Bruce Swedien and Stuart Brawley] started mixing in the first couple of weeks at Marvin&rsquo;s Room include &lsquo;Break of Dawn&rsquo; and two Rodney Jerkins tracks, &lsquo;You Rock My World&rsquo; and &lsquo;Privacy&rsquo;, the latter of which is another attack on the media. Swedien said the team knew &lsquo;You Rock My World&rsquo; was going to be an album cornerstone. &ldquo;It set the mood and the feel for the rest of the music,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
