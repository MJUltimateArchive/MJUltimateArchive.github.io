I think that&#39;s one of the most sensual songs he has ever made and that&#39;s what I wanted to hear from Michael. I do not know if you knew, this is the first time he talks about making love in a song. I do not know if you had addressed this very issue with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Freeze: (laughs) Yeah, thank you. It was his favorite song. That was his baby!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Do you remember the exact number of songs that you have presented?<br/>F: I introduced him to many songs. The main songs on which we worked are &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot;, &quot;A Place With No Name&quot; and &quot;Blue Gangsta&quot;. These three songs were our priorities. &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot; is one of the songs that have been finalized. Others have been released later. They are kept in reserve.<br/>&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: You have therefore proposed his &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot;, and then you had to redo the song in full by following his advice?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No, he just had to record vocals...and add his magic! It was like flowers and trees grew in the song! He touched her and it became magical! I was shocked!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: So all the musical parts and the lyrics were made in advance?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, he loved the song! He wanted to leave it as is! All of it was me on this piece, no one had the right to change anything. Because it sounded like he had heard it for the first time we had a dream, a vision, and he wanted to recreate this dream in song to the last detail. He did not want to change anything, he wanted to keep the magic of the song absolutely intact. What you hear on Invincible is exactly the version I&#39;ve given him before he raises his voice there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: How long did it take him to record the song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: It took him time because he wanted a lot of momentum in the voice, especially the harmony you hear in the chorus. It took time. The process was in the studio as long as if we were filming a movie!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: So he was taken to record his voice, listen to it, arrange it, working on other songs, then he returned a few days later to make additional catches...right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, it was incremental work. Sometimes he recorded the lead vocals, sometimes it was just the chorus or ad-lib...He also listened to the different mixes and changed some details around here or there. He was in full creative control. We wanted the song to be perfect, and to return to my analogy about film, it was a bit like a director looking to improve his film by changing the script or changing players. This is the type of process that was used to create this song, and overall, the album Invincible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: So basically, he changed a verse, started work on another song, and a few days later, he came to you to change the song again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes. When he returned, changes were made and ideas were proposed, he listened attentively. It also arose at times to arrange two or three things. Ultimately, all decisions were his. He was the boss. He was open to any criticism or suggestions beneficial to the song, as the tune kept its effectiveness. All that interested him was to have #1 hits.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quagmire: As I said earlier, &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot; contains very specific words. It&#39;s very sensual and it&#39;s the first time he talks about making love. How did he feel over this when you made the recordings, in what state of mind was he in? Were there any special wishes during these sessions?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Freeze: No, he just told me he loved the song. I do not give him orders, he knew exactly what to do. He took control of the plane, I&#39;m just busy taking off.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Basically, he said: &quot;Can we do what verse again, Ell...&quot; By the way, is what you called Elliot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No, he always called me &quot;Freeze&quot;!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: And you, you immediately called him by his first name?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Absolutely! We were really close. In fact, to be precise, I called him by his nickname &quot;Mike&quot; instead of Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Getting back to &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;, can you tell us why Michael Jackson does not sing the chorus of this song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Well, because he liked my version of the chorus. He found it very beautiful, and he wanted to leave everything as is. He liked my singing. He would not spoil the chorus, he loved how I had preserved it. My trademark is to make the chorus to every song that I produce(&quot;Poison,&quot; &quot;I Want to Sex You Up&quot;). I&#39;ve been doing this forever, and Michael loved my singing on &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Where did you get the inspiration for the [song] &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot;...? How does your creative process work?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot; is just a romantic ballad that I wrote one day&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Do you remember the microphone used for &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No. We were in so many studios...It&#39;s a question you should ask for sound engineers: they each had their own equipment and I do not remember exactly what they had.</span></p></body>
