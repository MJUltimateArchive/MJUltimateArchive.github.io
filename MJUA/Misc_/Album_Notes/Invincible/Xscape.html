I go--and I hadn&#39;t even heard it, I go, &quot;Can I hear it?&quot; and he played it, and I go--because I was a big fan of the band from the UK in the 80&#39;s called &quot;Scritti Politti&quot;... but that song reminded me of that great percussion and the kind of vocals, and the interesting thing was--well, I guess Michael didn&#39;t think it was the top 15 but, years later, when I was working with Michael, just he and I in 2008--and it was because of the song Xscape--I always wanted to ask him if he was a fan of &quot;Scritti Polliti&quot;, and he lit up when I said that, he said he loved them. He was a huge fan of &quot;Scritti Politti&quot;, that I was thinking--I didn&#39;t say this to him, I&#39;m going, &quot;Well then why didn&#39;t he put Xscape on there?&quot; [laughs] Because it just had that kind of great vibe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
