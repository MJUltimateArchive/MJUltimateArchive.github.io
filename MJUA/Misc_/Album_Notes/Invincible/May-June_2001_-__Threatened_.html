And Michael actually dedicated a song to me! It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Threatened,&rdquo; and I think he was trying to make it another &ldquo;Thriller,&rdquo; because they cut in a Rod Serling rap. He dedicated the song to me, and then said, &ldquo;I want to do a video of this song, and I want you to direct it.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;Uhhhh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></body>
