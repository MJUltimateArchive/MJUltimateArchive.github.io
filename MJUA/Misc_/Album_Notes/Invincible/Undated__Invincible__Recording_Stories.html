How did you guys meet and, you know, how did your collaboration go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He was this guy who went around Hollywood and around the industry saying his dream was to work with me to everybody. Then at Carol Bayer Sager&#39;s house, who&#39;s this great song writer; won several academy awards for her songwriting, said, &quot;There&#39;s a guy I used to work with. His name is Rodney Jerkins, he&#39;s been crying to me begging to meet you. I mean, why don&#39;t you pick up the phone and say &#39;hi&#39; to him.&quot; And he came over that day and he said, &quot;Please, my dream is to work with you. Will you give me two weeks and I&#39;ll see what I can come up with.&quot; And uh, we ended up working together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeCurtis:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And what were your impressions of him, like as just somebody... What did he bring; what did you feel that his contribution was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> His contribution was he loves to create in the same kind of way that I like to create. But I pushed Rodney. And pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed him to create... uh, to innovate more. To pioneer more. He&#39;s a real musician. He&#39;s a real musician and he&#39;s very dedicated and he&#39;s real loyal. He has perseverance. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen perseverance like his in anyone. Because you can push him and push him and he doesn&#39;t get angry. Yeah, I think he&#39;s a great guy, he really is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rodney Jerkins, album co-producer, &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; magazine (1999) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423133955/www.michael-jackson-trader.com/news/1999/November/index.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My association with Michael came about after I was introduced to Carole Bayer Sager by Atlantic VP Craig Kaman. She asked me if I would like to come to her house and write with her and Michael. So I said, Cool. I flew to Los Angeles, and sure enough Michael was there at her house. We just caught a good vibe, and I&#39;ve been working on his album for about six, seven months now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Working with Michael... Oh my God, it&#39;s incredible! Every time I see him, I tell him over and over, It&#39;s incredible just to be here working with you, knowing how crazy I was about you when I was a kid.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103125/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/2001sept.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Entertainment Weekly&rdquo; magazine (September 21, 2001)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jerkins, who produced seven songs with Jackson over a three-year period, says working with the star was &quot;different. Usually, seven songs would take me about 20 days to finish. But Michael is a perfectionist. Oh, my goodness, I couldn&#39;t tell you how many sessions we did--so, so many. We worked in L.A., we worked in New York, we worked in Miami, we worked in my studio in New Jersey, we worked all over. He&#39;s the kind of artist who doesn&#39;t allow one mistake on his records. He doesn&#39;t believe in putting out anything regular--it has to be above the norm. And this album is just superb, man. It&#39;s just incredible.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo; magazine (July 11, 2002) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://clubs.dir.bg/showflat.php?Board=mjackson&amp;Number=1937976364&amp;page=&amp;view=&amp;sb=&amp;vc=1"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191009203036/http://clubs.dir.bg/showflat.php?Board=mjackson&amp;Number=1937976364&amp;page=&amp;view=&amp;sb=&amp;vc=1"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You&#39;ve recently worked with Michael Jackson. Were you disappointed things didn&#39;t work out?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Rodney Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Are you kidding? Working with Michael was like... nothing else, y&#39;know what I mean? I&#39;ve done Whitney Houston, Britney - all the giants but nothing came close to me and Michael. He&#39;s the top. Nothing will ever beat that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">So are you saying, as a producer, you&#39;ve reached your peak?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, the work I did on Invincible is the best stuff I&#39;ve ever done. There&#39;s a lot stuff, which, you know, people haven&#39;t heard as well. There&#39;s unfinished stuff, you know, stuff that needs going back to. I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll be collaborating with Michael again... we just worked good together. I really want people to hear some of the stuff we did together which never made the cut. The reaction from the blacks was like &#39;yeah, he&#39;s back for real.&#39; And that was only based on three or four cuts I did. There&#39;s a whole lot of stuff, just as good, maybe better. People have gotta hear it, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">So why wasn&#39;t this material ever used on the final cut?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, Michael&#39;s like no other, you know what I&#39;m saying? He records hundreds... really, hundreds of songs for an album. So what we did, we cut it down to 35 of the best tracks and picked from there. (It&#39;s) not always about picking the hottest tracks, it&#39;s gotta have flow, so there&#39;s a good albums worth of material that could blow your mind, you know. I really hope this stuff comes out because it&#39;s some of his best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Where do you rank Invincible amongst his other albums?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s one of my favourites, for sure, not just because I&#39;m on it. Off The Wall was always my favourite and I loved Thriller and Dangerous, but Invincible was about bringing Michael back. Stuff like Unbreakable, You Rock My World and Butterflies... black stations died for it, you know. It was like the guy who sang The Lady In My Life had come back.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Teddy Riley has recently filed for bankruptcy after working on Michael&#39;s last album. How are you financially?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">(Laughs). I&#39;m doing good you know. But there was some stuff going around for a while. It&#39;s not for me to say, but... well, there were debts. And I&#39;m not talking about from Michael, he&#39;s real good about it all. But business things, you know, they turned nasty.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Are you talking about the situation between Michael and Tommy Mottola?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, I mean, like I said, you know it&#39;s not for me to say. But I support Michael&#39;s cause. I know where he&#39;s coming from.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">What&#39;s Michael like, people often consider him an oddball?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You know, he&#39;s nothing like what people think. He&#39;s real funny. People still think he&#39;s got this high, timid little voice. He&#39;s not like that. Just a great guy. Always creating and he&#39;s happy you know. His kids make him very happy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Cut&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You were once considered a guaranteed hitmaker, but it&#39;s been more hit and miss lately, with projects with The Spice Girls and Michael Jackson not spawning any hit singles. Why do you think that is?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Invincible sold 9 million. That&#39;s a hit to me. (Do) you know how much I got from that? If you did, you&#39;d be calling it a hit. Black radio, they eat it up. It was a hit to the market I was aiming for. I wanted to be the man that bought him back to the blacks. I was successful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sometimes it doesn&#39;t always go down as well as you&#39;d like. Nothing&rsquo;s ever a guarantee, never written in stone, you know what I mean? Stuff like the work I did with The Spice Girls, it was good stuff, just didn&#39;t work out. (It) wasn&#39;t what people wanted from them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vibe.com/2009/09/v-exclusive-rodney-jerkins-talks-mjs-last-studio-album-invincible"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (September 5, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180916060119/https://www.vibe.com/2009/09/v-exclusive-rodney-jerkins-talks-mjs-last-studio-album-invincible/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You were around 19 when you started working on </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. You guys became friends in the process. What was the friendship like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Rodney Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Sometimes he would come to my house for dinner, or I&#39;d go out with him and his kids. It&#39;s really trust. You build trust around each other. He use to tell me all the time, &quot;You&#39;re a true loyal friend.&quot; And he knew that when certain situations arose, I had his back.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;ll never forget, Michael just let me take all my friends and literally gave me Neverland Ranch. He&#39;d be like, &quot;I have to go to Germany for a month,&quot; and just leave. I&#39;d call everybody I knew, like, &quot;Yo, party at Neverland!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Plus we would have bets, like whoever wins gets like a 100 DVDs. He beat me the first time and I took him to Virgin Mega Store in Times Square and got him like a 100 DVDs. We went late at night. The first time he went to the store, he was in disguise. But a fan noticed him and blew the whole cover.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: Why did the album take so long to finish? You guys were going at it for three years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">It was a lot of starting and stopping. Like, we would stop for three months and then Michael would be like, &quot;I got to go to Germany for a couple months,&quot; then he&#39;d go to LA, it was that kind of situation. And I remember one time, he was like, &quot;Let&#39;s start from scratch...I think we can beat everything we did.&quot; That was his perfectionist side. I was like &quot;Man, we been working for a year, we gone scrap everything?!&quot; But it showed how hard he goes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: You were cool with that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I was. You got to understand, when I worked with Michael I had already worked with everybody. I was making a lot of money to be able to work on just one thing. And there was a time where he took a break, and Brandy&#39;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Full Moon</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> project came up, and I told Michael, &quot;I got to do this album.&quot; I was working on both at exactly the same time, at the Hit Factory in Miami. And I was literally running back and forth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: I heard you videotaped the </span><span class="cs52DB4310">Invincible</span><span class="cs31D24DEE"> studio sessions. Have you released that yet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Shh![</span><span class="cs43C038A">laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">]. I&#39;ll just say Michael asked me to document everything. And I did. And I&#39;m sure one day it&#39;ll see the light of day. I got to make sure it&#39;s made in the way Michael would want to see it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: Do you ever go back and watch the footage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">All the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: What was Jackson like in the studio? Timid?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">No! He was super vocal. He was so hands on. I&#39;m talking about from the high hat to everything. The sound quality was so important to him. He looked at everything under a microscope, like, &quot;The middle frequency is too much&quot;--he was very technical. He use to always say, &quot;Melody is king&quot; so he really focused in on melody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: Let&#39;s be honest: are you proud of the outcome of </span><span class="cs52DB4310">Invincible?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">There&#39;s stuff we didn&#39;t put on the album that I wish was on the album. My first batch [of beats] is what I really wanted him to do. I was trying to really go vintage, old school Mike. And that&#39;s what a lot of my first stuff was, that I was presenting to him. He kept &quot;Rock My World.&quot; But he wanted to go more futuristic. So I would find myself at like junkyards, and we&#39;d be out hitting stuff, to create our sound.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> needs to be re-released. Because something happened at the record company [Sony] that caused them not to promote it no more after we done put our heart and soul in it. He had about five singles on the album. But it came down to who can stop who. And he was caught up in that mess.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: A lot of critics criticized the album for being so long. Was it Jackson&#39;s idea to make the album really long</span><span class="csD5D7D290">?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">[</span><span class="cs43C038A">Laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] It was Michael&#39;s idea. It was long. He didn&#39;t make that transition of doing shorter albums, and this is the guy...it was literally nine songs on Thriller. We actually had that conversation where I was like, &quot;You should make it 10 songs and that&#39;s it.&quot; You never know... maybe he felt like that would be his last album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: Do you still listen to it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Sometimes. A couple of weeks ago, I listened to it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo;: Does it make you sad?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jerkins: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Not at all. I&#39;m sad inside that I lost a friend. He always wanted his music to touch the masses. And that&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s doing right now. But it was an amazing period of time in my life to be able to work with him. It feels incredible to know... I handled his last number one record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Teddy Riley, album co-producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://hiphopwired.com/2830/when-heaven-can-wait-teddy-riley-remembers-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Hip-Hop Wired&rdquo; (July 8, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330181724/https://hiphopwired.com/2830/when-heaven-can-wait-teddy-riley-remembers-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">HipHopWired: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">How were those sessions in comparison to sessions for </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dangerous/Blood On The Dance Floor</span><span class="csD5D7D290">?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Teddy Riley:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was more of a modern day session on Invincible as opposed to Dangerous.

We did the music that we love.

It&#39;s been in the works for a while and it is just a wonderful album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: Was this a difficult or easy album to make?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce: Actually, working with Michael is not difficult at all. Never has been. There can be moments when something isn&#39;t working and it gets tense. But Michael is very easy to work with.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: You&#39;ve been a longtime, exclusive Monster Cable user on all your projects and have been passionate about advocating the benefits of using high performance cable. Was Michael&#39;s new disc INVINCIBLE recorded with Monster?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce: Absolutely! In fact, every vocal of Michael&#39;s was recorded with Monster Cable. And, the entire album was mixed with Monster Cable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: Can you recall the first time you and Michael heard the Monster sonic difference?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce: Well, Michael and I were both in the control room when we first evaluated Monster Cable with a connection between the console and the tape machine. Me, Michael, and Quincy Jones &mdash;all three of us were knocked out by the dramatically noticeable enhancement in sound quality, particularly in clarity and low end response. Now, I can&#39;t live without my Monster Cable!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: [Michael being a perfectionist] seems to be the resounding sentiment from those who work with Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce: I&#39;ve recorded everybody, as you can imagine- Nat Cole, Sarah Vaughan, Ella, you name them, I&#39;ve recorded them. Michael is without qualification one of the best musicians and vocalists I&#39;ve ever recorded. And oh, he is a detailed man. For instance, when we record a vocal session, he brings in his vocal coach and warms up for 2 hours before he gets up in front of the mic! Yeah, for 1 or 2 takes he&#39;ll do that. I&#39;ve worked with Michael for close to 25 years, and it&#39;s always been this way. He&#39;s definitely dedicated and he&#39;s a musician&#39;s musician. Another example, we&#39;ll be working away in the studio and all of the sudden I hear, &quot;clank, clank, bang, scrape,&quot; and he&#39;s out there moving the tube traps around in the room to change the acoustics!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: Did Michael do a lot of the writing for the album or were outside Bruce &mdash;Michael did a lot of it, but there is some outside writing. You know though that Michael always shapes everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: And different producers this time out, as well?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce: There&#39;s Michael, of course. Rodney Jerkins, Teddy Riley and a guy named Dr. Freeze. We had some very young people producing and programming. Rodney Jerkins did an absolutely masterful job of combining classic Michael Jackson R&amp;B with the modern grooves and sounds. Then there was Teddy Riley of course who is just incredible. It&#39;s going to be very interesting when this thing hits the street.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster: Michael&#39;s music is really timeless. You can hum just about anything he&#39;s written. He must be a real fan of melody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce: Absolutely. One thing that you will always hear Michael say is, &quot;Show me the melody!&quot; He&#39;s done some incredible music. Fortunately I&#39;ve been there for all of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-052-michael-prince-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 52 (March 19, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So what was your first in-the-studio experience with Michael Jackson for an album project?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was the Invincible album. Basically, as soon as the tour ended... Brad took me aside and said, &quot;Look, Michael wants us to start working on new material right away. Would you be interested in that?&quot; And of course I was. Basically, we set up--well, Brad already had a nice recording studio at his house, we set up a second one up in the living room, much like we would set up at Michael&#39;s ranch, where you have a bunch of keyboards and samplers, and drum machines, and sequencers, and Pro Tools, and things like that. And so, Michael could get an idea, or Brad could go to the ranch and take some notes and come back, and then we&#39;d start working on music, and we were working on stuff that, actually, has never come out like-- and we still laugh about these titles, they&#39;re all working titles, but one was called, &quot;Bio&quot;, and one was called &quot;Monster&quot;, and, oh gosh, there were a couple others that I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head, &#39;cause I haven&#39;t thought of them in years. But, literally, within a week, we were set up at Brad&#39;s house, working on new songs already.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Sounds like you guys were working on some pretty phenomenal stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I mean, we started on a lot of those songs, like I said, at Brad&#39;s house, and it was &nbsp;at least six months or eight months before we went to our first official recording studio, which was--I want to say we went to Record One first, but we might have gone to the Record Plant first, I&#39;m not really sure which place we went to first, because we bumped around. You know, we&#39;d go to the studio for a while, and then we&#39;d go back to either the ranch or Brad&#39;s house, and then we&#39;d go to the studio for a little while and then once it hit second or third gear, then we were pretty much in the studio for the whole rest of the project, but we worked on that for the better part of four years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So the group of [Invincible] songs that you worked on, were they sort of the ones that were Michael&#39;s own--the songs he wrote, like &quot;Speechless&quot; and &quot;The Lost Children&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I worked primarily on those songs and also on the songs with Dr. Freeze, Elliot Straite, and--</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;, and then what eventually came out as &quot;Blue Gangsta&quot; and &quot;A Place With No Name&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I worked on that, &quot;A Place With No Name&quot;, even though somebody in the Estate or Sony forgot to put my name on there, that&#39;s ok. Actually, Freeze had quite a few songs that I think were probably destined to be on the album and then Rodney came in with a whole team--it&#39;s not just Rodney, it&#39;s like four other guys, five other people--and they went nonstop. I think Rodney realized what a huge opportunity that would be, and so they basically worked 24 hours a day. They had cots set up in the studio, and they would take turns sleeping. It was amazing. And the funny thing was, they had these two engineers working with them, and they were twin brothers. So one would work 12 hours and go home, the other one would show up, work 12 hours, and go home. Finally, I think they pulled Brad aside, or they pulled somebody aside and they go, &quot;Look, we need a break&quot; And they go, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Well, we&#39;ve been doing this for three weeks now. Literally 7 days a week, 12 hours a day&quot;... I think, at some point, they brought in a third engineer, so they could all get a little bit more downtime, you know? But that was a really crazy time. We had--that was at Record One. We had the entire place, there&#39;s two beautiful rooms there, and we were in one room with basically Michael&#39;s songs Freeze&#39;s songs with Bruce Swedien and Mike Ging. And then the other room had--and I went back and forth between both rooms--but the other room was primarily those two twin brothers... And then the project, one day, they make a little announcement, &quot;Hey, we&#39;re going to the Hit Factory in New York.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh great! When?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Tomorrow&quot;, so it&#39;s like, you had to get all the tapes and label them so that, when they got shipped--we had to copy them first, so there would be backups-- but all the tapes, and I&#39;m talking hundreds of tapes by then, like the big 2-inch tapes and the Sony 1-inch or half-inch tapes that went on the new Sony digital machine, that was an amazing machine. It had 48 tracks on it. And we were still using Pro Tools as well. And once we were happy with stuff in Pro Tools, it would usually get transferred to a tape machine, because Bruce Swedien still felt more comfortable dealing with tape and knowing there&#39;s a rewind button, and a play button, and a fast forward button, and a [unintelligible] button, makes sense. And some songs had so many tracks, we&#39;d have 240 8 tracks hooked up to each other, which gives you 96 tracks and a Pro Tools system all slaved to timecode. And that again was a big experience for me, just going from a) my studio, b) all the rock projects I had done up to then, which were pretty much either 24-track or sometimes they&#39;d do 32-track or something, but never had I seen 248-track machines hooked up to each other. Going like, &quot;How could you possibly fill up that many tracks?&quot; Well, you can. Because Michael loved nice, big intros, and some of them were orchestral. Well, you needed a whole bunch of tracks for that, and that may only be the first 45 seconds of the song. But you still had to have the tracks available for that. Sometimes there were so many track that you would take the intro and make a stereo mix of that, which is called a comp, and then you&#39;d always save the master tape of that, but from then on, now that Michael was happy with the mix, and Bruce was happy with the mix, now you just had to deal with that as just a stereo part, which would happen a lot, with other things like background vocals, because Michael would do, like, thirty tracks of background vocals. And same thing with the choir. You&#39;d have, on certain songs, like Andrae Crouch&#39;s choir and you&#39;d have mics all over the room. but at some point, you would make a stereo comp of the choir. Once everybody&#39;s happy with it, why not leave it as a stereo track and free up more tracks to do even more things on? It was amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was the final track list decided by Michael? What were the politics around getting that final track list together?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I can tell you with 99.99% assurity that Michael picked all the songs. He was the boss, and it was the songs that he wanted on that album. And I&#39;m sure he took input, like if Bruce said, &quot;Oh, Michael, this song&#39;s amazing&quot; or if Rodney said, &quot;Mike, I think this is one of the best ones we&#39;ve done&quot;, I&#39;m sure Michael took that to heart. But, in the end, Michael was the one who would go home with CD&#39;s of all the songs and listen to them, and want changes on them, and then come back and have the changes made. I&#39;m sure he made the final song selection.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &#39;Cause there&#39;s some beautiful songs that didn&#39;t make it, like &quot;Xscape&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve Had Enough&quot;, which is in my top ten MJ songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &quot;We&#39;ve Had Enough&quot; is amazing. I remember listening to that about a year after the album came out and going like--and I also felt &quot;Xscape&quot; should&#39;ve been on the album, personally. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did [the fallout with Sony] seem to be bubbling up during the recording process, or did it come as a surprise to the people that were involved in the recording?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, there&#39;s two separate tiers or plateaus as far as your question goes. The first one was slowly bubbling to the surface during the making of the album, because it was so over-budget. Sony wasn&#39;t very happy with the budget, and, believe me, I won&#39;t mention any numbers, it was me coming from doing rock records for like $100,000, you could&#39;ve done about 20 or 30 of them. But you have to remember, if Michael wants to go to the Hit Factory, and rent out three rooms, and have all of us stay at the Four Seasons for six months, that costs a lot of money, a lot of money. I can only imagine. So there was initially a little, &quot;When is this gonna be done? When is this gonna be done? When is this gonna be done? This should&#39;ve been done by now&quot;, and I think Michael felt a little pressure at the end, but, honestly, I think they got all that stuff sorted out in early 2001. And we went down to Criterion, Florida, and sort of finished the album down there, sort of got a nice, new floor to vibe, and that&#39;s when Teddy came down there with his bus--he has a recording studio in his bus. And Bruce was in a room, and Rodney was in another room, and everything kind of finally felt like, &quot;Ok, this is gonna be done in a couple months&quot; and it was. And so, obviously, no company--record company or other company wants to spend too much money on something, but, long story short, it finally got done, everybody was happy with the record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What changes did you notice in Michael the father?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I think he always was a very, very kind and loving human being. One of the most incredible people you could ever meet. And the most wonderful thing that happened, I think, and it&#39;s trivial in a lot of ways, and it&#39;s almost meant to be funny, is that the hours that he would work became much more predictable, which were wonderful. Like I didn&#39;t have to sleep with a cell phone on my chest every night. I&#39;d wait for a phone call at 4 o&#39;clock in the morning, because Michael, once he had the kids, he went to bed earlier, he got a good night&#39;s sleep, he got up early, and there was a lot more schedule and routine in his life than when there weren&#39;t kids. I mean, you could think you were gonna have this wonderful three-day holiday weekend off, and you&#39;d get a call from Michael on Friday morning, going, &quot;Ok, let&#39;s work this weekend&quot;, and you&#39;d go, &quot;What?&quot;-- you wouldn&#39;t go, &quot;What?&quot;, you&#39;d say, &quot;Yes, of course&quot;. And you&#39;d go up to the ranch and tell your family, &quot;Well, cancel the plans that we had, &#39;cause I&#39;m gonna be gone for three or four days&quot;. And Brad would have to do the same thing, but, yeah, there was a lot more rhythm in his life, structure, as far as bedtime, and he was a great, doting dad. I mean, he put those kids to bed most of the time. Spent a lot more time, if I&#39;m not mistaken, at the Ranch and we were set up at the Ranch for quite a long while. We were still working on new songs all the time... That was one thing, he had this artistic streak in him that didn&#39;t stop. So just because an album was done, he still had ideas coming into his head all the time. And he needed to get those recorded somehow, even if they were just gonna be bookmarked and saved for later. I used to call those songs &quot;whips&quot;, works-in-progress. So sometimes you would get something up to a certain level, and we&#39;d just move on to another song. But that&#39;s why at Brad&#39;s place we have this giant case full of things we call &quot;song packets&quot; so every song we&#39;ve ever started, has a &quot;song packet&quot;, it has usually like a lyric sheet, and early cassettes or DATs... CDs, rough mixes, and very, very early versions of songs, and titles that were just working titles that were not the final titles and things like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Songs with--I can never say his name right Walter [Afanasieff]...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, &quot;Walter A.&quot;, I call him &quot;Walter A.&quot; I gave up trying to say his name.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There&#39;s three or four Invincible-era songs that--and &quot;Fall Again&quot;, I know, is one of them. We all know that one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh wow, great song. Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I get the sense that Invincible, even though he took a lot of time on it--was it kind of a rushed album? It just seems like there&#39;s so much left on the table.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, no, it&#39;s that--he shifted gears a couple times. Originally, I think &quot;Neff U&quot; was going to be one of the major contributors to that record, as well as Michael and the songs he was writing with Brad, as well as Davy Foster, and just some really well-known writers. And I didn&#39;t know this until I talked to Teddy in 2010 on the &quot;Michael&quot; album, Rodney was mentored by Teddy, right? And Teddy had spoken to Michael about Rodney very highly. He even said, &quot;Man, this kid is just on it. He just writes incredible drum beats...&quot; and so, I think, once he told Michael that, and Michael called Rodney and Rodney came in with his crew, Michael really thought, &quot;Well maybe I should build this album around Rodney like I sorta built Dangerous around Teddy.&quot;, to a certain extent. And so, like I said, a bunch of &quot;Neff U&quot;&#39;s ideas just went *rocket noise*, you know what I mean? And he ended up with one song on that record. So there&#39;s definitely a lot of stuff that was in the fringes that probably should not have been dropped and should have gone on the record, but, like I said, I think those decisions were really Michael&#39;s in the very end... I know he&#39;s written stuff with Babyface. I know that, I think Jermaine was getting ready to work with--it was either L.A. and Babyface, or Jam and Lewis. I get the story mixed up... And Jermaine was getting ready to start a project with them and then, this was during I think the Invincible time, and Michael called them and hired them for six months and never used any song they wrote with him. And I might be wrong, it could be the HIStory era, but it was one of those things where he just said, &quot;Well, if they&#39;re that good, I want to work with them&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Dr. Freeze (Elliot Straite), co-writer and co-producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjfrance.com/actu/post/2011/01/28/Interview-exclusive%3A-Dr.-Freeze-fait-des-r%C3%A9v%C3%A9lations-sur-le-prochain-album.../3233"><span class="cs8567212B">MJFrance interview</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://michaeljacksonbeat.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/dr-freeze-on-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">translated</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quagmire: I&#39;m eager to hear how you began working with Michael Jackson and how he contacted you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Freeze: I knew his manager, John McClain, and I was working on an album with my partners, Spydermann. After completing the album, it did not go as planned and we had to cancel the project. I was very upset. And then John McClain said, &quot;Do not worry Freeze. I have another project for you. You&#39;ll be in business with Michael.&quot; I said: &quot;Michael ... who?&quot; And he said: &quot;Michael Jackson!&quot; I did not believe it at first and I thought it was crazy. And then one day I was on the phone with my father and someone called me on the other line...And it was Michael! That&#39;s how it all began. I had some songs that I made for Michael. He adored them! Because Michael and I, we have a knack for melody. So every time I proposed something, it was easy for him to study the song because it was as if he already knew. I gave him some songs that he adored. He cherished them. That&#39;s how we met.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: So you suggest songs hmm...No doubt Michael adores most of his work. As I understand, he loved every bit of &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot;, and from there he decided to focus on this particular song. What happened next?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: We were recording, went studio hopping, re-registered, and recorded more songs. You know, &quot;A Place With No Name&quot; and &quot;Gangsta Blue&quot; were recorded at the same time. There are also some others I can not speak of now. But other songs were recorded. We saved a lot but these three songs were our three main objectives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What was your mindset in the first day in the studio with him? How did you feel?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: It was pretty scary for me! I felt like I was back in primary school and not knowing anything about the production! With Michael I relearned everything. The other producers and I were as students facing a teacher. With Michael, it was as if we knew nothing more to the business: we had to start over and relearn everything. He taught us to do everything the best way possible: Michael was a perfectionist and we had to start from scratch to produce the music the best possible way. I was very nervous, very nervous but very honored! Anyway, Michael was more nervous with me than I were with him. He was simply the most wonderful person with whom you could never dream of working with. It was great! He knew all about the music industry, everything about everything, nothing was foreign to him, and he taught me a lot. Finally, he was very humble and creative. It was really great to work with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What were your feelings about Michael when you got to know him a little better in the studio?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: It taught me not only to create a song correctly, but it also gave me advice on the music industry as a whole. My main feeling is that he was an absolute genius. I was fortunate to learn from one of the greatest entertainers of all time. I try to apply his advice to the projects I undertake today: I try to keep alive the artistic spirit of Michael Jackson. It&#39;s like if I graduated from the University of Michael Jackson. Anyway, getting back to your question, the word &quot;feeling&quot; is too low. There is no word strong enough to describe what I learned and lived with the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Do you have any anecdotes about your studio sessions?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Not really. I had great fun working with him. Michael was someone who loved to make funny jokes. He really opened up about many topics, video games, etc...Then resumed his work. We were amazed at his performance. It happened like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Did he warm up a lot vocally recording the track?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Anyone who is warm, either in sports or singing. We never saw him do his vocal exercises before us, but when he came into the studio to record, he stood before the microphone and set fire to the song. As he left, the studio was in ashes and our jaws on the floor. It was really impressive to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: You mentioned video games earlier. Do you remember the games you played with him at the time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: In his house, he had plenty of video games. Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and also Flight Simulator. We spent a lot of time playing them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Were you playing in the studio or at Neverland?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, I went to Neverland, to relax and work. We worked a lot there. He had a studio at the ranch. So I was working there and sometimes he would say: &quot;Come on, take a break Freeze! Go and have a little fun, watch a movie, engage in an attraction or take a stroll to the zoo!&quot; Neverland was a bit like a second home to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: I did not know you worked at Neverland! It&#39;s interesting because we do not have many details on the studio of Neverland. Was it a professional studio?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, completely, There was a lot of professional equipment, Pro Tools, stuff like that, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Did he use it alone?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Absolutely, as soon as Michael was talking about an unbeatable studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: In fact, we know he could not really play an instrument, so we always wondered if he was able to record anything on his own without the help of an engineer or producer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: He could do everything himself. You know, Michael was truly a &quot;living instrument&quot;. He could play some chords on a keyboard, he was doing pretty good. He also knew programmed beats.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Have you done other songs with Michael Jackson, other than these three?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: We did some other songs, I do not think we&#39;ve finalized anything. I&#39;m not sure I can tell you much more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Overall, how many songs did you write for Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Oh, about thirty, and I had to save five or six of &#39;em.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: And you have these songs in your possession today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Most of his novels are in the coffers now. We have no control over them. They keep everything in the chests.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: So is the hands of the Estate?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, absolutely. John McClain is responsible for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Is he the boss!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, the boss!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Were you able to hear new songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, I could listen to most of them. But I can not say anything, sorry. I&#39;m not allowed to disclose anything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Let&#39;s play a little game instead. I&#39;ll give you the names of songs, and you tell me whether or not you&#39;ve heard &#39;em. Have you heard &quot;Escape&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: &quot;Escape&quot;? That tells me nothing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: &quot;Fear,&quot; &quot;Face&quot;, does that tell you something?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No, nothing at all</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Have you listened to &quot;Do You Know Where Your Children Are?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: I&#39;ve heard it in the studios.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: &quot;Crack Kills&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Never heard of that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: The &quot;gloved One&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: In fact, it would be easier if you give us some names...Could you give us the name of an unreleased track that you particularly marked and talk a little?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: There&#39;s a song we made together, but I do not know if he has completed his vocal parts. It&#39;s called &quot;Rise Above It All&quot;. It&#39;s a song I wrote and on which we worked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What was it about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: It&#39;s an upbeat song. If you feel bad, if things are going wrong in the world, be positive and try to be as happy as possible, leaving aside all the negative things. Overcome negativity, go beyond the woes of the world, all wars, the starving children and all the bad things. Assemble yourselves, hold your hand, raise your hands to heaven and pass it all. It&#39;s a little theme song. I can not say whether he had recorded the song, but in any case, we worked on it. There are other songs on which they collaborated. Most of these songs are mid-tempo, but I can not say anything more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quagmire: Have you talked with John McClain of songs that you recorded with Michael and what he intended to do with them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Freeze: No. It&#39;s hard to go directly into contact with John McClain, he is very busy. The subject has not yet been addressed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Any shoot-up of your recording sessions?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No, no cameras were allowed. You know, he disliked being photographed and being filmed in the studio. Therefore, it was forbidden.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Earlier in the interview, you said he was programming beats and played the keyboard in front of you. Can you tell us more?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Sometimes, he naturally created songs, and when he did hear me, I was stunned. Essentially, it was just ideas thrown here and there, depending on the emotion in which he stood. It was in the creative process and he loved it. From dusk till dawn, he created sounds, melodies, harmonies. It was quite an experience for me. I learned a lot from him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Which studios did you record in?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: We recorded in several studios. Sometimes in New York, sometimes in California. We spent much time at the ranch. In fact, the choice depended mainly on the studio where it was geographically. We went through the Hit Factory in New York, and if my memory serves me right, &quot;Record One&quot; in Los Angeles. We also used the studio of John McClain and recorded at Neverland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: So he worked on other projects when you were there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Yes, he was working on other songs. He sometimes asked me my opinion. Sometimes I&#39;ve worked a bit with him. But hey, I was not alone. There were some other producers who were with him as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: When you have finished the sessions with him, did you know that they were finished or did you expect that he&#39;ll get back to work on other songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: As soon as we started recording together, I knew that I would dedicate myself totally. I only wanted to work with Michael. I had promised never to work with anyone else. It was a full time job: I worked with him for years. I was in the studio with him shortly before his death.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Do you remember your impression when you first met? Was it as you imagined? Were you surprised or disappointed by his character?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: I already knew that Michael was the most humble person you could meet. He was my best friend, the most beautiful meeting of my life. It&#39;s like a meeting with Captain Kirk frankly, who does not like Captain Kirk? This fictional character was cool, friendly and he was a nice guy. And although Michael was a bit like that. As you can imagine, I am a true fan of Star Trek, and that&#39;s why I speak of Captain Kirk...Meet Michael Jackson, was a bit like if I met Captain Kirk, it was just unbelievable. Today, there are more stars with the same aura. I was really amazed when I met him and my parents are very proud of me: not only have I managed to work with the King of Pop, but it was not limited to a mere professional relationship. I became his friend, his best friend. I love him to death, even today. We were like brothers, very close, so yeah, to summarize, my meeting with Michael, it was as if I had become friendly with Captain Kirk!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Michael is universally recognized as the greatest artist. You met him and you became one of his friends. Do you have any anecdotes about him we would not know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: It was incredible, a genius. He was an angel, which is also why his name was Michael. Yeah, he was truly an angel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Were there any requests for special equipment for recording, such as microphones or instruments? Were there any special requirements?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: No, he did not care as it sounded good. He could sing something in his notebook and save it like that, it did not bother him as it was a good melody or a tube power.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What engineers have participated in your recording sessions?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: From memory, there was Prince Michael, Brad and Mike Dean Buxer. There was also Bruce Swedien, of course. I have not worked directly with him but I know him very well, it&#39;s very cool. Another genius.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Did he complete some of your songs, or did you finalize everything alone, mixing included?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: There are engineers who have reworked some songs. I do not know who made the final mixes. I would have asked John McClain...I do not know who worked on these songs with Michael, I was not there physically.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What is the thing that you are most impressed with Michael, artistically speaking?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">F: Michael loved his fans, he loved his music and he loved making music for his fans. He liked to give love and joy to people. It was his mission. He was very dedicated and loyal. It was something he wanted to do, or that he had to do. He loved people from the depths of his soul. And when he made this music, he did for us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Leon &ldquo;Ndugu&rdquo; Chandler, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;Sometimes during those latter days on that last record, he would never come into the studio. He would just drive around in his car and produce from the car. That&#39;s kind of the way it was with the rhythm section. He would say, &#39;Make sure you play the fill going into the bridge.&#39; I can understand that, he&#39;s got to be in a lot of places.&quot;</span></p></body>
