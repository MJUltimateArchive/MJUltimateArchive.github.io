I had no idea what was happening. A crazy moment. Can you imagine, your phone is ringing and next someone is saying Michael Jackson wants to record a song of yours? The producer said Michael Jackson heard my song and wanted to work with me. The next thing I know I am on a plane to Miami to work with Teddy Riley. Later on Michael came to the sessions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael made notes and did drawings on the lyric sheet in the studio which Beal still owns. He was told to sell it, but had no intention of doing so.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Are you crazy,&rdquo; he told his friend. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s like having a kid. You can&rsquo;t sell it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Nate Smith, co-writer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7647828/nate-smith-pages-gretchen-parlato-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">Billboard interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Billboard: You also have a credit on a Michael Jackson song, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nate Smith: I was a grad student at Virginia Commonwealth University, and I was producing -- as I always have -- R&amp;B music. It&#39;s a part of my life that jazz fans and listeners don&#39;t really know about. I was just making demos in my bedroom, and I met a guy who knew a guy, who knew a guy, who knew Teddy Riley. One of the tracks that I wrote ended up in Teddy&#39;s hands as he was soliciting songs to Michael Jackson for the Invincible album. One of the songs I wrote became made the album -- it&#39;s called &quot;Heaven Can Wait.&quot; It came out in 2001...it was a long and winding road. [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] It remains the biggest and most miraculous accident of my career. It&#39;s something I definitely plan to return to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the Michael Jackson thing happened, I wasn&#39;t prepared for it at all. For the first two weeks after that record came out, every A&amp;R would take my call. I could get any meeting I wanted. But I&#39;d roll up to the meeting, and I didn&#39;t have anything to play for them! I didn&#39;t have a catalog of &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;s. That&#39;s the lesson I learned: be ready. When that kind of opportunity comes, you&#39;ve gotta be ready for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Que (aka <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://myspace.com/iamsoulmusic/music/songs"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Deo.SOUL The GREAT iAM&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">), background vocalist, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those background vocals that you hear include my vocals. I recorded this song back in 2000 as a writer under BMG Publishing. I was called by Teddy Riley to come to Miami in May of 2001 to record Heaven Can Wait backgrounds over again for Michael who requested that I come. So that what I mean when I say that it&rsquo;s me singing the background.

So the modern day is a little quick. Lil&rsquo; Wayne, all those guys, the new cats, they cut a record in an hour. Michael Jackson, Kool &amp; The Gang, Frank Sinatra, they take the time to get all that stuff tuned and get it all right so they are setting up the mood with the sound.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...When I did that song with him, he held his heart and he said &lsquo;Teddy, is this mine?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s yours if you want it, Michael.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;I want it, let&rsquo;s go get it!&rsquo; He was so excited. I have a couple of witnesses that were in the room when he said &lsquo;I want that song. I need that song in my life.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Kenny Quiller, personal assistant to Teddy Riley, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://qcitymetro.com/2009/07/07/a_qcity_man_recalls_time_with_michael_jackson085248848/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q City Metro&rdquo; (July 7, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How many people can say they actually spent quality time with Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Charlotte native Kenny Quiller can.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In fact, he got a song-writing credit on Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; album for the song &quot;Heaven Can wait.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The one-time personal assistant to then-super producer Teddy Riley of Guy and Blackstreet fame, had the fortune of having a song fall in his lap. According to Quiller, a friend left a CD at his house with the song &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; on it. When he heard the song, he knew it would be perfect for Jackson, so he shared it with Riley, who agreed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Riley presented the song to Jackson, the King of Pop loved it and wanted to include it on his album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Quiller didn&rsquo;t write the song, he said Jackson gave him a songwriting credit for the role he played.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Out of all respect for me, and because I found the song, Michael and Ted Riley and the other writers allotted me writers credit,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So what was it like meeting and spending time Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller, along with Riley, met with Jackson several times in 2000-2001 in New York, Virginia Beach and Miami during the production of the song. He said Jackson was nice and didn&rsquo;t roll with a large entourage. He said he got to talk with Jackson&rsquo;s children, Paris and Prince. And yes, nanny Grace Rwaramba was there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One time we were in Virginia watching television and his children asked to turn the television off,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;They said their father only allowed them to watch T.V. once a week and they had already had their T.V. time.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller said the children also listened to classical music while Jackson was working.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller said he and Jackson bonded quickly because they shared a religious background. Both were raised as Jehovah Witnesses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once he shared that information with Jackson, Quiller said, the singer opened up and they talked often.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller said he wants people to know that Jackson was grounded and knew who he was. He said he believes the singer&rsquo;s childhood, stardom and religious background caused him a lot of mental anguish that the average person couldn&rsquo;t understand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Growing up as a Witness, I have insight on why he did what he did and why people thought he was weird and strange,&rdquo; Quiller said. &ldquo;He was just human.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller said he also believes that because Jackson was such a major icon, people expected the pop star to be perfect, and he was not.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He wanted to relate to children because they were innocent and didn&rsquo;t have a motive,&rdquo; Quiller said. &ldquo;The singer was a little na&iuml;ve and the court case brought him back to reality.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller says meeting Jackson was a surreal experience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;For me, it&rsquo;s a sense of completion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Knowing that I met him, took a picture with him and got my name on his album, its completion. It&rsquo;s something that most people would only dream about.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quiller currently works as a barber in Charlotte and has plans to work with up-and-coming producers and songwriters. His wants to get them exposure so their records will get played.</span></p></body>
