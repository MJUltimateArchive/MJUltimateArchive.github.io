That will be a song of mine and a theme for [the &ldquo;Michael Jackson and Friends&rdquo;] shows. We all have to give and we all have to do what we can to help end the needless suffering in the world. The monies raised will go to three organisations-the Nelson Mandela Children&#39;s Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO. I am proud to be associated with these charities who, over the years, have done so much for so many. The people who work for them, often for some in difficult and dangerous situations, have my greatest respect and admiration. What More Can I Give? On behalf of us all I urge everyone to give what they can during these concerts to help these charities continue their life-giving work. My thanks again to President Mandela for allowing us to use his residence to make this announcement. I love you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/X4BzkoqpHrc"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Daily Mirror&rdquo; (April 12, 1999)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mirror: We asked Michael what his reaction was to the crisis in Yugoslavia.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I have to turn the TV off, I cry every day but that&rsquo;s not enough to turn your head and pretend that it doesn&rsquo;t exist, I want to fly down there if I could. &nbsp;I would love to fly there and see and help and do and create. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m giving proceeds to those refugees for the families.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mirror: &nbsp;Are you really?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: Yeah, I wrote a song &ldquo;What More Can I Give&rdquo; that I want to put all the stars together and if I could do it here in Britain it would be great.

It was like it was discriminating the rest of the world. I asked for the Bee Gees, I asked for other groups and they said &ldquo;Well, they weren&rsquo;t born here&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I just want the world to show that they care&rdquo;. I think it&#39;s--I mean, I am not into politics and I don&rsquo;t talk about religion and politics but I think it&rsquo;s totally ignorant--it&rsquo;s wrong to hurt people, to hurt innocent children over some political issue?

Those are our people. Those are our children. Those are our parents.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson says that he hopes to have individual artists take on the verses with all the guests singing together on the chorus. &quot;I want the whole world to sing it, to bring us together as a world,&quot; he says. &quot;Because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over. And we need peace, we need giving, we need love, we need unity.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson debuted the song two years ago as part of a pair of &quot;Michael Jackson and Friends&quot; concerts that benefited the Nelson Mandela Children&#39;s Fund, the Red Cross and Unesco.

For years, this song was called &ldquo;Heal L.A.&rdquo; It was one of those songs with a universal message, which is why Michael resurrected it in the hope of raising millions of dollars for the victims&rsquo; families and survivors in New York. This was a mission that brought together the likes of C&eacute;line Dion, Gloria Estefan, Beyonc&eacute;, Mariah Carey and Usher. They, too, felt that the song&rsquo;s message was powerful and timely, and Michael wanted to share it with the world. But Sony didn&rsquo;t agree and the song wasn&rsquo;t released: it received airplay, but it didn&rsquo;t do what it should have. Creatively speaking, it was a crazy decision. Crazy to everyone but Michael, because he felt that tactical decisions were now being taken to hamper him commercially.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;Sony put the brakes on a full-fledged promotion [for the Invincible album] in October. It kept telling Michael that it had spent $24m on the album and needed an artist who was prepared to promote it. At one point, Michael attempted to win over the situation by playing politics with Tommy, seeking to appease him by inviting his wife, Thalia, to sing on the Spanish version of &ldquo;What More Can I Give?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank Cascio, &ldquo;My Friend Michael&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[After hearing about the plane hitting the first Tower], in a matter of seconds, we packed up our belongings and met Michael, Paris, Prince, Grace, and my brothers Eddie, Dominic, and Aldo at the car. I suggested we head to my parents&rsquo; house, but we soon realized that the bridges to New Jersey were closed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Luckily, one of the security guards was a retired chief of police. He called someone in the police department and got us permission to leave the city. As we crossed the George Washington Bridge, we looked downtown and saw the smoke. The first tower had fallen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Michael said, shaking his head. He started to say something, then looked at Prince, whose eyes were wide and innocent, and closed his mouth. But I know what was going through his head, because soon after we got to New Jersey, he started talking about how he could use the song &ldquo;What More Can I Give&rdquo; to raise money for the survivors and the families of victims of September 11.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael&rsquo;s response to September 11 was swift and generous. He organized a star-studded charity concert called United We Stand: What More Can I Give, in Washington, D.C., with performances by Beyonc&eacute;, Mariah Carey, Al Green, Justin Timberlake, Destiny&rsquo;s Child, Reba McEntire, and twenty-seven other brilliant performers. It took place on October 21, just five weeks after the attacks. The plan was to release the song &ldquo;What More Can I Give&rdquo; as a single to benefit the victims of 9/11, but Tommy Mottola was worried that this would compete for attention with Invincible. Nonetheless, immediately after the concert, Michael brought in Marc Schaffel, an experienced producer, to make a music video. He knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be bound to the label forever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mike Smallcombe, Making Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Only days later he announced his plans to record a charity single called &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo;, in aid of survivors and the families of the victims of the terrorist atrocity. Michael originally began writing the song, then titled &lsquo;Heal L.A.&rsquo;, with Brad Buxer after the Los Angeles riots of 1992. From that point onwards the song evolved, and in 1999 it became &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo;. There were plans to release it in aid of the refugees of the Kosovo War, which ended that year, but they never materialised.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After Michael hired film producer Marc Schaffel in the summer of 2001, the two considered producing a charity record to try to duplicate the success of &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo;. The beneficiaries would be survivors and families linked to the next major humanitarian disaster, which came much sooner than expected with the New York attacks, after which Michael re-wrote the song. &ldquo;I believe in my heart that the music community will come together as one and rally to the aid of thousands of innocent victims,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;There is a tremendous need for relief dollars right now and through this effort each one of us can play an immediate role in helping comfort so many people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By September 20, artists such as Beyonc&eacute;, Usher, Celine Dion, Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Shakira had all agreed to lend their voices, and Schaffel flew around the country in a jet chartered by Michael to record the vocals. A Spanish version, titled &lsquo;Todo Para Ti&rsquo;, was also recorded. According to Schaffel, the two songs cost $ 3 million to put together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael signed away the rights to &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo; to Schaffel in a written contract some time before the terrorist strikes, without consulting his management or lawyers. Schaffel, who was appointed as the project&rsquo;s executive producer, said Michael was so excited about the project that he didn&rsquo;t have to beg him to come to the studio. &ldquo;He really, really, really wanted to make it happen,&rdquo; Schaffel said. &ldquo;He was like a different person when he was like that. He was convinced, and so was I, and so was everyone else, that we had two number one hits here, the English version and the Spanish version, which is actually the better of the two.&rdquo; Michael&rsquo;s label, Sony, agreed to manufacture and distribute the singles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Instead of touring, Michael wanted to use both versions of &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo;, which were ready by November, as a promotional tool for Invincible. But even though Sony had originally agreed to manufacture and distribute the singles it was now refusing to release them, further angering Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to documents, Sony actually refused to release the songs at the behest of Michael&rsquo;s own people. Baffled that he had signed away the valuable rights to &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo; to Marc Schaffel, his advisors launched an investigation into the unknown producer&rsquo;s background. In November 2001 they discovered that Schaffel was a producer and director of gay pornographic videos, triggering a damage-control effort. The advisors did not want Michael linked to Schaffel in any capacity, especially after the child molestation allegations of 1993.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Seemingly without Michael&rsquo;s knowledge, those advisors then asked Sony to terminate the &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo; project, or at least delay it until Michael recovered his rights. The label obliged by refusing legal permission for its stars to appear on the records. As Michael was contracted to Sony, he wasn&rsquo;t even able to get a third-party record company to release the singles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Schaffel &ndash; who was dismissed by Michael&rsquo;s team following the discovery about his background but held onto the rights to &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo; &ndash; refutes that Sony refused to release the singles at the behest of Michael&rsquo;s own people. Instead, he claims the label was concerned the singles would compete with Invincible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marc Schaffel said many [Invincible] events were scheduled, but Michael was suddenly no longer interested in them. &ldquo;That pissed off Tommy, who thought it was all because of &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo;,&rdquo; Schaffel said. &ldquo;And a lot of it was. Michael wanted them to use &lsquo;What More Can I Give&rsquo; to promote Invincible.&rdquo; Michael was apparently unaware that his own advisors stopped the project going ahead due to Schaffel&rsquo;s involvement.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-052-michael-prince-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 52 (March 19, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Talk to us about the history of [What More Can I Give].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290">...Of course it always brings a smile to my face, because... that song, to me, is an amazing song. And you take an amazing song and you look at all the amazing singers that are on there--it&#39;s, like, Luther Vandross&#39;s final performance on anything... I actually have a version with Beyonce singing the entire song, and she kills it. And it wasn&#39;t meant to happen that way--and it&#39;s funny because Beyonce was the first vocalist to come in, because Michael had a scratch vocal on there, and we only had a lyric sheet, and so now the idea was we&#39;re gonna get all these people to sing on it--not we, they are, I&#39;m just the engineer. So the first that comes to the studio we&#39;re gonna work at is Beyonce, and I think she was either still in Destiny&#39;s Child or had just broken away from Destiny&#39;s Child, I&#39;m not really sure, but here&#39;s this incredibly gorgeous woman who can sing like an angel and, at the same time, I&#39;m so used to Michael&#39;s singing, and his singing is perfect. I mean, we didn&#39;t use autotune, we didn&#39;t have to move things around rhythmically, everything was perfect that came out of his mouth. So I just remember with dread the first day, like Michael&#39;s there and then Brad Buxer and I are there, and we&#39;re gonna record Beyonce, and I&#39;m kind of like going, &quot;Oh boy, here we go&quot;, &#39;cause I&#39;m just not expecting it to be anywhere near an MJ-caliber vocal. And so she listens to the song a few times, and basically--if you&#39;ve heard the song, the idea is everybody&#39;s supposed to do one or two lines. So we weren&#39;t really sure yet, because she was the first person, so we go, &quot;Well, if you want to, maybe do most of the first verse, and let&#39;s get you singing on one of the choruses, and maybe some overdubs when you&#39;re ready&quot;, and she went out there, literally, and did the whole song, top to bottom. And my jaw is just dropping, like going like, &quot;This sounds amazing!&quot;. You know what I mean? And all the ad-libs she did at the end are all keepers. Ad libs are hard to do, some people can&#39;t do &#39;em at all, and she just did ad lib after ad lib, and I&#39;m going like, &quot;Well that was better than that one&quot;, and so that&#39;s when I realized how amazingly talented and gifted that woman is. I want to say &quot;girl&quot;, but she&#39;s grown up now, she has some kids, so I&#39;ll say woman. What a wonderful experience that was, and it really opened up my eyes to how many other amazing vocalists there are in this wonderful world. But let me drop back to 1996 real quick. When I first started working on the tour, I had two jobs. One was working on the tour, and the second one was working as Brad Buxer&#39;s assistant. In his hotel room, we had a studio set up. It was called an HRS, which stands for &quot;hotel room system&quot;, and he had the biggest one. He had nice, big Tannoy speakers and amplifiers, and samplers, drum machines, Pro Tools, keyboards, everything you would need to literally do an album if you needed to do an album. And so one of the first things I hear is this song, it&#39;s called &quot;Heal L.A.&quot;. And I never asked why it was called &quot;Heal L.A.&quot;, at least for a year or so, but that was something that Brad was always adding a new string part to, and Michael wanted a more complex intro, and pretty much is the intro that you hear, like that orchestral thing with the horns. And so I found out later, the reason it was called &quot;Heal L.A.&quot;, it was done after the L.A. riots after the Rodney King trial--it wasn&#39;t his trial, it was the police officers that beat him up--when they all got off scot-free, which they shouldn&#39;t have. Michael wrote a song because he wanted everybody to listen to it, and it was all gonna be about &quot;L.A. needs to come together&quot; and so &quot;Heal L.A.&quot; was this perfect title. Well, by the time the song came out, 5 years later, we couldn&#39;t call it &quot;Heal L.A.&quot; anymore, Michael had to sort of come up with a new lyric and a new name for it, and that&#39;s when it changed. I think it was either 2000, probably 2000 or 2001, it became &quot;What More Can I Give&quot;. And I can&#39;t remember if we had vocals, if Michael actually sang like a chorus that said &quot;Heal L.A.&quot; or maybe it was just called &quot;Heal L.A.&quot; and Michael always had the melody in his head. I&#39;d have to go back to some of my old, old, old hard drives and listen to it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you recall or remember any of the sort of conversations Michael had with you around the song in his vision for the song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Michael really felt that this was going to be bigger than &quot;We Are the World&quot;, and I thought it was going to be too. And I think Brad did too, and I think Bruce Swedien who mixed it masterfully did too. And by then, this whole thing with Tommy Mottola and Sony was sort of in full swing. They gave the song their blessing... &#39;cause they got a list of all the artists that Michael wanted to put on there, and I think they thought it couldn&#39;t be done. And they said, &quot;If you can get all these artists on here, we&#39;ll absolutely get behind this and put it out&quot;. Well, they did get all those artists on there. And then Michael even did Tommy Mottola a favor, and put his new wife Thal&iacute;a on the Spanish version called &quot;Todo para T&iacute;&quot;. We did a version in Spanish that we worked on with a guy named Casey Porter, who re-wrote the lyrics in Spanish. It&#39;s beautiful. That one has Shakira and a whole other [bunch of] people that I don&#39;t really know. I recorded &#39;em all, but I don&#39;t speak Spanish very well. So we had an English version and a Spanish version, the Spanish-speaking market is huge, all of central and south America. That song should&#39;ve gone through the roof, but in the very last minute, I remember being at the studio, and it was actually Tommy Mottola came down there and co-produced Thal&iacute;a when I was recording her... Very nice lady, good voice. And at some point in time, I guess Tommy Mottola decided Sony was not gonna release that song, and the only thing that they could think of, with very little time and wanting to get this thing out, is some sort of an Internet release. And I&#39;ve since talked to the guy that bank-rolled most of that song, Mark Schaffel, and he goes, &quot;Well Michael, you probably don&#39;t remember this, but we put it online for sale&quot;. And it was like $1.00 or something like that. And he said the next morning was when they raided the ranch, and I went, &quot;What?&quot;, and I didn&#39;t realize all the things how they were mapped out on a calendar, but he says so what they ended up doing was, after less than 24 hours, the song was pulled out, and it never went back up for sale.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&#39;m curious to know whether a solo version of [What More Can I Give] exists?

He knew that was going to be a scratch vocal track, right? So it was never his intention for that to be heard. In fact, once Beyonce sang the entire track, Michael pulled Brad and I aside, and he said, &quot;From now on, when you fly around and recording other vocalists, play them Beyonce&#39;s version&quot; And I went, &quot;Ok&quot;. Because she nailed it. And her vocal performance was a lot more robust than Michael&#39;s &#39;cause Michael never intended for that to be the final vocal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ziggy Marley, singer, &ldquo;Spinner&rdquo; (July 7, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://repeatingislands.com/2009/07/13/ziggy-marley%E2%80%99s-duet-with-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190214/https://repeatingislands.com/2009/07/13/ziggy-marley%E2%80%99s-duet-with-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Admin Note: Ziggy Marley&rsquo;s vocals appear on &ldquo;What More Can I Give&rdquo;; Marley may have just been unaware of the song at this point in time]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the many recording tracks left in musical limbo after Michael Jackson&rsquo;s death features the vocals of Ziggy Marley. Jackson called Marley shortly after 9/11, asking him to add guest vocals to a song. Marley obliged, but never heard back, and the song, as far as he knows, was never released. &ldquo;Michael called me when I was in the studio,&rdquo; Marley tells Spinner, &ldquo;and I spoke to him and he said he really needs me to do this, and he gave me a whole thing about what it was about.&rdquo; Marley recorded a vocal, but never followed up. He&rsquo;s not sure if the song was ever completed, noting, &ldquo;Somebody has to find out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ziggy, eldest son of Bob Marley, met Michael Jackson for the first time in 1974, when the Jackson 5 visited Jamaica. &nbsp;Ziggy, now 40, says, &ldquo;I was really young, and he was much older than me, but it was a big deal.
