It&#39;s very loving.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: You&#39;ll be surprised. I was with these kids in Germany, and we had a big water-balloon fight - I&#39;m serious - and I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote &quot;Speechless&quot;. Fun inspires me. I hate to say that, because it&#39;s such a romantic song. But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in it&#39;s entirety right there. I felt it would be good enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.allmichaeljackson.com/interviews/onlineaudiochat.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Getmusic.com interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anthony DeCurtis: Now we have Vernay who writes to us from Newark, Delaware, the good ole USA, and Vernay says, &quot;I&#39;m so pleased with the new album but I was particularly touched by Speechless. What was your inspiration for this song?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: Speechless was inspired to me by, um, I spend a lot of time in the forest. I like to go into the forest and I like to climb trees. My favorite thing is to climb trees, go all the way up to the top of a tree and I look down on the branches. Whenever I do that it inspires me for music. There are these two sweet little kids, a girl and a boy, and they&#39;re so innocent; they&#39;re the quintessential form of innocence, and just being in their presence I felt completely speechless, &#39;cause I felt I was looking in the face of God whenever I saw them. They inspired me to write Speechless.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, audio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.michaeljackson.ch/2001an.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">Monster Cable interview (June 11, 2001</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Monster Cable: You are certainly one of the elite in Michael Jackson&#39;s entourage, having the privilege of documenting every step of the creative process, as Michael makes it happen. What was a standout moment during the recording sessions this time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bruce Swedien: Everything with Michael is a stand out moment, but an absolutely gorgeous piece of music called &quot;Speechless&quot; was really an event. Michael sings the first 8 bars a cappella. At the end he closes it off a cappella. It was Michael&#39;s idea to add the a capella parts. We also had the Andrae Crouch choir on it. I used my Neumann U-47 tube microphone that I bought new in 1956! No one has ever used it. Of course the signal path is the microphone through Monster Cable and direct to tape. The sound is just spectacular.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At first, we tried it a day or two, and the a cappella just didn&#39;t work. His mood and his feeling&hellip;it just didn&#39;t work. With Michael, it&#39;s a deal where you don&#39;t just walk up to the mic and sing a piece of music and that&#39;s it. That&#39;s just not the way it works. We worked a couple of days on this particular thing and he called me in the evening and said, &quot;Bruce it&#39;s not right, we have to do it again.&quot; But, he&#39;s a perfectionist.</span></p></body>
