Michael decided to join him, and stayed in a two-bedroom condo belonging to the producer. Getting away from New York enabled Michael to focus for the first time in many months, and he spent two weeks recording with Riley at his Future Records studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the songs that stood out for Riley at this time was called &lsquo;Whatever Happens&rsquo;. The song, which is about a girl who discovers that she is pregnant, came from an artist signed to Riley&rsquo;s label. &ldquo;We were going to sign him to Interscope, but this guy started tripping out,&rdquo; Riley said. &ldquo;So I ended up going to the writers of that song [Gil Cang and Geoffrey Williams] and asked them could I produce the song for Michael. They let me do it.&rdquo; Michael also received a writing credit, even though he did not write the song. For decades, less established songwriters have been forced to give up a slice of their publishing rights as part of the condition of having their song recorded by the superstar artist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Riley wanted a 40-piece orchestra to perform strings on &lsquo;Whatever Happens&rsquo;, and Carlos Santana to play guitar. &ldquo;Michael was like, &lsquo;Okay, we will make that happen,&rsquo; I wanted &lsquo;Whatever Happens&rsquo; to be special,&rdquo; Riley said. But Santana was spending time with his family and didn&rsquo;t want to leave his San Francisco home to travel to the East Coast, so he recorded his parts at his home studio. The musician admitted he was honoured to receive the call, and the respect was mutual. &ldquo;He [Santana] was the nicest man,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so kind and so spiritual. I found him to be so humble, so I said to myself, &lsquo;We have to make this work&rsquo;.&rdquo; Michael also loved the improvisation of Santana&rsquo;s whistling, which can be heard at the beginning of the track, and kept it on the final recording.</span></p></body>
