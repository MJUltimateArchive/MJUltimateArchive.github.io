He sang all the parts, whether the piano in the middle of the song, or those sheets of synth on the chorus. Everything is his. On this song, so I simply carried out his ideas. With two sound engineers, it has even been singing the word &quot;Morphine&quot; on the chorus. It was very fun &hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Slash, guitarist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104437/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article16.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; magazine (August 1995)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: How does Jackson work?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Slash: With Michael, the initial tracks that I get to play on are completely bare of vocals, usually just some drums and a little bit of bass, so it&#39;s hard to even know what key the song&#39;s in. So, I just make up a bunch of stuff and they pick what they want. I did one thing, two things a day, and then they&#39;d say all right, we&#39;ll call you back tomorrow. They wouldn&#39;t call me back for three months. All of a sudden, I&#39;d get this phone call out of the blue--can you come back?--so I&#39;d come back and then they&#39;d say, OK, we&#39;ll call you tomorrow. And then three months would go by... I guess I&#39;m on two songs on his new record. I don&#39;t know which the songs are, though. I haven&#39;t even heard them yet. That&#39;s how it is working with Michael. It&#39;s a mystery.</span></p></body>
