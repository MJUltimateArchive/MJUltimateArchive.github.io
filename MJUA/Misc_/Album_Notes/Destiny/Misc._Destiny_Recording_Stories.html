He said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to do more arranging and here&rsquo;s who you&rsquo;re going to do it with.&rdquo; Next thing I know I&rsquo;m in a room with Michael and his brothers, and I ended up doing the rhythm section arrangement for [the Jackson 5&rsquo;s] </span><span class="cs43C038A">Destiny</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Triumph</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> albums.

There was a kinship, a mutual respect, but most of all, it was fun. One night after a session on the album, I talked most of the brothers into going to Magic Mountain, an amusement park outside of L.A. with me. No security guards, no cops, it was just us. But this was early, early on when they were making the transition from Motown to [CBS Records].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.keyboardmag.com/artists/greg-phillinganes-pop-musics-most-revered-session-and-touring-keyboardist-on-a-life-reflected-in-music"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Keyboard&rdquo; magazine (July 2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200210212206/https://www.keyboardmag.com/artists/greg-phillinganes-pop-musics-most-revered-session-and-touring-keyboardist-on-a-life-reflected-in-music"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Keyboard&rdquo;:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was Quincy your entry point into working with Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Phillinganes: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yes, but before Quincy started producing Michael&rsquo;s solo albums, a buddy of mine named Bobby Colomby called me one day and asked me, &ldquo;How do you feel about arranging?&rdquo; Now, even though I&rsquo;d done some, I was still a bit timid about my abilities. Bobby said to me, &ldquo;You should do more arranging.&rdquo; And I replied, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He then replied, &ldquo;Let me put it this way. You will do more arranging. And here&rsquo;s who you&rsquo;re going to do it with!&rdquo; The next thing I knew, I was in a room with the Jackson brothers, doing rhythm arrangements for the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Destiny</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album. The first song I worked on was &ldquo;Blame It on the Boogie.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael did something really sweet for me that I&rsquo;ll never forget. The running joke at that time was that I was a famous keyboard player but I didn&rsquo;t own a Rhodes of my own. After we finished the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Destiny</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album, I was at home minding my own business when my doorbell rang. A guy driving a white truck asked me, &ldquo;Are you Greg Phillinganes? I have something for you.&rdquo; He opened the truck and took out a giant case with a Rhodes Suitcase model in it. Attached was a note from Michael: &ldquo;I knew you didn&rsquo;t have one of these so I thought you&rsquo;d like one.&rdquo; I still have that Rhodes, and I recently had it completely redone. It sounds amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Black Music &amp; Jazz Review (April 1979)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The Jacksons own a twenty-four track studio attached to their home. It was in this studio that they cut the demos for the songs heard on &quot;Destiny&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That&#39;s how we got all those funky sounds on the album&quot;, says Marlon, prompting his brothers to break into a hand-slapping foot-stomping vamp. The vamp recalls up-for-the-down-stroke funk, not passooping disco.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When we record in our studio&quot;, says Jackie, &quot;We don&#39;t say going to cut a disco tune, we just cut. If the record comes out and is played in the disco, that&#39;s great, but we don&#39;t record disco, we record dancing music.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Billboard&rdquo; magazine (November 18, 1978)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;ve been writing all along&quot;, Tito points out, &quot;songs that we kept in our own personal bank. The first time we introduced our material to the public was when we went to CBS and did our first album. Then there were two on the second one, and now it&#39;s all of them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon adds, &quot;We had a lot of material, more than we could use on this album. We&#39;ll use that won the next one.&quot; And Jackie breaks in confidently, &quot;But we might do something to top that. We did on this album, just kept topping ourselves.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With five contributors to each song, the process could be a confusing one. Not so, claims Michael, &quot;It&#39;s much easier to write that way. Everybody has a different point of view, and something different to add.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Also, you have to have a certain mood&quot;, adds Tito. &quot;You can&#39;t just say &#39;I&#39;m going to write a song&#39;, and sit down and write it.&rsquo; So, say maybe Jackie and Marlon don&#39;t have their heads into what we&#39;re trying to get, so Michael and I, or Randy will work on it at first.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The same sense of five-way cooperation carries over to their production style. Marlon explains: &quot;When we were mixing the album, a lot of people thought each one of us would have a knob on the board. But we &nbsp;outslicked all of them. We&#39;d send maybe Tito and Michael in to mix it down, and the rest of us would sit out and wait until they&#39;d get the mix. Then fresh ears would come in and listen to it, because once you keep hearing the song over and over, you lose something. The next song, somebody else will mix it down.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The results, all agree, are solid. Michael is most assured in his assessment: &quot;I like it, and if I like it, I know they, the public, will. I keep up with the songs and the times. I feel we know what&#39;s happening.&quot;</span></p></body>
