But his brothers wanted him to prioritise The Jacksons&rsquo; next album, Destiny, the first the group were to write and produce as a whole. After years of disappointing sales it was a make or break album for the brothers, and Michael reluctantly agreed to put family ahead of his own solo ambitions.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mick Jackson, co-writer of &ldquo;Blame it on the Boogie&rdquo;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.disco-disco.com/artists/mick.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Discoguy&rdquo; interview (Summer 2003)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180626121830/http://www.disco-disco.com/artists/mick.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Discoguy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: When the Jacksons picked up the song - What did you think of that when you first heard about it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mick Jackson</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: &quot;I got such a rush - I was thrilled because their version was INCREDIBLE! Our version had 100% of our heart and soul in it but the Jackson&#39;s version had the magic extra 2% that made it incredible. We actually wrote it with Stevie Wonder in mind - now that would have been an INCREDIBLE version and to this day I think that would have been an amazing version...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Discoguy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Do you think the fact that you and the most famous of the Jackson brothers had the same name had something extra to do with them picking the song up (except for being a great track of course)?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mick: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;NO not at all - but the press LOVED that as an angle - in fact what happened was The Jackson&#39;s manager heard the track being played at the Midem Music Festival in 1978 and took a tape recording of it - he flew back to the states and The Jackson&#39;s quickly recorded a version so it would be out before mine. As it happened we both launched within days and that&#39;s how the &ldquo;Battle Of The Boogie&rdquo; started...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Discoguy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: ...In the charts the &ldquo;Battle of the Boogie&rdquo; broke out... What did you think about that? Wasn&#39;t it strange to hear your version played and then the Jackson&#39;s version of YOUR song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mick: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was pleased - it was great publicity - I also loved their version so I had the double pleasure of hearing both (versions) at the same time. There was an equal balance of interest from the media about both releases - A good example is that My version came out first on Top Of The Pops... The Jackson&#39;s had the second week. In the UK </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Radio 1</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> played The Jackson&#39;s version and Capitol radio only played mine - It was fair.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Discoguy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did many people think it was the other Michael who wrote the &quot;Blame it on the boogie&quot; track and that you were covering them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mick: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That was funny, there was a LOT of confusion... It was good fun though for us both I am sure. I had my limos going to his hotel and vice-versa... IN FACT - If you read the credits for the Jackson&#39;s album - DESTINY - they were very naughty... They wrote; ALL songs written by The Jackson&#39;s - which isn&#39;t true... BUT, I forgive them, as I am sure they wish they HAD written &#39;Blame it...&#39;. Haha!!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Discoguy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I&#39;m sure there were quite a few mix-up&#39;s with you and the other Michael, any special memories of some mix-up?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mick: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;People would call my hotel for him and that could be confusing, as we would chat for a minute before everyone realized. Cars would also be going to the other hotel for him/me - we always got the wrong cars arriving. A lot of flowers got sent to me as well, that was nice!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Discoguy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Have you ever met the &quot;other&quot; Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mick: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Yes several times, the first time was in a lift in the Montcalm Hotel in London and we just said Hi. Later at &ldquo;Top of the Pops&rdquo; TV show in London, England he asked me to sell him my Jumpsuit I was wearing for the show and I declined. He said &#39;Name your price&#39; and I still turned him down! The thing is with my big perm I KNEW I looked hot and wasn&#39;t prepared to let him in on the act. Haha! MJ was performing &#39;Destiny&#39; with his brothers that day.&quot;</span></p></body>
