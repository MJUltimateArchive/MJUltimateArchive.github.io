		<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Artie Wayne, writer of the song</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s summer of 1973 and Ed Silvers, President of Warner Brothers Music, is losing his patience with me. He thinks I&rsquo;m spending far too much time trying to get our songs cut at Motown. Although I secure songs in our catalog by some of their biggest artists, they&rsquo;re only album cuts. Ed is convinced that I&rsquo;ll never get a single released by Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I know at this point that the only way I could have a chance for a hit and escape the wrath of Ed, is to get a cover by the Jackson 5 or little Michael. There was only one staff writer at Warner Brothers music who could write in a classic R+B style, George S. Clinton, Jr.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I go to the two producers who love George&rsquo;s writing the most, Jerry Marcellino and Mel Larson, who just had big hits with 12 year old Michael on &ldquo;Rockin&rsquo; Robin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Little Bitty Pretty One&rdquo; (which was my suggestion). They tell me that &ldquo;Ben&rdquo;, from the movie of the same name, is racing up the charts and Berry Gordy wants each of his producers to start recording new sides with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I sit with Jerry and Mel and we talk about what kind of song they should record with Michael. I suggest a Christmas song, one so commercial that it could be the follow up single to, &ldquo;Ben&rdquo;. When I see their eyes light up, I tell them that George S. Clinton, Jr. and I have started such a song! When they ask to hear it, I tell them we were still working on it, when in fact we hadn&rsquo;t even started! I can&rsquo;t tell them the title, &rsquo;cause there isn&rsquo;t any! I do tell them, however, that it&rsquo;s a true story of how my girlfriend left me out in the cold like the last tree in a Christmas tree lot, which is left unsold on Christmas Eve. They freak out and say they had to have the finished song by Monday. I say, &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I call George, who knows nothing about any of this as soon as I get back to my office. He can&rsquo;t believe I told them we&rsquo;d have a finished song to them by Monday, when it&rsquo;s Friday and we haven&rsquo;t even started.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Saturday morning we meet at my office. It&rsquo;s the middle of summer, about 90 degrees, but we have to get in a Christmas Mood. As I tell George about my break up with Diana last Christmas, then I start to throw Ivory Snowflakes around the room. Soon, we have the first verse and chorus.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;Little Christmas Tree, looking sorta&rsquo; sad and lonely just like me</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">No one seems to care, they just went away and left him standing there&hellip;All alone on Christmas Eve!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Monday morning George does a piano voice demo, and I get it to Jerry and Mel that afternoon. They love it so much that they knock one of their own songs off the date and cut ours.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;m almost in tears when I hear the finished record the following week with the news that it&rsquo;s being considered for the follow-up to &ldquo;Ben&rdquo;, which had just hit number one! You can imagine how I feel a few weeks later when Berry Gordy, Jr. decides not put out any follow up to the Oscar nominated &ldquo;Ben&rdquo;, until the Academy Awards are given out&hellip;which is after Christmas! A few days later I come up with a plan and present it to Motown. I suggest that the company puts a double albums worth of previously recorded Christmas songs by each of their hit artists, along with &ldquo;Little Christmas Tree&rdquo;. The double album is called &ldquo;A Motown Christmas&rdquo;, which includes cuts by Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Diana Ross, and it&rsquo;s released just in time for the holidays.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">—————————————————</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It isn&rsquo;t very often that I&rsquo;m shocked at the passing of one of our musical heroes, but when I heard about Michael Jackson I was devastated. I&rsquo;ve known Michael since he was 12 years old and he recorded a song I co-wrote, &ldquo;Little Christmas Tree&rdquo; (Clinton/Wayne)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met him and his family at the Tokyo Music Festival in 1974, and had a chance to tell him how much I liked his recording of my song. I also told him that he was one of my biggest dance influences, which made him smile considering I was three times his age.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I told Michael that I was a songplugger and I couldn&rsquo;t go out dancing late at night like I once did, he said in that high little voice of his, &ldquo;Artie&hellip;why don&rsquo;t you build a dance floor in your office?&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As soon as I got back to Hollywood, Warner Brothers Music built me a four foot circular plywood dance floor, but a few months later when I went to run A&amp;Ms publishing company they constructed a six foot mahogany one for me! To this day I&rsquo;m proud to tell everyone that it was Michael Jackson&rsquo;s idea.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The last time I was in touch with him was when he was about to do the &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; album. He was holding onto one of my songs for over a year, and even made a few suggestions to improve the bridge, but in the end he didn&rsquo;t record it. I was still grateful for the opportunity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From now until the end of time millions of words will be written about him and his influence in music, dance, and fashion, but the most important gift he has given the world is everlasting hope and inspiration.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
