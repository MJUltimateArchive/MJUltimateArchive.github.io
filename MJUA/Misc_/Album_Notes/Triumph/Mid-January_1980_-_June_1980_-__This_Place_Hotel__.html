Further evidenced by the fact that, according to studio engineer Tom Perry, the &ldquo;Triumph&rdquo; album was a &ldquo;six month period&rdquo;, and that they finished the music of all tracks before starting vocals; the recording was likely to be the latter six months of the sessions (sessions began in late June 1979) after the January 13, 1980 concert on their &ldquo;Destiny World Tour&rdquo;. &ldquo;We would start to do some guitar, keyboard, and synth overdubs. Then, we would go onto the next song. Generally, we would work on one song per day working on rhythm tracks and we wouldn&rsquo;t get into recording any serious vocals, background vocals, strings, or horns until later.&rdquo; (<a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs149B5A36">&ldquo;Wax Poetics&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">) (<a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613225302/www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs149B5A36">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &ldquo;Moonwalk&rdquo; autobiography (1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was one exception [to the weaker tracks on the &ldquo;Triumph album]: &ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel.&rdquo; I swear that was a phrase that came out of my head and I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of any other song when I wrote it. The record company printed it on the cover as &ldquo;This Place Hotel,&rdquo; because of the Elvis Presley connection. As important as he was to music, black as well as white, he just wasn&rsquo;t an influence on me. I guess he was too early for me. Maybe it was timing more than anything else. By the time our song had come out, people thought that if I kept living in seclusion the way I was, I might die the way he did. The parallels aren&rsquo;t there as far as I&rsquo;m concerned and I was never much for scare tactics. Still, the way Elvis destroyed himself interests me, because I don&rsquo;t ever want to walk those grounds myself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LaToya was asked to contribute the scream that opens the song&mdash;not the most auspicious start to a recording career, I&rsquo;ll admit, but she was just getting her feet wet in the studio. She has made some good records since and is quite accomplished. The scream was the kind that normally shatters a bad dream, but our intention was to have the dream only begin, to make the listener wonder whether it was a dream or reality. That was the effect I think we got. The three female backup singers were amused when they were doing the scary backup effects that I wanted, until they actually heard them in the mix.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rdquo; was the most ambitious song I had composed. I think I worked on a number of levels: You could dance to it, sing along with it, get scared by it, and just listen. I had to tack on a slow piano and cello coda that ended on a positive note to reassure the listener; there&rsquo;s no point in trying to scare someone if there isn&rsquo;t something to bring the person back safe and sound from where you&rsquo;ve taken them. &ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rdquo; had revenge in it and I am fascinated by the concept of revenge. It&rsquo;s something I can&rsquo;t understand. The idea of making someone &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for something they&rsquo;ve done to you or that you imagine they&rsquo;ve done to you is totally alien to me. The setup showed my own fears and for the time being helped quell them. There were so many sharks in this business looking for blood in the water.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If this song, and later &ldquo;Billie Jean,&rdquo; seemed to cast women in an unfavorable light, it was not meant to be taken as a personal statement. Needless to say, I love the interaction between the sexes; it is a natural part of life and I love women. I just think that when sex is used as a form of blackmail or power, it&rsquo;s a repugnant use of one of God&rsquo;s gifts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Tom Perry, engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs8567212B">Wax Poetics interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I thought &ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rdquo; [&ldquo;This Place Hotel&rdquo;] was a phenomenal song. It should&rsquo;ve been a bigger hit than it was. It may have been a little bit ahead of its time. I thought the song was really creative and interesting. It was a great, great record. It was a composition written by Michael. It had the same title as the Elvis Presley hit from the 1950s. The song had a great groove. The lead vocals and harmonies from Michael were spectacular. He did all the harmonies. He sung every part including the backgrounds and his brothers voices were used as depth on the record. I&rsquo;m still amazed by his vocals on it from his low to high harmonies. We would double each harmony. We had enough tracks to do that. If he sung a third, fifth, or seventh, we&rsquo;d double or triple them to make them sound fuller. In my opinion, this was the standout track from the album. It&rsquo;s one of the better mixes on the album. The horn arrangement by Jerry Hey was just outstanding work. Latoya screaming on the record was one of the ideas Michael pulled out of his hat. He heard it in his head, and he called her to come down to the studio to record it. He&rsquo;d hear something in his head and just make it happen. I couldn&rsquo;t have made it through without my assistant engineer Ross Palone. On every song, we gave them everything we had.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;Sometimes, you have an inkling that you&rsquo;re onto something, and that feeling was there when we made &ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rdquo; [&ldquo;This Place Hotel&rdquo;].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nightmarish opening scream courtesy of Michael&rsquo;s sister, La Toya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Promo footage, of the Jacksons dancing around a swimming pool, remains unreleased.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Re-titled &lsquo;This Place Hotel&rsquo; on later releases, to avoid any confusion with the Elvis Presley classic with the same title (this didn&rsquo;t stop Whitney Houston from recording yet another song titled &lsquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rsquo; in 1998, and turning it into a smash hit).</span></p></body>
