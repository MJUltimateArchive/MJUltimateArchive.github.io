Further evidenced by the fact that, according to studio engineer Tom Perry, the &ldquo;Triumph&rdquo; album was a &ldquo;six month period&rdquo;, and that they finished the music of all tracks before starting vocals; the recording was likely to be the latter six months of the sessions (sessions began in late June 1979) after the January 13, 1980 concert on their &ldquo;Destiny World Tour&rdquo;. &ldquo;We would start to do some guitar, keyboard, and synth overdubs. Then, we would go onto the next song. Generally, we would work on one song per day working on rhythm tracks and we wouldn&rsquo;t get into recording any serious vocals, background vocals, strings, or horns until later.&rdquo; (<a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs149B5A36">&ldquo;Wax Poetics&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">) (<a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613225302/www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs149B5A36">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bill Wolfer, keyboardist, &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; magazine (November 2014) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190805083253/http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first time I met Michael and his brothers was when they were recording the Triumph album. My friend Ronnie Foster had been called to do some keyboard parts, and he asked them to include me to program the synthesizers. They must have noticed that I could play as well as program, and the next week they called me in to play overdubs on &ldquo;Can You Feel It&rdquo;. Michael wanted an effect that fades in and builds to a crescendo, sounding almost as if it were played backwards. It makes its first appearance at 3:14 on the song. It was done on a Yamaha CS-80, a massive 220 pound beast of a synthesizer. For some reason, I wasn&rsquo;t listed on the credits when the album appeared, but that is me on there!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Tom Perry, engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs8567212B">Wax Poetics interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Can You Feel It&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t one of my favorite songs, but it became a big hit. I know the video received a lot of play on MTV when it was just starting out as a network. Michael was the driving force behind this song. We spent </span><span class="cs43C038A">a lot</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> of time on this song. We brought in two different choirs to sing. During the mixing process of this song, I wish I would&rsquo;ve put a little bit more low end in the drums. I thought it was too sharp sounding overall. I think we worked the longest on this song and &ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rdquo; [&ldquo;This Place Hotel&rdquo;]. If I had to do it again, I would&rsquo;ve put more warmth in that mix. Typically, it would take four or five days to complete the final mix of the songs. Sometimes you work on something so long that you lose any kind of perspective and you don&rsquo;t know what to do next. I think &ldquo;Can You Feel It&rdquo; was a little overworked. It ended up being a classic song, though.</span></p></body>
