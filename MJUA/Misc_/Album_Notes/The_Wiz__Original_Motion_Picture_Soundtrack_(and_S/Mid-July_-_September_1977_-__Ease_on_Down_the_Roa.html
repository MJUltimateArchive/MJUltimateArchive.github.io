His name is Michael Jackson.&rsquo; But that didn&rsquo;t prepare me for the Michael Jackson I met.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;By this time, Michael was around 20 years old. When Swedien met him, Michael &ldquo; &hellip; was very shy, very quiet.&rdquo; Jackson let his artistry speak for itself, and Swedien was floored by it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He came in and recorded &lsquo;Ease On Down the Road&rsquo; with no lyrics in front of him,&rdquo; says Swedien. &ldquo;And I thought to myself, &lsquo;Holy cow!&rsquo; Here&rsquo;s someone heavy-duty all right. And from that point on, every recording, every major record that I did with Michael, he never had the lyrics in front of him. He would stay up the night before all night and memorize the lyrics, and the reason he did that was he loved to sing with the lights out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&ldquo;Charlie Smalls wrote most of the music [for &ldquo;The Wiz&rdquo;],&rdquo; says Swedien. &ldquo;Quincy revamped it all once we got into the recording process and orchestrated it and everything, but the songs were really strong. &lsquo;Ease On Down The Road&rsquo; &hellip; that&rsquo;s a pretty powerful piece of R&amp;B music, and it just fit Michael to a T.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;The Wiz&rdquo; Soundtrack:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/michael-jackson-the-making-of-a-king-part-2"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Goldmine&rdquo; magazine (April 9, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013124/https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/michael-jackson-the-making-of-a-king-part-2"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What many don&rsquo;t know is that Jones was severely under the gun to finish all the arrangements before recording began. To hear Swedien tell it, Jones had everything under control.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was a Sunday, and we were set to record the opening and closing titles the next day, Monday, with a huge orchestra, an 80-piece orchestra at A&amp;R studios in New York,&rdquo; says Swedien. &lsquo;And Quincy and I were living together at the Drake Hotel as 65th and Park in New York, and I noticed Quincy hadn&rsquo;t written anything, hadn&rsquo;t put a note to a piece of paper. And then, in the afternoon, on that Sunday before we were set to record, he invited a bunch of our pals over for dinner.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Understandably, Swedien was concerned his friend wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to pull it off, even though he knew Quincy worked well under pressure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;So we had our dinner and everything, and I said, &lsquo;Quincy, you know what we&rsquo;re doing tomorrow. You haven&rsquo;t even put a note on paper yet for the big 80-piece orchestra,&rsquo;&rdquo; continues Swedien. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;No problem. Don&rsquo;t worry about a thing.&rsquo; So we went to bed. I went to bed anyway. About four in the morning, I woke up for a minute and looked under my hotel room door, and the lights were blazing. We had a big apartment at the Drake. And the dining room table was covered with sheet music, with music paper. And the pages were black with notes. It looked like flies had been shitting on them all day. And so I tippy-toed out and asked Quincy how&rsquo;s it going, and he said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about a thing. Ain&rsquo;t no problem. Ain&rsquo;t nothing but a move.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And move he did, getting it all done under the wire. The next morning, Jones and Swedien headed for the studio in a cab. Under his arm, Jones carried a bunch of music paper.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We had this army of copyists just waiting for us, and they had tables around the edge of the studio, and they had these copyists copying the parts for the musicians,&rdquo; says Swedien. &ldquo;And the session was due to start at 1 in the afternoon. And at 10 o&rsquo;clock, Quincy and I arrived, and he started handing out this paper that was just covered with notes and I said, &lsquo;Quincy, how are you doing?&rsquo; And he just smiled. Didn&rsquo;t say a word. Just smiled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the orchestra is assembled. The copyists finish their work, and the parts are passed out to the musicians &mdash; &ldquo;Big strings,&rdquo; says Swedien. &ldquo;I think it was 16 violins, eight violas, eight or 10 cello basses, brass, woodwinds &hellip; everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tension in the room was thick. Nobody spoke a word.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You could have heard a pin drop in that studio,&rdquo; says Swedien. &ldquo;Quincy had not heard a note &mdash; incidentally, I should explain, too, in our dining room in the apartment, there wasn&rsquo;t one musical instrument. No piano, no guitar, no nothing. The only musical instrument was between Quincy&rsquo;s ears. And so, the conductor raised his baton, they played through the thing and this gorgeous, dream-like sound filled the studio and there was not one note out of place. Is that incredible? Quincy had looked at me and smiled, &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t too bad, is it?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;Jones had done his job, and now it was time for Swedien to do his.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And what I did on &lsquo;The Wiz&rsquo; was, I built a sound truck that we took all over New York because we filmed on location in New York, and I had to play back that music while the cameras shot it, and boy that was fun,&rdquo; says Swedien. &ldquo;And we had restrictions in New York. You can&rsquo;t have more than 23-foot axle limit on a truck, so I had to jam a whole recording studio into a truck that we could drive through the streets. That was tough. But it worked. We did it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/bruce-swedien-recording-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Sound on Sound&rdquo; (November 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330005847/https://www.soundonsound.com/people/bruce-swedien-recording-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Quincy and I first worked together with Michael Jackson on the movie The Wiz. We were living together at a hotel in Manhattan, and we would go to Studio A at A&amp;R Studios. We had a big session at noon on Monday to record some of the music with a big 70</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> or 80</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">piece orchestra, and we had to leave for the studio at 10am. The night before, Quincy and I had guests at our hotel for dinner, and Quincy still hadn&#39;t even started on the orchestration for the opening titles. I was getting a little nervous, but he said not to worry about it. At about four that morning, I woke up and noticed under my door that all the lights in the apartment were blazing. There&#39;s Quincy at the dining</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">room table with a billion sheets of manuscript paper, and he was writing orchestrations. I said &#39;Quincy, we&#39;ve got to leave soon!&#39;, but he just said &#39;Don&#39;t worry about it&#39; so I went back to bed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;At about nine o&#39;clock I got up again, and Quincy said to me &#39;I&#39;m all set&#39;. There wasn&#39;t even a piano or a guitar in the apartment; just Quincy and his manuscript paper! Off we go to the studio, and Quincy hands over his score to the copyists. He didn&#39;t even want to conduct &mdash; he&#39;d hired a conductor because he wanted to be in the control room with me. The conductor gave the down beat, the orchestra played the entire overture, and there was not a single note out of place. It still gives me the chills to think about it!&rdquo;</span></p></body>
