He was 21 years old and he said he wanted to write songs with me. We spent many weeks together in my studio writing, preparing for the album, but unfortunately we never got to do the project.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Recently this man died very tragically. They went to his home and they found this song in his drawer and they thought it was a new song and they got very excited and released it as part of a film. But they found out very quickly it was not a new song but one that I wrote with him many years ago. We didn&#39;t have any legal problems because in respect of him, I wanted things to be smooth, so I gave them permission to go ahead with the song that we wrote together. His name was Michael Jackson and this is it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/paul-ankas-newest-single-features-duet-with-michael-jackson/article18892638/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Globe and Mail&rdquo; (May 28, 2014)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190226154622/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/paul-ankas-newest-single-features-duet-with-michael-jackson/article18892638/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve had a long journey with that song,&quot; Anka told The Globe last week. &quot;It&#39;s certainly a commentary on good material. It&#39;s from a period where Michael was really in his zone.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;His genius was that he had a very strong and passionate love for what he was doing and knowing himself. You could put a drum and a piano and maybe a bass with all those sounds he makes and his whole wherewithal with himself, and what he was capable of doing was remarkable.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;He was very unusual in the way he approached a song,&quot; Anka said of the King of Pop. &quot;I&#39;d have to sell him on some chords, and convince him that it could be different or better. Then, once he got in the loop with me, he contributed, but not in an aggressive way. He was a very mild-mannered and shy human being.&quot;</span></p></body>
