Since he &ldquo;continued work on the track at Hayvenhurst&rdquo; (&ldquo;Xscape&rdquo; album liner notes), it can be surmised that it was recorded in early 1985. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Xscape&rdquo; album liner notes</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A breezy, mid-tempo groove, &ldquo;Loving You&rdquo; was written and produced by Jackson and originally recorded at Red Wing Studio in the San Fernando Valley during the early </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> sessions. &ldquo;Sometimes he got a song idea, and he just wanted to test it out before going to Westlake,&rdquo; recalls Jackson&rsquo;s longtime recording engineer, Matt Forger. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d sneak away to these smaller studios and it would just be a place where he could work and experiment and add different layers.&rdquo; After his home studio was renovated, Jackson continued work on the track at Hayvenhurst. With its charming Motown-like vibe and effortless vocal, the song takes the listener back to an earlier era, offering another gem from one of the most prolific periods in Jackson&rsquo;s career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
