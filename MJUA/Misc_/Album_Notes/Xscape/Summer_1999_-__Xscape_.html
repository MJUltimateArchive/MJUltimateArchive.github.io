It&rsquo;s kind of a prophetic song. Listen to the bridge. MJ says, &lsquo;When I go, this world won&rsquo;t bother me no more.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s powerful.&rdquo; In another verse, Jackson sings of escaping from the surveillance of &ldquo;electric eyes.&rdquo; Jerkins first presented an early demo without lyrics to Jackson in 1999 over the phone. The pair continued to work on the track up until the release of Invincible (and even a little bit after). When Jerkins came in the studio to update the song over a decade later, he says, &ldquo;it was really important for me to kind of like zone out and think as if Michael was sitting right next to me&mdash;what he would be telling me and what I would be telling him. I knew that the times have changed sonically. I would&rsquo;ve been saying to Michael, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s 808s now, the 808s are prevalent now, we gotta make sure they&rsquo;re in it.&rsquo; And I know Michael would say, &ldquo;but make sure it stays funky. It&rsquo;s gotta be funky.&rdquo; And I would tell Michael live horns and live strings are a feel-good element again in music today and the rhythm guitars. Michael loved guitars&hellip;When I was working on it&mdash;it sounds insane&mdash;but I was really trying to make sure I was kind of communicating with MJ, what I felt MJ would be telling me if he was right there working with me.&rdquo; Of the final result, Jerkins says, &ldquo;When I listen to it, I&rsquo;m proud. It feels like what we did yesterday, it feels like what we would do today, and it feels like it could still work tomorrow. That was always the goal with us.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
