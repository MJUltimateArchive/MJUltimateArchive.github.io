They wanted to find songs [for the &ldquo;Xscape&rdquo; album], says Reid, that &quot;Michael sang beginning to end multiple times, multiple tracks, because that was the only indication that I could find that spoke to Michael&#39;s love to the songs.&quot; Reid knew this well &mdash; when he and Edmonds recorded the original &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; with Jackson in Los Angeles in 1989, during the Dangerous sessions, Jackson recorded the vocal 24 times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And it was not once and fix the bad note,&quot; says Reid. &quot;No, he sang the song from top to bottom 24 times without a bathroom break, without a water break, without a &#39;Give me a moment.&#39; He would sing the song and say, &#39;OK, give me another track, I can do it better,&#39; and he&#39;d do it again. &#39;I can nail this. Give me another track,&#39; and he&#39;d do it again. Each time he&#39;s getting better and better, but by the time you got to track 13, 14 we got lost, because it all started to sound the same. At that point he&#39;d perfected it, but he just kept going.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The version leaked at the end of 2010 was one finished by Tricky Stewart with brand new instrumentation after he had been called in by the estate of Michael Jackson.
