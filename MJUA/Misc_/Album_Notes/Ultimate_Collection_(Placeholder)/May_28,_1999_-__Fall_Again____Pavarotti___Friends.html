It was co-written and produced with Walter Afanasieff. What many people don&#39;t know is that I wrote my song as a reaction to and after having been inspired by a song that Walter and Alan Thicke wrote for Michael back in &#39;99 called &#39;Fall Again&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The story goes like this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I was recording the Savage Garden album &#39;Affirmation&#39; with Walter in 1999 at his studio in San Francisco, he played me a demo of the song &#39;Fall Again&#39; which at that time had Robin Thicke&#39;s vocals on it. Walter and Robin had intended to submit the song to M.J for his &#39;Invincible&#39; album project.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was completely in awe and all I could hear was Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the time, Walter told me he wasn&#39;t sure if Michael would be interested but as a fan I had a feeling that when M.J heard it he&#39;d respond like I had. It reminded me of the lushness of classic Michael songs like &#39;Human Nature&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I knew M.J would kill it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sure enough, the song got to Michael and he loved it and agreed to cut a demo of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Slight hitch? The only time M.J had available was when Walter was booked in with me to finish the vocals for the Savage Garden album &#39;Affirmation&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Walter decided he could record both sessions and so we flew to New York and</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I recorded in the mornings with Walter at Sony Studios and he then left in the afternoon to record Michael Jackson at The Hit Factory in the afternoon literally across</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the street.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The version in this post is the one and only time Michael ever sang the song. One take. He hadn&#39;t even had a chance to learn the song properly (and what an amazing job he did!).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The day he recorded Michael Walter came back to my session at Sony Studios about 2 hours later beaming. He spoke in glowing terms about Michael, about his voice, about his politeness and talent. And what touched me the most was he told me that Michael&#39;s children (Prince and Paris) were at the session and M.J had set up a t.v monitor in his recording booth so he could see the children playing with the Nanny in another room while he was singing. The session was cut short because the children were poorly and Michael wanted to be a good Dad and tend to them. He apparently apologised and left the session after only one take.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I never heard Michael&#39;s version until it was released many years later (even though Walter knew I was a massive fan he respected M.J&#39;s privacy and never played it to me). But I had remembered the feeling and the magic of the song from the first time I heard Robin Thicke&#39;s vocal and so when it came time for me to record my first solo album, I asked Walter to try and write a song with the same energy with me. That&#39;s how we wrote &#39;Insatiable&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s amazing to hear Michael&#39;s demo version of &#39;Fall Again&#39; so many years later and be in awe of his artistry. Michael is the reason I became a performer (having seen his &#39;Bad&#39; tour in 1987 and knowing in an instant that performing was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life). Listening to his records taught me how to sing. I&#39;m proud that years later in my own career there are pieces of him in my work. And although he is not with us anymore, I like to think that little spark he ignited in me as an artist is part of his legacy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sorry if this was long and sappy - but I know there are M.J fans out there who would appreciate this story. I&#39;d always wanted to tell it. And today I did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Pavarotti &amp; Friends for Guatemala and Kosovo&rdquo; Performance Cancellation:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan Morrish, &ldquo;New York Post&rdquo; (June 2, 1999) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.angelfire.com/mi/michaelradio/news99b.html"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190806131009/http://www.angelfire.com/mi/michaelradio/news99b.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Prince suffered a serious seizure very early on Saturday due to a high temperature due to a viral illness.
