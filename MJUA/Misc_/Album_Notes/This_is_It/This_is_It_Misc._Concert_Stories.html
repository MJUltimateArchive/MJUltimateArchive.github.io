And &quot;You&#39;re what we&#39;re looking for. Come in, learn &#39;Beat It&#39;, &#39;Dirty Diana&#39;, &#39;Wanna Be Startin&#39; Something&#39;.&quot; Next morning, go and play for him, [hide our soul] and we just started rehearsing. &#39;Cause I didn&#39;t tell anybody, &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t, &#39;cause we signed these forms. And it was just four months of craziness. And then, so when he passed, it was such a shock, and then that clip started running, and I couldn&#39;t turn on the TV without it being on it... It definitely was, kind of a strange moment in my life, and then going out and then putting out my album, and that happening, having that moment to just--for it to sink in, you know? So that was kind of a crazy time. But, honestly, I feel very blessed that I got to spend that time with him, for sure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trunks: Did you get to work directly with him alot?... Or was he very hands-on in the things you were looking for?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Orianthi: He was hands-on with everybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trunks: He was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Orianthi: Yeah, absolutely. With the dancers, and he would spend time with me, my sound, how he wanted it, how he wanted me to walk over to him and be very mobile. So, playing the &quot;Beat It&quot; solo, I couldn&#39;t even look at my guitar, I had to follow him &#39;cause he was like running across the stage and he&#39;s like that, &quot;Run over here, run over here&quot;. I&#39;m, like, in heels, [and I go &quot;OK&quot;]. So, that was interesting, but the whole thing was such a show, and [maybe] a better showperson. So yeah, I guess he really brought out the best in everybody and that was the great thing about working with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Orianthi: His dancing, so precise, and he--the first song we played was &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.... Jonathan Moffett goes into that beat, which is perfect, right? And then Michael comes over to me and he just starts dancing in front of me. I&#39;m going, &quot;Is this reality?&quot;. It&#39;s weird. I&#39;m like, &quot;Ok, this is just a normal day for me&quot;. So that was crazy, but yeah, he was wonderful to work with. I mean, seriously. It would have been an incredible show. And he&#39;s really funny too. Alot of people don&#39;t know that he was actually really funny too. We had a lot of funny moments, like he would get stuck in different things. Especially this huge tarantula that came out at the beginning of Thriller, and it was controlled by him, so he was in the tarantula covered in Swarovski crystals. It was very extravagant. So this thing comes out, and he couldn&#39;t get out... So the intro to Thriller goes on for 3 minutes and he&#39;s not coming out, and everyone&#39;s going, &quot;Maybe he just wants to make it longer&quot;, and he&#39;s like, &quot;Hi guys, I&#39;m kind of stuck in here. Can someone help me?&quot; That was really funny, I couldn&#39;t stop laughing.</span></p></body>
