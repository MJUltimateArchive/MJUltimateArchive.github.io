Jackson was arrested, charged, and was awaiting trial at the time (at which he would later be found not guilty on all counts).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After previously writing a song about being a &ldquo;loser,&rdquo; Jackson and Buxer began talking about things that made them happy and lifted their spirits when feeling down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael recalled that when he was in The Jackson Five he visited a beautiful place in England called Gloucestershire. Jackson, however, took creative license (as he often did) on the pronunciation of the South West county &ndash; pronouncing it as it reads, not as it really should be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to Jackson, the time he spent in Gloucestershire as a teenager three decades earlier while on tour with his brothers was still one of his fondest memories. And so, just like they did with &ldquo;Loser,&rdquo; Jackson and Buxer turned life into art.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the song Jackson sings: &ldquo;I wish that we&rsquo;ll see Gloucestershire. I wish that we&rsquo;ll see Gloucestershire, again,&rdquo; but he is not singing that he misses the place. Rather, it&rsquo;s an analogy for happy times. He is singing that he wishes he and his female companion would see happy times again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buxer did the music and Jackson wrote the lyrics, then Brad left to go home for a few days. Prince stayed at the ranch with Jackson and went on to record all the King of Pop&rsquo;s vocals in a makeshift studio right there in the bungalow&rsquo;s bathroom &ndash; not an uncommon thing for Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, unfortunately &ndash; as with the vast majority of material he was working on during the final years of his life &ndash; Jackson never got to bring the track to completion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As it stands in its final version, the song has just one verse and a chorus which Jackson sings over and over again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He would do is go in and do the first verse, and the chorus, and he would not do a second verse,&rdquo; says Teddy Riley of Jackson&rsquo;s habits when writing or recording demos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just to get the idea down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is the way Jackson worked in order to decipher which tracks he felt good about, and which he didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What I do when I write is that I&rsquo;ll do a raggedy, rough version just to hear the chorus, just to see how much I like the chorus,&rdquo; explained Jackson. &ldquo;If it works for me that way when it&rsquo;s raggedy, then I&rsquo;ll know it will just work &hellip; I do that same process with every song. It&rsquo;s the melody. It&rsquo;s the melody that&rsquo;s most important. If the melody can sell me then I&rsquo;ll go to the next step.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Days In Gloucestershire&rdquo; is by no means complete, but judging by the positive reaction from Jackson&rsquo;s loyal fans since it first appeared online yesterday, and to those who are simply looking at it as a piece of art, that lack of completion doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter one bit.</span></p></body>
