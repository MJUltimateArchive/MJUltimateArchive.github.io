It was already mixed from that era. It&#39;s a mid-tempo, melancholy, rainy-day-by-the-fireplace kind of song. It&#39;s a bit reminiscent of Stevie Wonder&mdash;the harmonica, the tonality. Stevie was a big part of Michael&#39;s life. It&#39;s not unusual that you would see that influence in his work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://mjdatabank.com/mjjnews/wordpress/2012/06/01/exclusive-dont-be-messin-round-a-review-en/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MJ Data Bank&rdquo; (October 9, 2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120803164704/http://mjdatabank.com/mjjnews/wordpress/2012/06/01/exclusive-dont-be-messin-round-a-review-en/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The bridge section of the song has this great harmonica solo, or actually an instrument that sounds like a harmonica: &ldquo;That was in fact a synthesizer harmonica&rdquo;, reveals Forger. &ldquo;And that was actually John Barnes. He is a very talented keyboard musician. And he could play many instruments like horns and brasses. So he could understand how a musician who plays the actual instrument and how the notes had to be attacked and that is one of the things he was very versatile and very talented at&rdquo;.</span></p></body>
