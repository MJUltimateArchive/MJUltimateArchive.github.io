Billie Jean is kinda anonymous. It represents a lot of girls who used to - they used to call them groupies in the &#39;60s - they would hang around backstage doors and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with. And I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to my brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110647/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/musician1984.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Musician&rdquo; magazine (July 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Part of the rhythm was recorded on 16-tracks&quot;, says Swedien. &quot;THat way I don&#39;t use any noise reduction equipment and the quality is fabulous. It gives it more punch. You can hear it in the drum sound.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jerry Hey arranged the strings that heightened the tension on &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. &quot;If you listen to the strings only, you&#39;ll swear you&#39;re in the Carnegie Hall&quot;, claims Swedien. &quot;It has a very natural stereo spread. The recording of it as a legitimate and straight-forward as a classical recording.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Way in the back of the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; mix is Tom Scott playing an (uncredited) Lyricon solo. &quot;It was Quincy&#39;s idea to weave this little thread into the thing&quot;, says Swedien. &quot;It was a last minute overdub thing. Quincy calls it &#39;ear candy&#39;. You&#39;re not conscious of it. It&#39;s just a subliminal element that works well.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another tactic employed by &quot;Thriller&quot;&#39;s brain trust was for Michael to sing parts of the backing vocal through a mail tube. But on the lead vocal, though it&#39;s difficult to believe, Michael gave a letter-perfect reading the first time. Swedien says, &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one punch on that lead vocal. I&#39;m serious.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/bruce-swedien-recording-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Sound on Sound&rdquo; (November 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330005847/https://www.soundonsound.com/people/bruce-swedien-recording-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The special effect on the &#39;Don&#39;t think twice!&#39; interjection in verse two of &#39;Billie Jean&#39;, for instance, was created by singing through a five</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">foot long cardboard tube. The drums on the same track are no machine, as is often assumed, but a single live drum take recorded with extreme separation: the hat was isolated from the snare using a purpose</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">built foot</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">square wood and mu</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">metal panel, and the kick was recorded using another piece of bespoke baffling. &quot;It was the first time I took the kick drum apart,&rdquo; remembers Swedien. &quot;I took the front head off, put a special cinderblock in it for weight, and then had this cover made out of furniture blanket with a zippered hole for the mic to go through.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &#39;Billie Jean&#39; drum sound, like that on many of Swedien&#39;s records, also relied on a purpose</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">built drum riser the engineer originally had constructed for recording the previous album&#39;s &#39;Rock With You&#39;: a braced, eight</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">foot-square wooden platform raised 10 inches off the ground. &quot;The reason I wanted the drums to be up off the floor,&rdquo; he wrote in his autobiography, Make Mine Music, &quot;is to keep the low</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">frequency drum sounds (such as the bass drum and tom</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">toms) from coupling with the surface of the floor and entering the sound pickup area of the microphones on the other instruments in the session. This secondary pickup of the low</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">frequency end of the drum kit can travel through walls! By putting the drum setup on my drum platform, those low sounds never had the chance of connecting with the floor and creating off</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">mic, obscure, second</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">hand pickup.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I did 91 mixes of &#39;Billie Jean&#39;, and finally Quincy said &#39;Let&#39;s go back and listen to mix number two.&#39; And we did, and it blew us all away! I had overmixed that song right into the pooper, so the mix that went onto the record was mix number two.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;...I always try to put some element of stark reality into my productions, a little patch of blue sky. I&#39;ll give you an example. There&#39;s a string line in &#39;Billie Jean&#39;, and I recorded that absolutely classically in Studio A at Westlake, with violins left, violas slightly to the right, and celli to the right. If you listen to that song it just jumps right out at you. It&#39;s so natural and so basic it&#39;s just pathetic, but it adds so much to that mix.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ndugu Chancler, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110647/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/musician1984.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Musician&rdquo; magazine (July 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael always knew hoe he wanted the song to sound&quot;, remembers Chancler. &quot;I was placed in a room by myself, so there was no leakage. Both Michael and Quincy came in to suggest things for the two or three hours it took to cut the track. I played through it about eight to ten times.&quot; Chancler credits Swedien for creating the balance between his nine-piece jacaranda wood drum set and the drum machine that is the foundation of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Louis Johnson, bassist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110647/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/musician1984.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Musician&rdquo; magazine (July 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael was very specific about how he wanted the bassline to go&quot;, says Louis Johnson, member of the Brothers Johnson. &quot;He had me bring all my guitars to see how they sounded playing that part. I tried three or four basses before we settled on the Yamaha. It&#39;s really live, with a lot of power and guts. If you&#39;d have heard me on a different bass on &#39;Billie Jean&#39;, you&#39;d have said, &#39;Use the Yamaha.&#39; On the basic riff, I overdubbed three parts to strengthen its power.&quot; Phillinganes later doubled the bassline on &quot;Billie Jean&quot; (and on most of &quot;Thriller&quot;&#39;s other tracks) with a synthesizer bass.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bill Wolfer, keyboardist, &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; magazine (November 2014) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190805083253/http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is the most famous track, but that keyboard part, those three chords, that sound, has got to be the most iconic keyboard part in recent history. I say that in all humility, because anyone could have played it, it&rsquo;s certainly not technically demanding. And because that song was so successful, practically everyone on the Planet Earth has heard me play! It&rsquo;s strange to think about in that way, but true. I am proud of the sound that I programmed. Anyone could have played the part, but the reason Michael called me was that he had heard me fooling around with that sound when we were on tour, and he remembered it, and made a note of it in his mind for use in Billie Jean. The sound is a Yamaha CS-80 again. It is definitely my favorite synthesizer&ndash;I still have one. No, it&rsquo;s not the one used on the record, that was a rental.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;&rdquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; started out at Michael&rsquo;s house in Encino. He had turned the guest house into a 16 track studio, and we made demos there of the three songs that I eventually recorded with Quincy for the album. Michael and I started by sitting down at a Rhodes piano, and Michael sang me the bass line. I started playing it, and then he sang the top notes of the three chords that ascend and descend over that ostinato bass. At that point, we spent maybe an hour or more trying out different harmonies for the rest of the chords. There are a million ways you can harmonize those notes, and I tried them all before I landed on the one he was looking for. The amazing part about that is that, to me, several of the combinations I tried sounded very hip to me&ndash;they worked, but Michael never lost sight of what he had been hearing in his head. He didn&rsquo;t play an instrument, but he was definitely a musician. He could work out entire arrangements in his head, and hang onto them, even when he was hearing something very close.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next step was recreating the sound Michael had heard me experimenting with sometime during the tour. I didn&rsquo;t even remember it at first. There was a CS-80 there, and eventually I remembered a sound where I was trying to get something like French horns and strings simultaneously, but this other weird aspect, almost like human voices crept in. Once I had the sound programmed, we recorded the demo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I will always remember the day I recorded that part at Westlake Studios. Michael and Quincy were working on a deadline for a children&rsquo;s album about E.T. the Extraterrestrial in Studio A. Michael showed me to Studio B, where a CS-80 was set up. He said, &ldquo;You know the part, go ahead and record it, and I&rsquo;ll come listen later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So it was just me and the second engineer Matt. After I had programmed the sound, I got Michael to come listen before we actually recorded it. He approved, and we recorded the part.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the &quot;Thriller&quot; album, you took part on the amazing music part of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. You played synthesizer on the most famous track in world of music ! What&rsquo;s your personal feeling ?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Tom Perry, engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/the-jacksons-triumph-engineer-tom-perry/"><span class="cs8567212B">Wax Poetics interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another time [Michael] called me, and we began working on some songs that he was demoing. One of them was &ldquo;Billie Jean.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m jumping ahead a little bit, but &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; was the last thing I worked on with Michael. We spent about three months on that single because we kept redoing the strings and horns on the demo. At some point, it was taken over by Quincy Jones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Quincy Jones, co-producer for other &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; songs, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">Telegraph (November 25, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102410/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael wrote Billie Jean - and that stuff, you know, it was just highly, highly personal. According to him, he said it was about a girl who climbed over [his] wall and he woke up one morning and she was laying out by the pool, lounging, hanging out with the shades on, bathing suit on... and Michael said she had accused him of being the father of one of her twins [laughs]. And Michael, on Billie Jean, he had an intro you could shave on it was so long. I said, &#39;It&#39;s too long, we gotta get to the melody quicker.&#39; He said, &#39;But that&#39;s the jelly! That&#39;s what makes me wanna dance.&#39; Now, when Michael Jackson tells you that&#39;s what makes him want to dance, the rest of us had to shut up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Gerri Hershey, writer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808114750/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/articletoread.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (1986)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was just finishing the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; track when I met him. He said he was curious how the public would react. A few moments later, when I asked about a snapshot tucked into a picture frame in his dining room, he said she was the real Billie Jean. She&#39;s &quot;just a girl&quot;, like the song says, a black teenager of average countenance, posing, most likely, for a high-school yearbook.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I want to memorize her face&quot;, he explained. &quot;In case she ever does turn up someplace. I need to recognize that face instantly.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In letters to him, the girl had insisted that Michael admit to paternity of her infant son; she sent photos of herself and the child, said the baby&#39;s eye looked like Michael&#39;s. Failing to get any satisfaction, she requested that the object of her desire kill himself in a specific way, and, according to Michael, was thoughtful enough to enclose the means of dispatch. He thought she&#39;d been institutionalized. Later that day, Katherine Jackson confirmed her son&#39;s story. Some guys have dream lovers, but this chick was a real nightmare. When Quincy Jones played a rough cut of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; in the studio, it gave me the willies. The vocal was edgier, fiercer than anything he&#39;d done. Oddly, Michael had never told his producer the real story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s gonna be a monster&quot;, Quincy hollered over the chorus.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Daryl Hall, singer/songwriter from &ldquo;Daryl Hall and John Oates&rdquo;, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Daryl Hall spoke in an interview that Michael came up to him at the &ldquo;We Are The World&rsquo; recording session and admitted he&rsquo;d used the groove line from the Hall &amp; Oates classic &lsquo;I Can&rsquo;t Go For That (No Can Do).&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael Jackson once said directly to me that he hoped I didn&rsquo;t mind that he copied that groove.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hall replied: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay; it&rsquo;s something we all do.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
