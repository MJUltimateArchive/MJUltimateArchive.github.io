While we were making Thriller, I even held on to &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; for a long time before I played it for Quincy. He kept telling me that we needed a great rock song for the album. He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Come on, where is it? I know you got it.&rdquo; I like my songs but initially I&rsquo;m shy about playing them for people, because I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t like them and that&rsquo;s a painful experience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He finally convinced me to let him hear what I had. I brought out &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; and played it for him and he went crazy. I felt on top of the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Before I wrote &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; I had been thinking I wanted to write the type of rock song that I would go out and buy, but also something totally different from the rock music I was hearing on Top 40 radio at the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; was written with school kids in mind. I&rsquo;ve always loved creating pieces that will appeal to kids. It&rsquo;s fun to write for them and know what they like because they&rsquo;re a very demanding audience. You can&rsquo;t fool them. They are still the audience that&rsquo;s most important to me, because I really care about them. If they like it, it&rsquo;s a hit, no matter what the charts say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The lyrics of &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; express something I would do if I were in trouble. Its message&mdash;that we should abhor violence&mdash;is something I believe deeply. It tells kids to be smart and avoid trouble. I don&rsquo;t mean to say you should turn the other cheek while someone kicks in your teeth, but, unless your back is against the wall and you have absolutely no choice, just get away before violence breaks out. If you fight and get killed, you&rsquo;ve gained nothing and lost everything. You&rsquo;re the loser, and so are the people who love you. That&rsquo;s what &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; is supposed to get across. To me true bravery is settling differences without a fight and having the wisdom to make that solution possible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...When Q called Eddie Van Halen, he thought it was a crank call. Because of the bad connection, Eddie was convinced that the voice on the other end was a fake. After being told to get lost, Q simply dialed the number again. Eddie agreed to play the session for us and gave us an incredible guitar solo on &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...We did go after a rock type of song with &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo; We got Eddie Van Halen to play guitar because we knew he&rsquo;d do the best job.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Quincy Jones, album co-producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">Telegraph (November 25, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102410/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191214075455/https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Beat It] was really key to this record, with its power, with everything it has, because I said at the time, &#39;I need a song like [The Knack&#39;s 1979 hit] My Sharona - we need a black version.&#39; That&#39;s a strong rock &#39;n&#39; roll thing there - that has the power of everything else [Jackson] writes. And he says, &#39;I got something here but I don&#39;t have any voices on it.&#39; It was just what we needed.

Quincy called and asked, &#39;Eddie?&#39; I say, &#39;Who&#39;s this?&#39; He didn&#39;t say anything &#39;cause he couldn&#39;t hear me. So I hung up. He called back. Same thing, he couldn&#39;t hear me. Third time he calls back, he goes, &#39;Eddie?&#39; And I said, &#39;What the fuck you want, you asshole?&#39; He says, &#39;This is Quincy Jones.&#39; &#39;Oh, my God. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry. I get so many crank calls that I didn&#39;t know.&#39; He asked, &#39;You know, there&#39;s this song we&#39;d like you to play on. Are you up for it?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Van Halen and his favorite engineer Donn Landee picked up a tape of &quot;Beat It&quot; and gave it a listen. They &quot;asked for some changes. I didn&#39;t want to do solo over the part they were asking me to solo over.&quot; Calling Quincy the next day, he suggested editing out certain parts of the song and to solo where he preferred it, and the alterations were made. When Van Halen plugged his guitar into the Westlake studio&#39;s console Landee sat next to him, Quincy and Michael behind him. Two solos and it was done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">More amazing than Van Halen&#39;s solos was that he wasn&#39;t paid for it. &quot;I didn&#39;t care&quot;, he says. &quot;I did it as a favor. I didn&#39;t want nothing.... Maybe Michael will give me dance lessons someday.... I got two more friends now. People don&#39;t understand that. I was a complete fool, according to the rest of the band and our manager and everybody else.&quot; But he also points out, with justification, that Van Halen benefited from the Jackson connection as much as &quot;Beat It&quot; was aided by his solo. &quot;Jump&quot; made the black singles chart, with Van Halen reaching an entirely new audience because of Eddie&#39;s generosity and skill. &quot;I&#39;m obsessed with music and I get off on playing and I don&#39;t care how much money someone makes off it.... Put it this way. I was not used. I knew what I was doing. I don&#39;t do anything unless I want to do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=oeCX4_OmzLYC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CI+just+noodled+along%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MPMLziaKn0&amp;sig=ACfU3U3j3iV59ak0mQLqU42w5xtH2cRQVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgyJTIuOfiAhVOT6wKHR9BBNUQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Guitar World&rdquo; magazine (February 1990)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190613215149/https://books.google.com/books?id=oeCX4_OmzLYC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CI+just+noodled+along%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MPMLziaKn0&amp;sig=ACfU3U3j3iV59ak0mQLqU42w5xtH2cRQVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgyJTIuOfiAhVOT6wKHR9BBNUQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CI%20just%20noodled%20along%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Guitar World&quot;: &quot;Beat It&quot; created such a buzz. How did your involvement with that song come about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Van Halen: Quincy Jones called me up to ask if I wanted to play on Michael Jackson&#39;s record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GW: Of course, at the time, Michael Jackson wasn&#39;t the pop icon that he is today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Halen: I didn&#39;t think he was. But when that record came out, it sure was a big one! It was really funny. I was out back, and something was wrong with the phone. And you know, there&#39;s always people calling me. So I said, &quot;Hello?&quot; And there was this guy answering, &quot;Hello?&quot; We couldn&#39;t hear each other, so I hung up. And then the call came again: &quot;Is this Eddie? It&#39;s Quincy, man!&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Who the hell? What do you want, you asshole?&quot; [laughs] So finally he says, &quot;It&#39;s Quincy Jones, man!&quot; And I&#39;m thinking, Oh shit&mdash;I&#39;m sorry, man. It was really funny. After the record, he wrote me a letter thanking me, signed, &quot;The Asshole.&quot; [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GW: Did you work the solo out before you cut it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Halen: No, I just noodled along. I actually changed part of the song, though, because they wanted me to solo over the break. So I said, &quot;Can we edit it to a verse, so there&#39;s some chord changes?&quot; Then I just soloed over what I thought should be the solo section. I did two solos, and they picked the one they liked. That was it. It took about 20 minutes to do. And there was Michael, standing in the back saying [mimics Michael Jackson] &quot;I really like that high fast stuff you do!&quot; [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GW: It seemed logical to assume that as of result of &quot;Beat It&quot; you&#39;d receive a lot of offers to play on other people&#39;s records. Yet we haven&#39;t seen you do much of that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Halen: Yeah, well, just recently Stevie Nicks...Steve Perg... everybody&#39;s calling. Thank God I have an answering machine! [laughs] Believe it or not, I did the Michael Jackson thing because I figured nobody&#39;d know. I swear to God. The band&mdash;Roth, my brother and Mike&mdash;always hated me doing things outside of Van Halen. They&#39;d say, &quot;Keep it in the band.&quot; And it just so happened that Roth was on one of his Amazon jungle trips or whatever he does, and A1 was out of town, and Mike was out at Disneyland or something, so I couldn&#39;t consult them. So I just said, &quot;Damn it, I&#39;ll do it and no one will ever know.&quot; So then it comes out and becomes song of the year and everything.
