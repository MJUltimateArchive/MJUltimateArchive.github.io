He needed help with it, so we all got in the studio with him because he played piano a little bit. So when he played the song on the piano and he was telling me how he wanted it to go, I said, &#39;You do it,&#39; and I left the studio and let him do it, and he did an excellent job!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I came back in when he started to overdub his voice, and he had all these great ideas about how to record his voice, like doubling his voice, doing all kinds of little ad libs and whatever. He had it all thought out in his head. As a matter of fact, they had two songs on each album. They had &#39;Blues Away&#39; and &#39;You&#39;ve Got to Change Your Style of Life.&#39; Michael wrote &#39;Blues Away&#39; by himself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
