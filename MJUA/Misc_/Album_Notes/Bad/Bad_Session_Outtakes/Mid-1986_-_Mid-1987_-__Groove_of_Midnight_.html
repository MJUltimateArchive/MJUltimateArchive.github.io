Songwriter Rod Temperton, who was part of the A-Team behind Off the Wall and Thriller, submitted a few songs for BAD, one of them being Groove of Midnight. This song was eventually recorded by Siedah Garrett and was released on her debut album KISS of Life on Qwest Records (1988). &ldquo;Rod Temperton had some songs&rdquo;, remembers Matt Forger. &ldquo;Quincy asked him to have songs ready. Groove of Midnight is one of these songs. However we searched and we could not find a version with Michael&rsquo;s vocals. It wasn&rsquo;t a song that they considered for the BAD album eventually&rdquo;.</span></p></body>
