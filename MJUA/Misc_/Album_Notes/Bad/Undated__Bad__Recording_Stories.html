And when it came to Bad, I told him it&rsquo;s time to go against all the publicity and walk into the eye of the fire and tell the truth about everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He eventually wrote nine songs for Bad. The album had five No 1 records.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/is-michael-jackson-for-real-19870924"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (September 24, 1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It took three men to carry Crusher, a 300-pound, twenty-foot python into Studio D of Westlake Audio in Los Angeles, where the recording of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> took place. Most in the Jackson camp are accustomed to seeing Michael&#39;s pets in the studio; Bubbles once even rode around on the back of engineer Bruce Swedien&#39;s Great Dane. But when one afternoon synthesizer ace Greg Phillinganes wandered into the studio and came face to face with Crusher, he &quot;freaked,&quot; says Quincy Jones. &quot;Small heart attack. Greg Phillinganes could be an hors d&#39;oeuvre for that snake.&quot; Michael just sat back, watching the scene, laughing to himself in that soft, high voice&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the recording sessions, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> loomed over everyone &ndash; especially Michael. He had written sixty-two songs, and during 1985 he recorded dozens of forty-eight-track demos at his home studio, including a cover of &quot;Come Together,&quot; one of his favorite Beatles tunes. By the time he and Jones moved to Westlake on August 4th, 1986, pressure was mounting. &quot;There was so much stress,&quot; says guitarist David Williams, &quot;and so much tension&quot; that &quot;I was doing the exact same part at least five different times on each song. They were trying to match the other one, the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album, at least.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the studio Michael usually dressed casually but sometimes showed up wearing, as Jones put it, &quot;this Captain Marvel stuff&quot; or &quot;a beautiful, chic suit.&quot; While recording his vocals, Michael demanded the lights be turned off and almost always danced; there&#39;s a permanent wooden stage with mirrors built into Studio D&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout the sessions, celebrity friends were encouraged to stop by to relieve the tedium: Spielberg, Sean Lennon, Emmanuel Lewis, Robert De Niro and Oprah Winfrey all popped in. As Michael has become the world&#39;s biggest celebrity, he&#39;s also become the biggest fan. Fame seems the one constant in his life: the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> liner notes thank Cary Grant and Marlon Brando&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You need a dramatic deadline,&quot; admits Jones today. &quot;I swear to you, it doesn&#39;t happen without that. We&#39;d have been in the studio for another year.&quot; In the end, the hundreds of reek of digital tape used for </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> fill an entire room at Westlake. The record took more than two years to complete (</span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was recorded in just three months) and cost more than $2 million. And now it was time for Michael to leave his magic kingdom and try to sell some product.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.spin.com/2014/06/michael-jackson-bad-1987-cover-story/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Spin&rdquo; Magazine (June 1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s March 1987, and it&rsquo;s getting late. Westlake Studio is deserted except for Michael, Quincy, Bubbles the chimpanzee, and a few technicians. &ldquo;Smelly,&rdquo; as Jones calls Michael, still wants to lay down more vocal tracks. On the recording console in front of Quincy sits a comic strip clipped from a newspaper, the punch line to which reads: &ldquo;Michael Jackson is 30 years old and he&rsquo;s never had a date.&rdquo; Michael picks it up and reads it. Then he puts it back gently and turns away. He seems hurt by the words. Half a beat passes, then he giggles like a schoolboy, and walks into the recording booth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Alone in the semidarkness, illuminated softly by a single spotlight, he starts to sing&hellip; He attacks the song, dancing, waving his hands, moving with unexpected power...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then the song is over. Quincy looks on approvingly: it&rsquo;s a take. Michael walks over to the console and gives him a hug. Then he pulls a surgical mask from his pocket, slips it over his head, and takes off into the L.A. night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://people.com/archive/cover-story-unlike-anyone-even-himself-vol-28-no-11/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;People&rdquo; magazine (September 14, 1987)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170806094817/https://people.com/archive/cover-story-unlike-anyone-even-himself-vol-28-no-11/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115324/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/princeharry.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived scan of magazine article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Frank Dileo, Jackson&rsquo;s manager, protector, friend and spokesman, doesn&rsquo;t seem worried. &ldquo;Everyone kind of wonders what sort of pressure Michael felt,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The answer is simple: none. The attitude was to go in, make the best album you can, and present it. I think we&rsquo;ve done that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Russ Ragsdale, studio engineer during &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; sessions, &ldquo;<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4366557&amp;postcount=392"><span class="cs8567212B">Gearslutz&rdquo; forum (July 11, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190624205846/https://www.gearslutz.com/board/showpost.php?p=4366557&amp;postcount=392"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Eagle_CFC (Forum user)</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Out of interest, what songs would Michael sing when he was around the studio, russrags mentioned some Beatles songs, just be cool to know what songs got stuck in his head!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Russ Ragsdale</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: 1st off, the song I always heard Michael singing around the Studio was &quot;Black Dog&quot; by Led Zep. Truly amazing to witness 1st hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once I was out at Michael&#39;s Studio on Havenhurst in Encino, and I was going through a stack of vinyl records sitting by the console. One of the records I came across was Grace Jones &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;. I picked it up to look at it front and back and Michael got kind of excited about it too. He took the record from me and asked if I&#39;d like to hear a song that was very influential to him, and I thought are you kidding, YES please. He put on a song called &quot;Feel Up&quot; from that record and I about fell over!!! All the little inflections Michael creates with his voice on his records, are present on this Grace Jones track from 1981. Please check this song out, anyone reading this thread will be glad they did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Eagle_CFC: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Any stories regarding jokes or practical jokes (I love the pie in face story btw) or was MJ more professional in the studio haha!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Ragsdale</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: One fear of mine was that I knew there&rsquo;d come a day that it would be just Michael and I in the same room one on one. I&rsquo;d rehearsed it in the mirror over and over, just what was I going to say to this guy??? Well that day came, and what was probably seconds, seemed like a very long time. Catering had arrived at the Studio and here Michael and I were standing by ourselves. I was looking at the floor and said to myself, &ldquo;this is it, this is what I&lsquo;ve been afraid of, I&rsquo;m going to have to break the ice.&rdquo; I took a big deep breath and raised my head to speak and &hellip; wham .. I got hit with a handful of corn, I thought, &ldquo;oh no this is going to be war&rdquo; &hellip; I picked up some pickles and threw them at Michael, then he threw something else and it went back and forth for a while. We were laughing so hard (I had to clean it all up later of course) but for three weeks we couldn&rsquo;t look at each other without laughing. What a great way for him to make me feel at ease. Michael really has a great sense of humor, he just loves seeing people do a 3 stooges act and fumble all over themselves. I wish there were more people in the world exactly like Michael Jackson, he is truly one amazing human being.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csE52E8F9B">&ldquo;Moonwalker&rdquo; Misc.

Musically, the man always knows what he wants to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...More so than for &quot;Thriller&quot;, the drum tracks on &quot;Bad&quot; were a blend of programming and live playing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I did a lot of pre-programming at my studio, then brought those files in&quot;, explains JR. &quot;In those days, I had a giant electronics rack by my acoustic drum set. Today, I absolutely abhor that, I think triggering and that is just... eeeuuhhhh.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As JR found out, Bruce Swedien and Quincy Jones had gone in a very different direction capturing the rhythmic components for the new album. With his Yamaha kit and a selection of electronics, JR went down to the studio expecting a similar working situation to his experience on &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Bruce Swedien would have a digital machine and an analogue machine with 16 track heads for fatness and all that stuff&quot;, says JR. &quot;They go, &#39;We want you to record the entire song for 12 minutes&#39;, and Quincy goes, &#39;And I don&#39;t want any fills.&#39; I go, &#39;Holy shit, this sounds like a James Brown audition.&#39; First of all, &#39;Bad&#39; is not that difficult, but when you are in your ninth minute of doing the same groove perfectly, your mind starts to wander. Some of the other ones, like &#39;Smooth Criminal&#39;, it&#39;s not an easy tune to play for a long time without a drum fill. &#39;The Way You Make Me Feel&#39;, that is not an easy groove to play with the triplets on the hi-hat for that long a time either.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As if that was not enough of a challenge, many tracks were little more than skeletons, musically speaking, when JR was laying down his parts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Did I hear melodies and lyrics? No, I didn&#39;t&quot;, he explains. &quot;Let&#39;s compare this to a Japanese session from the &#39;80s. All of us would get called to do a Japanese session, we would get tracks with nothing on them. Especially the guitar players would go, &#39;We don&#39;t know what to play&#39;, because there was no reference melody or even chord pattern.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Happily JR&#39;s experience working with Michael in the past gave an insider&#39;s insight in knowing what to take his cue from. &quot;When you hear the bass line for &#39;Smooth Criminal&#39;, you know he&#39;s going to be working off that bass line for his melody&quot;, he says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;I always felt that after we had cut &#39;Off the Wall&#39; and moved into &#39;Bad&#39;, I wanted him to go for more of a rock/Prince direction, me personally&quot;, he says. &quot;I think that&#39;s okay for me to say that. There was another track I did that never made it called &#39;Apocalypse Now&#39; that I wrote six and a half minutes of military drum cadences for, I brought in Don Williams, John Williams&#39; brother, Dan Greco, and Bob Zimmitti, and we recorded with four field snares, four piccolo snares, two sets of piatti, and one gran casa. It was a very hip tune, but it never made the record. I was kind of upset about that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Leon &ldquo;Ndugu&rdquo; Chandler, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ndugu Chandler was the second familiar face on those sessions, although he only cut one track and his experience was the polar opposite to JR Robinson&#39;s marathon no-fills sessions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The funny thing is, when we did &#39;Thriller&#39;, all my parts were overdub parts. When I did &#39;Bad&#39;, we did &#39;I Just Can&#39;t Stop Loving You&#39; as a live session with everybody there together, including Michael&quot;, says Ndugu. &quot;We were all basically in the same room over at Westlake on Santa Monica. When I say &#39;live&#39;, we had piano, bass, drums, guitar, and vocals together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Recording in the same room with Michael, Ndugu says the superstar got down to work like any other professional.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;In all these environments, there were no bodyguards, no security once he got into the studio&quot;, says Ndugu. &quot;Once he got into the studio, he was a Regular Joe. We all sat and ate together, we talked, and he was there and one of the guys, one of the musicians.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Again, Ndugu picks out Quincy Jones as the mastermind behind the &quot;Bad&quot; sessions and he came away from the experience inspired by the producer&#39;s creativity and artistic boldness.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;For me, Quincy Jones was a super talent as a producer. Not only was he a great producer, he had the psychology of production together. That was one of the most important things that I got out of it, but what I also got out of it was to not be afraid to take chances and to follow your own lead. Those were the greatest things I got out of working with Quincy, Michael, and Bruce. Follow your own lead and don&#39;t be afraid. They followed what they felt should do and they set the trends.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brad Sundberg, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.facebook.com/inthestudiowithmj/posts/some-anniversaries-are-celebrations-others-have-a-more-somber-tone-its-odd-that-/583682785138953/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirrored Facebook post (Late June 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627172205/https://www.facebook.com/inthestudiowithmj/posts/some-anniversaries-are-celebrations-others-have-a-more-somber-tone-its-odd-that-/583682785138953/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Early in 1986 the team moved into Westlake Studio D in Hollywood to record the BAD album, and welcomed me in. I worked other sessions during the day, but at night I was invited to sit in and learn. Eventually I worked my way up to technical director for the team, and the trust was solidified. It was during this time that Michael nicknamed me &quot;Really Really Brad,&quot; a twist on the chorus, &quot;Bad, Bad, Really Really Bad.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Over the next ten years I worked with Michael doing tour prep for the BAD tour in 1988, then back in the studio for the Dangerous album in Los Angeles, followed by the HIStory album in New York. Toss in countless music videos, the HIStory tour, the Moonwalker project, Blood On The Dance Floor album, and various side projects, and I got to know him pretty well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So who was Michael Jackson, and why did he have such a profound effect on my life? Not for a moment do I pretend to have been his closest friend or a confidant. Rather I worked for him and with him, and considered it an honor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was a consummate professional. If his vocals were scheduled for a noon downbeat, he was there at 10 am, with his vocal coach Seth, singing scales. Yes, scales. I would set up the mic, check the equipment, make coffee, and all the while he would sing scales for two hours.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He typically drove himself to the studio alone. For a while he drove a big Chevy Blazer with dents and scrapes on it. He was not a great driver. More than once he called into the studio to say he would be late after being in a fender bender.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was intensely curious about &quot;normal life.&quot; He asked me about Christmas, and couldn&#39;t understand how kids could wait until Christmas morning to open the gifts. You see, he was raised Jehovah&#39;s Witness, so Christmas was not celebrated in the Jackson family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since I was so close to this world, let me try to give you some insight. A &quot;typical&quot; MJ album would take between 10 and 16 months in the studio. His budget allowed for as many as 100 songs to be recorded for any given project. Some would be discarded early on, while others were fine tuned. Musicians would be brought in to add their textures and ideas, but in the center of it all was Michael. The team was remarkably small given the scope of the projects. Each project was slightly different, but typically there were less then eight of us working day to day, from the first day until the project was mastered. No entourage. No Elephant Man bones. No groupies. No drugs. Just music. And food.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the BAD album, Fridays quickly became known as &quot;Family Friday.&quot; He would have his two chefs, affectionately known as the Slam Dunk Sisters, prepare a large dinner for the crew, musicians and any family members that might be around. Since I was working sometimes 80+ hours a week, it was not uncommon for Deb to come have dinner with us. Michael loved these family get togethers. In later projects I would bring my girls, whom he loved and would play with. There is one moment in time in my head when Deb brought my daughter Amanda, who was just a baby at the time, into the studio for the afternoon. She set up a play mat and brought some toys, and Michael sat and played with her for a while. He looked at Deb and said, &quot;This is her own little world, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When you work in this environment, your sense of normal begins to shift. It was not uncommon for celebrities or VIPs to stop in. One day the Secret Service searched the building for a couple hours before Nancy Reagan came for a visit. Next it was Princess Stephanie from Monaco. (She has a cameo on the song &quot;In The Closet.&quot;) The chimps were common guests in the studio, as was a giant snake, both of which I would wind up holding during MJ&#39;s vocals. Michael loved mixing fun and work, but work always came first.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I have watched him write many songs, and the process is amazing. I asked him where they came from, and he said they were gifts from God. He could hear the entire song in his head before we could get tape on the machines. He would sometimes sing the drums, bass, percussion, keyboards, etc., and we would later bring in musicians to replace his demo tracks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His lounge would be decorated with Disney posters and old Hollywood memorabilia. He loved innocence, and displayed gentleness, humor and patience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This driving work ethic also had to escape from time to time. There were many days we would show up at the studio, only to find he had flown to Europe or Japan for a few days, and neglected to tell us. This sometimes meant an unscheduled few days off for us, which was awesome.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Elton John, singer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8080705/Elton-John-interview.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Daily Telegraph&rdquo; (October 25, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190703163622/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8080705/Elton-John-interview.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember talking to Michael once when he did Thriller and I said, &ldquo;How are you going to top that?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh, the next one&rsquo;s going to do twice as much&rdquo;, and I thought, Michael, it&rsquo;s not. You can&rsquo;t. You put so much pressure on yourself.</span></p></body>
