Unable to agree, Michael and Quincy held a meeting with Frank DiLeo. When DiLeo heard &lsquo;Streetwalker&rsquo; he remained in his seat, yet when &lsquo;Another Part of Me&rsquo; was played he began to dance. &ldquo;DiLeo helped me get &lsquo;Another Part of Me&rsquo; because he started shaking his butt on it,&rdquo; Quincy said. &ldquo;I said [to DiLeo], &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not helping Michael at all&rsquo;!&rdquo; &lsquo;Another Part of Me&rsquo; came out on top, and Matt Forger&rsquo;s 1986 Captain EO mix was remixed for the album by Bruce Swedien.</span></p></body>
