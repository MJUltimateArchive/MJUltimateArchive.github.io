Frank agreed that there was a difference. Michael especially noticed this on the song &lsquo;Smooth Criminal&rsquo;.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Smooth Criminal&rdquo;:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &quot;Michael Jackson: Private Home Movies&quot; (April 24, 2003)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Every time I do an album I write almost nearly 100 or over a 100 songs, so we have to skittle them down, and &ldquo;Smooth Criminal&rdquo; almost didn&rsquo;t make it on the album. And, on top of that, it was on the album, I decided that I would make it a western. I went on the ranch on the property and I had a cameraman, pretty much, shoot me, coming up with ideas of how I wanted this thing to be, and I wanted hats and the wind and just a lot of things you know some quick cut big shot some long shots. And, at the last minute, I said, &ldquo;Nah, I don&rsquo;t want it as a western, it should be like hot summer night in Chicago 1945 and underground kinda thing going on&rdquo;. I think that was the best way to go. It&#39;s one of my favorite pieces. I get more comments on Smooth Criminal than any of the other pieces I&#39;ve ever done really.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jermaine Jackson, &ldquo;You Are Not Alone: Michael: Through a Brother&#39;s Eyes&rdquo; (September 13, 2011)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Smooth Criminal&rdquo; was actually inspired by a serial killer who spread fear throughout Los Angeles and San Francisco between 1984 and 1985. Richard Ramirez, a self-confessed devil worshipper, was the &ldquo;Night Stalker&rdquo; who took 14 lives. In most cases, he forced his way into people&rsquo;s homes before brutally murdering them with a knife (hence the appearance of a flashing blade in the video).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Opening heartbeat heard on the song was Michael&rsquo;s, recorded by Dr Eric Chevlan, and digitally processed in a synclavier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Annie, are you OK?&rdquo; was inspired by the standard name given to CPR demonstration dummies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Voice of the police chief who says, &lsquo;Everybody please leave the area right now!&rsquo; was that of Bruce Swedien.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Al Capone&rdquo; (Demo):</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Matt Forger, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/09/abortion-fame-and-bad-listening-to-michael-jacksons-unreleased-demos/262242/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Atlantic&rdquo; (September 11, 2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/2018*/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/09/abortion-fame-and-bad-listening-to-michael-jacksons-unreleased-demos/262242/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is an example of a song where a part of it inspires the next version of the song. There have been many cases where Michael has done that, where he would dwell on a song and refine concepts, or lyrics or melodies. The bass line in &#39;Al Capone&#39;&mdash;you can see how it evolved into &#39;Smooth Criminal.&#39; And the whole gangster theme carried over&mdash;though as it evolved it became less about a particular historical figure and more about a situation and a story. You can also hear Michael experimenting with this staccato-type of vocal, this rapid wordplay that he would later use.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://mjdatabank.com/mjjnews/wordpress/2012/10/09/chicago-1945-was-done-prior-to-al-capone-matt-forger-the-secrets-of-bad-25-en/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MJ Data Bank&rdquo; interview (October 9, 2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181228065047/http://mjdatabank.com/mjjnews/wordpress/2012/10/09/chicago-1945-was-done-prior-to-al-capone-matt-forger-the-secrets-of-bad-25-en/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song was recorded at Hayvenhurst and Matt Forger remembers the original angle of the track: &ldquo;Al Capone was written around an actual historical figure. It sets the groundwork for the song that became Smooth Criminal. Michael used many of the same themes and similar ideas to create Smooth Criminal&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Al Capone was about a historical figure, Jackson refined his vision and opted for another totally different story: &ldquo;In Smooth Criminal he wrote a story and made it unique. It was not about a historical figure like Al Capone. He made his own story and this was something new and fresh in his vision&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just like ideas and elements from Streetwalker were reworked to create the very first version of the song Dangerous, Al Capone and Smooth Criminal were crafted with the same kind of elements. And actually, both songs seem to be derived from another song that Jackson recorded earlier and that has been widely talked about by MJ music fans: &ldquo;Chicago 1945 was done prior to Al Capone&rdquo;, explains Matt Forger. &ldquo;It spoke about an era in time, about what was happening at that time in Chicago, that year. It was almost as if you were reading the newspapers at that time. It was a song that maybe Michael used as the idea for Al Capone, and Al Capone was the idea for Smooth Criminal. So maybe there were some similarities but this is a different song. Al Capone was a definite new approach and Smooth Criminal was much more refined&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.showbiz411.com/2012/08/27/michael-jackson-exclusive-liner-notes-from-bad25"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Bad 25&rdquo; album liner notes</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323100513/https://www.showbiz411.com/2012/08/27/michael-jackson-exclusive-liner-notes-from-bad25"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When you listen to some early demos of songs, you can tell instantly what song it is. This is NOT one of those songs. It is an example of how different a song can be during its early stages of development from its later, finished polished version. If it were not a well known fact that &ldquo;Smooth Criminal&rdquo; was developed out of &ldquo;Al Capone,&rdquo; it would be hard to know that it had its roots in the material based on listening to this early recording.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I recorded the demo for Smooth Criminal at the Bee Gees studio in the 1980s,&rdquo; said Bruce Swedien. &ldquo;It was called &lsquo;Al Capone&rsquo; at the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Steve Porcaro, co-writer of spiritual predecessor &ldquo;Chicago 1945&rdquo; song, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Years ago, Michael and I wrote a song called Chicago 1945 &ndash; I did the music and Michael the lyrics,&rsquo; Porcaro confirmed on Toto&rsquo;s web-site. &lsquo;He recorded the song twice, but never put it on an album&hellip; the instruments were played in a constant rhythm in the 16th note, which was called &lsquo;yada&rsquo;.
