It was the first time he filmed a video while an album was still in production, keeping him out of the studio for many weeks&hellip; With the &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; video complete and the Christmas break over, Michael and the A-Team resumed recording at Westlake in early January 1987&hellip; Final mixes were completed on July 9, and the next day Bruce Swedien took the tapes to Bernie Grundman&rsquo;s for mastering.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, Moonwalk autobiography</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The Way You Make Me Feel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Smooth Criminal&rdquo; are simply the grooves I was in at the time.

I helped inspire one of the tunes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I want you to write a song with a shuffling kind of rhythm,&rdquo; I said to him one day. I tried to sing to him what I heard in my head.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; he said, nodding.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A week or two later Michael played me the song he&rsquo;d written.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I was talking about!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Michael smiled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song was &ldquo;The Way You Make Me Feel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, Michael refused to play me any of the other songs he had in the works.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Please let me hear, please let me hear,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d beg him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No, Mother, wait until the album comes out,&rdquo; Michael would reply. &ldquo;Be surprised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, however, was only too happy to tell me of his expectations for his next album.

When Michael recorded his vocals during the main sessions later down the line, he sang while dancing around the customary darkened studio, clicking his fingers and stomping his feet on the ground. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d sing his line, then he&rsquo;d disappear into the darkness,&rdquo; Bruce Swedien recalls. But instead of editing those sounds out of the final version, Swedien kept them as he felt they enhanced the overall sonic value.</span></p></body>
