You can just tell it&#39;s an emotionally charged song. It&#39;s clearly based on his experience. But Michael often did songs that are based on his experience but blended with other characters and people&#39;s experiences as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was a special version of The Price of Fame with different lyrics for Pepsi. I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people ever heard it. But this is the original version of The Price of Fame on BAD 25, and it was recorded at Hayvenhurst.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is Michael talking about very personal experiences. It is about the kind of things that happened in his life, especially after the success of Thriller. His popularity was so extreme that he was not able to go out in public at all without attention.</span></p></body>
