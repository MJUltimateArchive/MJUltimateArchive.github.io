But once he asked me to give him piano lessons. I told him: &quot;Ok Michael, do it seriously. Every day, you&#39;ll sit with me for 15 minutes and there will be a little lesson. But he never had the patience to apply themselves to this discipline. [laughs] I think he knew he did not need to play an instrument to express his talent. While he may not have played an instrument, he was still a fantastic musician. He instinctively understood the music. It was just part of him ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Do you experiment a lot while recording a title?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yes, because Michael loved finding new sounds that the human ear had ever heard. Often, he repeated: &quot;Brad, get me a sound that hurts really bad.&quot; That meant he wanted something that shakes him inside. Even if we had much use of machines and computers to design some sounds of drums, sometimes we find more ideas ... organic, I would say. For example, we came banging on the lid of a grand piano with a baseball bat-ball kick to design a specific drum. [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: You&#39;ve recorded new songs with Michael after Invincible. You can tell us about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yes, the newest piece on which we worked, Michael and me, From The Bottom Of My Heart, the title was out to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina ... Overall, the songs we recorded during the latest years are of exceptional quality. Contrary to popular belief Michael was not an artistic decline. He bubbled with ideas. And these songs on which we worked are more original and more creative than we&#39;ve done together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Michael has never been lacking inspiration?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No. At no time in his life Michael has been lack of inspiration ... Plus he went through many trials, as has been the case in 2005 with the trial, and this had a positive influence on creativity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Do you think we will hear in the near future these songs recorded during the last years of his life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I am not allowed to speak, but it is very likely ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Are you staying in contact with Michael afterwards?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Last year, he called me to work with him again. The problem is that having spent my pilot&#39;s license, I had just been hired by an airline. And projects like Michael were quite vague and did not even have a label behind him, I could not risk giving my resignation and losing one job like that. I needed to know where I was and there, in this case, it was not the case at all. Having 51 years today, I might never be committed again later. To my regret, so I had to refuse to work with him again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Black &amp; White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What are the best memories you keep of Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Brad Buxer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: All those laughs we had together ... I remember the races we were in the corridors of the hotel when we were on tour, or the food fights in our rooms ... But mostly, I always remember his smile when we listened to a song completed. There was a lot of pride, love and respect in this regard. And the feeling was mutual ... For nearly 20 years, I have been fortunate to count Michael among my best friends. We had the same age, him and me. Needless to say I miss him terribly ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, audio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/nightlife/features/47895-the-making-of-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Time Out&rdquo; (Abu Dhabi) (December 24, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200225225950/https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/nightlife/features/47895-the-making-of-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the inescapable attributes of Jackson&rsquo;s music is the highly polished production. Swedish sound engineer Bruce Swedien was largely responsible for the pop icon&rsquo;s definitive sound.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He explains that he and Jones referred to this as &lsquo;the Acusonic Recording Process, adding: &lsquo;Some guy from Japan came on a plane to California wanting to buy an Acusonic recording processor. We used it to describe the way that I worked with sounds. It means &lsquo;accurate science&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This process encapsulated Quincy Jones and Bruce Swedien&rsquo;s ability and willingness to experiment with sound. Swedien recalls one of the tricks he used with Jackson. &lsquo;Michael would sing close to the mic, then we&rsquo;d have him move back a little further. What that does is create a sonic energy with the sound, which means that when you combine those tracks it&rsquo;s magic and you can stagger them and have one right, one left and one in the middle.&rsquo;</span></p></body>
