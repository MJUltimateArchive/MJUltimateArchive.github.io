Was that a favorite of Michael&#39;s?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was, but if you look at the fact that it didn&#39;t make it onto the Invincible album, it shows you that he didn&#39;t feel it was as strong as what made it on the Invincible album. But maybe, in that case, if he would&#39;ve asked me, I would&#39;ve said, &quot;Well, I think it should be on there&quot;. But that was a Michael decision. &quot;Hollywood Tonight&quot;, I still love that song. In fact, they weren&#39;t even aware of that song when they were working on the &quot;Michael&quot; album, and I remember speaking to someone--I won&#39;t mention any names--mentioning that that was one of the last songs that Michael wanted to work on again, that Michael wanted to listen to again, that Michael wanted to maybe add a vocal thing to, and when they heard that, they said, &quot;Well, can we hear it?&quot; and I played it for them, and it ended up being on the record. Of course, a changed version.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, because it&#39;s clear that the demo has the vocals that didn&#39;t come out on the final version. I&#39;m pretty sure the demo [contains the lyrics] &quot;she was only fifteen&quot;, and then on the final version, that line isn&#39;t even in there. Why would they take that out? Who--did you--who took that out? That would&#39;ve been Teddy&#39;s production team, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was probably an idea that Teddy floated to the label, and the label says, &quot;You know what? That&#39;s not a bad idea, take that out&quot; And Teddy also wrote that spoken bridge part. I can&#39;t really say that that&#39;s my favorite part of the song either, but it did need something there. I mean, maybe a guitar solo would have been more interesting or something, I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There&#39;s handwritten lyrics of the bridge--isn&#39;t there--that Michael wrote that people haven&#39;t heard before. And usually when Michael wrote handwritten lyrics, something would have been recorded for that, like maybe even a melody or something like that. In the final version of &quot;Hollywood Tonight&quot; that you&#39;ve heard, is it more complete than the version on the album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Mmmmm, I like it much better than the version that&#39;s on the album. I haven&#39;t listened to it in a while, I couldn&#39;t tell you. But, I mean, I know that the version I&#39;ve listened to the most--when we get to the bridge, Michael&#39;s sort of talking, and you can hear him saying, &quot;Ok, the drums stay in here&quot;, and he&#39;s saying other little things that are almost like a producer, but I&#39;m not sure that I was even aware he had written lyrics for the bridge until I heard it from--probably from Damien. Because you&#39;re right, if he had written words to the bridge, why wouldn&#39;t they have used the words Michael wrote, even if somebody had to speak it because they didn&#39;t know what the melody was. So I&#39;m pretty sure nobody took the time, again, to really go back and--and like, I don&#39;t know where they found those lyrics, that&#39;d be interesting to find out where those lyrics were. Like I said, Brad has what&#39;s called a--well, it&#39;s a big road case. And it&#39;s full of what we call &quot;song packets&quot;, and a &quot;song packet&quot; basically is a big manila envelope that has everything that we have paperwork-wise, CD-wise, rough-mix-wise, and notes about the song. And so, some of them are quite full, and some of them have two CDs in them, depending on how much time we spent working on these, or how much development went into the song. One of my goals is to get to Brad&#39;s house, sometime next year, and go through the song packets and photograph, or Xerox... [or] scan all the written parts that are in those things. And some of them are like--if Brad wrote like a string part or multiple string parts for a string section to play, he would actually write all that stuff out on music staff paper, so some of it is music notation as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Michael Prince, you&#39;ve mentioned a few times during this conversation that people [are/were] not taking the time to properly research and put together these posthumous products. And when you consider two things. Firstly, Michael&#39;s stature as an artist, and secondly, his perfectionism. As somebody who worked with him so closely, how does it make you feel to see his work being treated in that way?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> More than anything, a little bit sad, not angry at all. And just makes me question who decides who to call and who not to call, because I can&#39;t imagine, and I--forget about me, I can&#39;t imagine somebody working on &quot;Hollywood Tonight&quot; without at least phoning Brad Buxer, who co-wrote that song, and saying, &quot;Can you come down to the studio for a couple days and tell us where Michael was headed with this song?&quot; It&#39;s almost like they sorta wanted to divorce, in many cases, the writers of the songs from the songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Dr. Freeze (Elliot Straite), co-writer and co-producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjfrance.com/actu/post/2011/01/28/Interview-exclusive%3A-Dr.-Freeze-fait-des-r%C3%A9v%C3%A9lations-sur-le-prochain-album.../3233"><span class="cs8567212B">MJFrance interview</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://michaeljacksonbeat.blogspot.com.au/2011/02/dr-freeze-on-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">translated</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quagmire (MJFrance): Are there any catches recorded at Neverland, which were used in the final mix of a song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Freeze: With regard to my records, all of them are from major studios. But he has recorded songs with other producers from Neverland. Unfortunately, I can not tell you exactly what songs. Ah yes, I remember a song that is present on his latest album. It&#39;s called &quot;Hollywood&quot; I believe, and I remember he had worked on it at Neverland.</span></p></body>
