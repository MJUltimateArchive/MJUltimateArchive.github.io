Now, these three musical icons have created an inspiring musical landscape entitled &quot;I Have This Dream,&quot; and they&#39;re asking AOL members to come up with an optimistic and uplifting lyric to complete this anthemic song.

The winning lyric, as judged by the song&#39;s co-writers Carole Bayer Sager, David Foster and Michael Jackson, came from Ric Kipp of Nashville, Tennessee.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;After receiving so many great entries, making a final decision was extremely difficult,&quot; says Sager. &quot;However, in the end, we felt that Ric Kipp from Nashville best captured the lyrical vision that David, Michael and I had when we first began writing this song.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;After choosing Ric, we flew him out to Los Angeles for a co-writing session with David and I, and we are proud of the final lyric. Ric proved himself to be very professional and a very accomplished lyricist in his own right, who truly worked hand-in-hand with us on this song and the results of this collaboration are now here for all to see.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;re currently working out a time for Michael to come in and record his vocals on this project.

Jackson, Sager and Foster selected Kipp&rsquo;s lyrics from over 1,000 entries, saying his words &ldquo;best reflected our vision for the song.&rdquo; In July, Kipp was flown to Los Angeles for a co-writing session with Sager and Foster, where the trio completed the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Originally from New Orleans, Ric Kipp grew up on a gumbo of blues, rock, jazz and country influences. After headlining clubs in the Big Easy and throughout the South, Kipp took his well-received roots rock band west to LA, where he won a BMI-sponsored songwriting contest resulting in an indie record deal. On a trip to Nashville, Kipp was offered a songwriting deal by publishing legend Buddy Killen. After relocating from Los Angeles, Kipp formed a roots country band and toured the South and Europe. He has recorded with Steve Earle, has had songs in film soundtracks and has a song on the current Confederate Railroad CD.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kipp will return to Los Angeles later this summer, when Jackson will record his vocals on the project, possibly with an all-star roster of artists -- not unlike his 1985 famine relief anthem &ldquo;We Are The World.&quot; All proceeds from the project will be donated to children&rsquo;s relief organizations around the world.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.foxnews.com/story/jacko-charity-song-burns-contest-winner"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Fox News&rdquo; (January 19, 2006)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190930192656/https://www.foxnews.com/story/jacko-charity-song-burns-contest-winner"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ric Kipp, who describes himself as being in his mid-40s, is a veteran Nashville musician who works in a local wine store for $9 an hour. In 2002, he entered a songwriting competition sponsored by AOL on behalf of writers-producers David Foster and Carole Bayer-Sager for their now defunct music company, Tonos (their other partner was Kenny &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds).</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">The contest promised the winner that Jackson would record their song and possibly place it on an album. The song would be used for charitable purposes. Jackson was advertised as the composer of the instrumental part of the song.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">But now the song, called &quot;I Have This Dream,&quot; could be part of an interesting authorship dispute. Kipp won the contest with his lyrics. Kipp tells me that when he was brought to a Los Angeles studio for the prize recording, Foster told him he was excited about the lyrics and wanted to use his work. But the award-winning Bayer-Sager, Kipp says, was intent on using her own lyrics.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately, this would completely contradict the press release Tonos, Jackson and AOL released on May 10, 2002, which included this wordage:</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The contest gives AOL members the opportunity to co-write a song with the BMI-affiliated &quot;King of Pop,&quot; as well as with Foster and Bayer-Sager. The winning submission will be recorded by Jackson himself and may be released as part of an upcoming album. All proceeds from the song will be donated to children&#39;s charities around the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kipp tells me that after he won the contest he was brought out to Los Angeles. Tonos and AOL gave him $1,500 for expenses, did not put him up at a hotel and kept him waiting in the studio for Jackson for several days before giving up the ghost.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was simply not coming. He never did show for the promised recording session.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kipp says he not only wrote the lyrics but composed a musical &quot;bridge&quot; for Foster, who recorded the finished product with one of Faith Hill&#39;s female back-up singers.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kipp says that Foster&#39;s son-in-law, Simon Gillies, even videotaped the writing sessions for a possible documentary about the contest. In the end, Kipp says he went home and &quot;I never heard from any of these people again.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gillies, who ran the A&amp;R department for Tonos, confirmed for me that he did tape the writing sessions. He also revealed that that Foster, his father-in-law and not Michael Jackson, wrote the music for the song with one of his associates.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jackson had nothing to do with it,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cut to the other day, when a friend told Kipp he&#39;d read about Jackson&#39;s new charity single called &quot;I Have This Dream.&quot; If it&#39;s ever released, the single is intended to help the people of the Gulf Coast, even though the hurricane is now almost five months in the past and other artists have already put out their own singles.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ironies abound here: Kipp told me when I spoke to him that he&#39;s originally from New Orleans and that his family home was wiped out by Katrina, so his relatives might benefit from any money raised by charity singles.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately for Kipp, the &quot;dream&quot; in the title has become a nightmare. At first he thought winning the contest would be a breakthrough for him in the music industry. Back in 2002, when he won the contest, he thought he&#39;d made it at last. Instead, the roller coaster ride that ensued more or less undid him.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Rich people don&#39;t realize what something like this does to you,&quot; he told me. &quot;It was like the boy who cried wolf. We thought everything was going to come from this.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Alas, things turned out quite differently. &quot;We were promised everything and got nothing,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, of course, there&#39;s a problem. Jackson&#39;s publicist Raymone K. Bain told me: &quot;Kipp won the contest but his lyrics weren&#39;t deemed worthy of a song sung by Michael Jackson. Carole told me she rewrote them.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bayer-Sager says that Kipp&#39;s lyrics were simply not good enough, and that in the end she, Foster and Jackson rewrote them.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was always understood that Michael wouldn&#39;t record the song if it wasn&#39;t up to our standards,&quot; she said.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">That this philosophy undermines the whole reason for having a contest and selecting a winner was a subject she didn&#39;t broach.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">What does seem to have happened, from reading over lyric sheets that Kipp sent me, is that he won with one set of lyrics, then Foster and Bayer-Sager began massaging them. Eventually, a finished song was produced, with a combination of lyrics. But in the intervening time, Kipp&#39;s contribution was cut to nil, and now nearly nothing remains of his work.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/50611/michael-sings-for-katrina-relief"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;E!&rdquo; (September 6, 2005)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190827172600/https://www.eonline.com/news/50611/michael-sings-for-katrina-relief"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson is ready for action.</span></p><p class="cs3F1B7DBA"><span class="csD5D7D290">The entertainer, who&#39;s been enjoying a lengthy vacation in the United Arab Emigrates, has announced plans to record a song to benefit victims of Hurricane Katrina.

It showed screaming fans mobbing the star as he arrived, then Jackson singing a few lines from &quot;I&#39;m Into Something Good&quot; and &quot;Ferry &#39;Cross The Mersey&quot; before trying a couple of lines from &quot;I Have This Dream&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-052-michael-prince-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 52 (March 19, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What were Michael&#39;s plans post-Sony-dispute?

Was there any discussion about what he was gonna be doing, if it weren&#39;t for the trial?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes and yes... We never stopped working on songs. I mean, jumping ahead a little bit, even when Michael was in Bahrain, he was working on songs over there with [John Barnes]... but he was also calling Brad, and working on ideas. They were working on something for--I want to say Hurricane Katrina or something like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was it John Barnes?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, yeah. And I&#39;ve had several meetings over the last 5, 6 years with John Barnes, nicest guy in the world. And in a lot of ways, he was sort of Brad before there was a Brad, you know what I mean? So Michael would work on new ideas with John Barnes, and, at some point, I think he--Brad Buxer and Michael just kind of gelled and Brad could be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I think Michael really liked that. And then Brad sort of became the go-to guy for collaborating on new songs. So even when Michael was working with John Barnes, he was calling Brad, giving him ideas--and there were several songs--but the one I remember the most--it was gonna be for the Hurricane Katrina victims, and I can&#39;t remember what the name of the darn thing was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was it &quot;From the Bottom of My Heart&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It might have been.
