We recorded all those vocals at the Bel Air Hotel. Once we got to the Carolwood house, we were just sort of working on new music with &quot;Neff U&quot; and I don&#39;t believe we did a lead vocal at all. We did a few vocal effects and things like that, but Michael never really sang at the Carolwood house. So that was one of the last, if not the last, one or two songs that he actually sang on, for sure, &quot;Best of Joy&quot;. And &quot;Best of Joy&quot; was one of those songs that was pulled from the tape vault, I had never heard of it before. Michael just—Michael had a memory for songs that he had worked on, but also songs, almost anything that had been a hit in the last 30 years, Michael knew it, and could sing it to you, right off the bat. And he said to me one day, he goes, &quot;We need to call the vault and get a copy of &#39;Best of Joy&#39;&quot;. I went—I had never heard the title in my life—I went, &quot;Ok&quot;. So this is like late summer 2008, and we&#39;re already in L.A. and I have the song transferred digitally into Pro Tools, and picked up the hard drive, and we set up the mike, and Michael resang that. Now, I didn&#39;t know this at the time, and that&#39;s one of the songs where he sort of had Ron Feemster sort of redo the music to, and I spoke to Brad about this &nbsp;a year and a half ago, and I said, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know who the original [musician is]. It&#39;s just a drum machine, and a Fender Rose&quot; and Brad goes, &quot;I did that.&quot; And I went, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know that&quot;. &#39;Cause when you get a hard drive, there&#39;s no documentation, it&#39;s just a bunch of tracks, and you have to figure out what&#39;s what. So I thought that was interesting. So there was another sort of thing that Brad and MJ had worked on that I wasn&#39;t even aware of. It might have been pre-1997 truthfully, I&#39;m not really sure—the original music, I mean, the original idea.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it certainly went on to become something really beautiful. His final vocal, you said earlier, was recorded in a hotel, I think you said?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, in the bathroom of his suite at the Bel Air Hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
