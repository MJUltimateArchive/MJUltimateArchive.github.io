And Brad was walking around, and I think this might have been in Vegas in a hotel, but I&#39;m not sure. And he was saying out loud, &quot;I&#39;m a loser, I&#39;m a loser&quot;, and he was getting mad at--he was worked up. He was just really upset, and he kept saying, &quot;I&#39;m a loser, I&#39;m a loser&quot;, and then Michael knocked on the door and said, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; and then Brad told him the story, and that&#39;s how that song was born. And the original title was called &quot;I am a Loser&quot;. And it was that for a long time, we worked on it mostly up at the ranch, and then the funny thing is--or an interesting thing is--in 2008, I was working with Michael on music and on vocals, and it was just the two of us, and we were at the Bel Air Hotel, and Michael, unbeknownst to me, was in L.A.. That&#39;s when he was having all the meetings with AEG. But I did not know that, and it wasn&#39;t any of my business, so I&#39;m just working on music, and then Michael looks at me one day, and goes, &quot;I need to re-sing the chorus on this song&quot;. I go, &quot;Why?&rdquo; And he goes, &quot;Well, I love the song. But I don&#39;t want people to think I </span><span class="cs43C038A">am </span><span class="csD5D7D290">a loser. It&#39;s okay if I </span><span class="cs43C038A">was </span><span class="csD5D7D290">a loser, and I&#39;m not anymore&quot;. And I go, &quot;Okay. That makes sense.&quot; So we have a newer version of that song called, &quot;I Was the Loser&quot;. And, of course, I have both of them on the hard drive, but if Michael--if we were to release a version right now, the one that would make Michael happy was &quot;I Was the Loser&quot;, not &quot;I Am a Loser&quot;, so it&#39;s the same song, he just re-sang the chorus.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Damien Shields, author, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.damienshields.com/i-am-a-loser-exclusive/"><span class="cs8567212B">DamienShields.com (September 8, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190321113045/http://www.damienshields.com/i-am-a-loser-exclusive/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The mystique that surrounded Michael Jackson&rsquo;s unreleased song &ldquo;I Am A Loser&rdquo; was finally put to rest today after a fan leaked the full track online. However, although fans can now enjoy the track in all its glory, there is still much confusion regarding the true origins of the song. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson fans have long speculated that the track was written and recorded in the late 90s &ndash; prior to the release of Jackson&rsquo;s 2001 &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; album. However, this information has proven to be inaccurate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I Am A Loser&rdquo; was first conceived more than a year </span><span class="cs43C038A">after</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> the release of &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo;, in January of 2003, shortly after wrapping up the last of a series of interviews for Martin Bashir&rsquo;s ill-fated &ldquo;Living With Michael Jackson&rdquo; documentary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson and his long-time collaborator Brad Buxer, who is responsible for contributions towards a plethora of tracks including &ldquo;Who Is It&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stranger In Moscow&rdquo;, were staying in adjoining hotel rooms at the time while working on music together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buxer, who was going through a breakup at the time, was awake late one night. Upset about the breakup, he was pacing around his room repeating, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a loser! I&rsquo;m just a loser!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before long Jackson, who could hear Buxer through the wall, knocked on his door and came in and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m a loser&hellip;&rdquo; answered Buxer, before explaining his situation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s write a song about it,&rdquo; suggested Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And so Jackson and Buxer got to work, co-writing and composing the track &ldquo;I Am A Loser&rdquo; into the early hours of the morning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We had our typical recording setup,&rdquo; explains the pair&rsquo;s engineer/producer, Michael Prince. &ldquo;ProTools, keyboards, a microphone set up with headphones &ndash; the whole thing. So it&rsquo;s basically a mini recording studio.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Brad was playing keys and Michael was doing a scratch vocal. It happened very fast,&rdquo; recalls Prince, who began working on the song soon after the first scratch vocal had been laid down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael did multiple performances to get a good demo down,&rdquo; tells Prince. &ldquo;We worked on it further at the ranch &nbsp;(Neverland) and at other times in other places, too. Michael likes to keep polishing things. He was always asking for a new sound here or a new hi-hat there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song is built around trademark Jackson/Buxer drum loops and beatbox sounds in the vein of &ldquo;Stranger in Moscow&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beautiful Girl&rdquo;, and backed by soothing synths and an angelic harp. Jackson tells Buxer&rsquo;s true story of a love lost with poignant lyrics; &ldquo;I say hello/You say goodbye. I reach to you/You don&rsquo;t even try. I am a loser. I am a loser.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Upon reviewing what was leaked today, Prince can confirm it is </span><span class="cs43C038A">not</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> the most recent version of the track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I mean the leaked version is vocally complete, but you can tell it&rsquo;s the demo because after the second or third chorus you hear Michael go &lsquo;Ahh&rsquo; like that, because he was getting ready to sing a part and then he stopped,&rdquo; explains Prince. &ldquo;Nobody has edited that. He didn&rsquo;t mean for that to be left on the record. Just like on [the unreleased track] &ldquo;Gloucestershire&rdquo; &ndash; Michael starts doing a little horn part with his voice, just so he wouldn&rsquo;t forget it &ndash; because it&rsquo;s a scratch vocal track.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The version that leaked is pretty much the finished demo from before it became &lsquo;I Was The Loser&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re hearing is Michael singing and Brad playing. That truly is the demo. Those vocals are untouched, un-tuned and unedited,&rdquo; says Prince.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was happy with the original &lsquo;I Am A Loser&rsquo; demo,&rdquo; adds Prince. &ldquo;But before we played it for anybody else we had a long talk and Michael said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want be a loser. I don&rsquo;t mind if I </span><span class="cs43C038A">was</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> the loser but I don&rsquo;t want to say I&rsquo;m still a loser.&rsquo; So we changed that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I Was The Loser&rdquo; is the final version of the track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson did not record the whole song again when it changed from &ldquo;I </span><span class="cs43C038A">Am</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> A Loser&rdquo; to &ldquo;I </span><span class="cs43C038A">Was</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The Loser&rdquo;. He simply re-recorded that particular line, while the musical composition remained exactly the same.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The recording of the &ldquo;I was the loser&rdquo; line took place in a makeshift studio set up by Prince at Jackson&rsquo;s Bel Air Hotel room in late 2008 &ndash; the same period of time in which the King of Pop laid down additional vocals for other pre-existing tracks including &ldquo;Best of Joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hollywood Tonight&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">These, among many others, were tracks Jackson had on &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list at the time of his death on June 25, 2009. A handwritten note detailing the titles of 28 tracks Jackson had hoped to completed, including &ldquo;The Loser&rdquo; as Jackson called it, was found beside his bed following his passing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There are things that just stuck in his mind,&rdquo; says Prince. &ldquo;Sometimes he writes new songs, and sometimes he wants to bring up something from the past that he knows is an unpolished gem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I remember we did a little work on &lsquo;Scared Of The Moon&rsquo; for the &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; album, actually. And I remember Steve Porcaro joking, &lsquo;Oh that song again?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s so funny because I&rsquo;d never heard it before. But that&rsquo;s Michael&rsquo;s way of doing things &ndash; he always revisited some of his favourite stuff. He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we put this on our last album? Let&rsquo;s listen again. Can we make it any better?&rsquo; Sometimes it makes it on the album and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Both &ldquo;I Am A Loser&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Was The Loser&rdquo; remain unreleased in an official capacity to this day.</span></p></body>
