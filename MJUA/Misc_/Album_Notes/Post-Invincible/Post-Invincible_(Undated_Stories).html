Big directors, big producers, people that he had known for years, or friends of people that he knew. And we would be in the dance studio, we had all the equipment set up, working on a new song, and Michael would come in there with them. And he&#39;d go, &quot;Oh, this is--&quot; I don&#39;t remember anybody&#39;s name, but he did. And he mentioned three big, giant films, and I&#39;m going like, &quot;Wow. What&#39;s this guy doing here?&quot; But Michael knew everybody. And Michael made it a point to tell Brad and myself, and I&#39;m sure he told others, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear any more talk about touring&quot;. He wanted to either act or produce or direct or do music for film. In fact, Michael and Brad wrote about--oh gosh, five or six different, little things, hoping to get it into the movie called &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. I don&#39;t think they ever made it into the movie. They were working on a lot of different things, and Michael really--and I think this really speaks to the fact that, here is somebody who has now been touring on and off for, at least 40 years, 38 years, quite a few years, and he really wanted to, somehow, break into the movie business. And he didn&#39;t really care so much if he was an actor or a director, but he felt he had learned enough, and was a real student of film, as he was with music, to be able to be given the reins, and direct and/or produce a full-fledged motion picture. And I think that&#39;s why some of these gentlemen were coming up to the ranch, is Michael was talking to them in earnest about trying to do that. And I think a lot of it was just knowing how much of a stress touring put on him physically, and that he would loved to have just--I think been a big director/actor for the rest of his life, and it just didn&#39;t happen the way he wanted. He was really hoping--and I don&#39;t know if many people know this--he really tried to get that Johnny Depp role in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory or something like that. And he was also hoping to get that role in that movie &quot;Powder&quot;, which I think he would have been great in, but the thing is is when you&#39;re Michael Jackson and you&#39;re so well known as being Michael Jackson, one of the world&#39;s greatest singers and dancers, it&#39;s hard--I mean, Hollywood, the industry, really typecasts you. Just like they do if you&#39;re a TV actor that does comedies, nobody&#39;s gonna hire you for a drama. If you&#39;re a TV actor, nobody wants you to do movies. If you write music for television, nobody really wants to give you a chance to write music for film, because it&#39;s a &quot;different thing&quot;, and it&#39;s not. It&#39;s all these little clubs, and everybody--well, that&#39;s just how the music business is, and that&#39;s how the film business is, and the TV business. I mean, once you&#39;re something, they figure, &quot;Well you can&#39;t be that and that&quot;. And some of the biggest stars have proven that that&#39;s not true, you can have a TV career and a film career, and you can actually have a TV career, and have a band and have some hit songs and go on tour and have a lot of fun, like Rick Springfield. He made it clear that he didn&#39;t want us [laughs] to bring up the word &quot;tour&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Were you involved in any sessions with Michael around [the 2004-2005 trial] period?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We were up at the ranch--Brad and I--in two separate rooms, two separate studios setup, and we were working on thing up until about 2 weeks before the trial. And I think this was a mistake on the attorney&#39;s part, because they told Michael&#39;s brother Randy and [Eddie] that they thought this music was a distraction and they wanted Michael&#39;s full attention in preparing for the trial, so they said, &quot;Ok, you guys need to pack up your stuff and head back to your studios at your houses&quot;, which we did. And still kept in touch with Michael, but I think it would&#39;ve been much better had we at least kept one of the writing systems up there so that Michael would have this release, because for him that was like meditation, it was his yoga, it was what gave him an artistic release, and I think that would have been very, very good for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How do you feel about these songs sort of slowly leaking...?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it&#39;s my general understanding that the reason or the way these songs got leaked is--at some point, we turned them all over to the Estate and the Estate turned them over to Sony, and Sony had them on their server. And somebody got into Sony&#39;s server, and they didn&#39;t just get Michael&#39;s stuff, they got other stuff, but it hurts to know that it&#39;s been released, just knowing that it hasn&#39;t been properly mixed. Bruce Swedien is still alive, it&#39;s something that--I&#39;ve mentioned it to people at the Estate before, but it hasn&#39;t really gone anywhere, where I would love for Brad and I to, at least, musically, finish these--Brad still has notes on what Michael wanted done on the songs, and touch &#39;em up a little bit, and then--but not do what they&#39;ve been doing on his last two records--and get the producer of the moment and have them do all-new music. That to me is sacrilegious. If it has an MJA on it, that means Michael loved it the way it was, but we knew it wasn&#39;t mixed, like by Bruce, or I could even mix them, but I think--especially since Bruce is so connected to all of Michael&#39;s biggest hits, while we still have that amazing genius on the planet, I would say, &quot;Michael Prince, put those songs on a hard drive and fly to Florida, and spend a month there with Bruce and get Bruce to do a final mix on these songs. And then put those out there for the fans, because I don&#39;t want to hear those songs with somebody else&#39;s idea of what drum loop Michael might&#39;ve liked on there, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Corey Rooney, the original writer/producer of &quot;She Was Lovin&#39; Me&quot;, isn&#39;t happy with the final mix [on the Xscape album]. He didn&#39;t even get asked to mix that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yup. All I can say is, it&#39;s another example of somebody making bad decisions, because if you are gonna release the original version--or call it the &quot;demo version&quot;, or whatever you wanna call it--why wouldn&#39;t you talk to the person that was actually working on it with Michael and say, &quot;Which one do you think was the furthest one along?&quot; or &quot;Which one did Michael seem the happiest with?&quot;. I think either Sony or the Estate just went to the vault and sort of said, &quot;Now here&#39;s a version&quot; and they don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the latest version or it&#39;s the middle version--I don&#39;t think they really know that--but, yeah, I&#39;m aware of that. I know with the two Dr. Freeze&#39;s song, nobody called him. And that&#39;s not really how you really want to find out, &quot;What was the boss thinking? What was the boss&#39; favorite version?&quot; That&#39;s about all I want to say about that. But I do commend L.A. Reid for having that bonus album with, at least the attempt at putting the original, unadulterated, un-modernized version on there, just because it sort of shows you where the song was when Michael left. It might have been a different time, it might have been a slightly different sound, but it&#39;s still something that came out of his mind and the mind of whoever he wrote it with. So I had a meeting with L.A. Reid actually six months before the record came out and he told me he was gonna do that, and I thanked him for that, not knowing what versions he was gonna pick, &#39;cause it didn&#39;t really matter to me, but I said, &quot;That&#39;s really what the fans want. They probably want that more than so-and-so&#39;s version of it.&quot; So I&#39;m glad he did that, I wish they would&#39;ve done that on the &quot;Michael&quot; album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Blue Gangsta is a great example of what you&#39;re talking about. The version that&#39;s come out of that song on the second disc of the &quot;Xscape&quot; album isn&#39;t the finished version. There was a leak years earlier of that with percussive elements, that I think yourself and Brad worked on, that take the song to a whole new level, and I didn&#39;t know why that version didn&#39;t come out on the &quot;Xscape&quot; album...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I think, just because, the people that worked on the album didn&#39;t take the time to ask the people that worked on the songs which one Michael would have liked, or which ones they felt was the best. Like, why wouldn&#39;t you ask Freeze, &quot;Hey, which version were you and Michael the happiest with?&quot;, and just go with it. I think sometimes people up in ivory towers tend to do things in a bit of a bubble.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So no plans for any new music during the show, is that right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You know what, I think what was gonna happen is, once we got this much learned, Michael told me that once we got to the UK, we were gonna--as soon as we started rehearsing, we stopped working on all new material. I had been going to his house and working with Michael, some days with a guy named Ron Feemster, also known as &quot;Neff U&quot; on new stuff... But some of the stuff &quot;Neff U&quot; was working on was just rehashing some of the stuff that Brad and Michael had worked on, just with different piano sounds or different drum sounds, so not all of them were like new, new stuff, but we did have some new stuff. Probably have 20 titles on a hard drive of stuff that Michael and &quot;Neff U&quot; were working on. And then Michael said once we got to the UK and got settled in, I was gonna bring all my gear over to his house, and on our days off, and when he had the energy and I did, then we were gonna continue working on new songs. And this is something that, when he first said it to me, I thought, &quot;What is he talking about? And then I realized within about two minutes that it was genius. He goes, &quot;I&#39;m not gonna release albums anymore. We&#39;re just gonna put out a single every couple of months.&quot; Because we all come from the land of albums, you know what I mean? So at first, when he said that, I thought, &quot;Why would he say that?&quot; And then, literally, within a few minutes, I realized it would solve so many things. A) You&#39;re already touring, so you&#39;ve got this buzz going on because you&#39;re playing--and it wasn&#39;t just gonna be London, it was gonna be all over the world--and you release a single, so you&#39;re only trying to sell one song. It&#39;s a whole new world now, and he realized that. It was all digital, it can be a worldwide release [with] the stroke of a pen. And then what he could do is, after you do about eight or ten singles over the period, of course, of, let&#39;s say, a year. You do two new songs, and repackage it as an album. And I think that was genius, I really do, now that I think about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What were some of his favorite titles that he had mentioned he would&#39;ve worked on?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, there&#39;s a famous yellow sheet of paper with his handwriting and the pictures were taken or obtained by TMZ that were in his bedroom and it was on the wall in his bedroom. And I don&#39;t know if I have that picture in front of me... If you&#39;ve seen that, that, I think, was, in his mind, the list of his ten, twelve, fourteen--I don&#39;t remember how many were on there--most important songs. And the interesting thing is, none of those songs were from the Cascio collection, which I find interesting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csE372B9B3">I mean, you had so many songs that Michael had started, Michael and Brad had started, Michael and &quot;Neff U&quot; had started, Michael and Rodney had started, and then you&#39;ve got the few that came from... Carole Bayer Sager.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">MJCast:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> Yeah, she did &quot;We&#39;ve Had Enough&quot;, I think.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">Prince:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> Yeah, and then, of course, Teddy [Riley]. I&#39;m not really sure what Teddy wrote that made it onto the album... (&quot;2000 Watts&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Whatever Happens&quot;) but there were so many songs that got pushed to the wayside just because newer stuff just kept coming in all the time. So once you sort of passed on a song, you didn&#39;t work on it anymore. But that list, that yellow piece of paper, if anybody has that anywhere&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csE372B9B3">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">MJCast:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> I understand you were involved in some way [with the planned, but ultimately cancelled, 2008 Grammy Awards appearance], perhaps in putting together the music. I just wanted what recollections you have about that performance, what it was gonna be, and why it never came to be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">Prince:</span><span class="csE372B9B3">...I don&#39;t think I worked on anything for the Grammys, Lavelle was up there in 2008 before I came up there. I want to say I came up in May or June of that year, which would have been way after the Grammys. In earlier 2008, I wanna say &quot;Neff U&quot; was going up there and back, Michael was doing a little bit of work at the recording studio at the Palms Hotel, and I know Brad was up there quite a bit in 2007, and I&#39;m trying to think when--the last time I was up there with Brad, I didn&#39;t get up there &#39;til, I want to say, the middle of 2008. And it was an interesting time, because Michael had Lavelle staying in one hotel, and he had &quot;Neff U&quot; and I staying in a different hotel, and we would usually go on different days. So, even though I had known Lavelle for a long time, I hardly ever saw him. So every once in a while, I would just call him, and some days none of us had to work, so I would go to his hotel, and we would just have dinner or something like that, and then I&#39;d go back to my hotel. But Lavelle went--we call them, there are &quot;dance days&quot; and &quot;music days&quot;, so Lavelle would go on &quot;dance days&quot;... and either I, or &quot;Neff U&quot; and I, sometimes just &quot;Neff U&quot;, would go on &quot;music days&quot;. And it was interesting because we worked throughout the summer, on and off. And then we were there one day, working on new stuff, and went to the hotel, and we&#39;re planning on coming back at, let&#39;s say, ten in the morning, or something like that. And we&#39;re at the hotel, and we get a call, going, &quot;Ok, we&#39;re going to Los Angeles tomorrow&quot;. And I went, &quot;We&#39;re going to Los Angeles tomorrow?&quot; Then he goes, &quot;Yeah. So, in the morning, we&#39;ll send a vehicle for you, just come over here and get the stuff that you really, absolutely have to have, and then [we&#39;re] gonna start working in Los Angeles for a while.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csE372B9B3">&quot;Ok&quot;. And I thought they meant we&#39;re going to Los Angeles for a week. Well, we never went back to Las Vegas. That&#39;s when Michael was starting, unbeknownst to any of us, these talks with AEG. That&#39;s when he moved first to the Bel Air Hotel. So the next time I see him, &quot;Neff U&quot; calls me and he goes, &quot;Hey, Michael wants us to come to his place at the Bel Air Hotel.&quot; I went, &quot;Ok&quot;. So we set up our whole little thing in there, and then Michael would tell me, he goes, &quot;I&#39;m not moving here. I&#39;m only here for business reasons&quot;. I still didn&#39;t know what was going on, because I don&#39;t pry. If Michael wants to tell me something, he can tell me, but I&#39;m not gonna pressure him. That just isn&#39;t our relationship... It was shortly after that when he starts mentioning AEG and stuff like that... But I did not work on anything for the Grammys in 2008.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">MJCast:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> Did Michael ever talk to you about the tracks he was working on with will.i.am?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">Prince:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> No. Anybody that&#39;s worked with Michael long enough--not just work, but sorta become his friend, realizes Michael really liked to compartmentalize his life. In other words, he didn&#39;t want Lavelle and I coming, normally, on the same day unless he needed me to work with Lavelle, which I did a lot of times on coming out with--slicing and dicing songs up so they&#39;d fit like a dance routine better or something like that. And so he wouldn&#39;t, necessarily have ever talked to me about who else he was writing with, because those were all like separate little shelves on his big bookcase, and they weren&#39;t supposed to really intertwine. And it wasn&#39;t always just music, it was other things too. But I remember one day, we were at the Bel Air Hotel, and we were getting four or maybe five songs ready to play for Rod Temperton. And Rod was gonna come over to Michael&#39;s suite around 5:00. Well, I was supposed to be gone before 5:00, right? And so that shows you the picture, like there&#39;s nothing wrong with me being there. I know Rod, I&#39;ve worked with Rod on other projects, just that Rod was working on and stuff. And so I remember it took longer than we wanted it to, to get these songs ready, and I actually gave Michael a little lesson how to play them in Pro Tools, &#39;cause I had &#39;em all in Pro Tools, you could just hit play, click on the name of the song, hit play, so he was playing with that. And everything took a little bit longer just to really show him, and make sure it was all dialed in and sounding perfect, and then all of a sudden--&#39;cause Rod is this English guy who&#39;s always early--and so, ten &#39;til 5:00, I was three minutes away from being ready to leave, and all of a sudden, this [knock-knock-knock] at the door... And then Michael looks at me, like wide-eyed, and he goes over and he looks out the little peep-hole through the door, and he looks back at me, and he goes, &quot;It&#39;s Rod!&quot; and I&#39;m going like, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s supposed to be coming over around now.&quot; He goes, &quot;What do we do?&quot;, and I go, &quot;How about I get up, and I walk over to the door, and you open it, and I shake his hand, and I leave and go out to my car.&quot; He goes, &quot;Ok&quot;. Because he didn&#39;t want me to see Rod, and he didn&#39;t want Rod to see me. For not a reason like anything antagonistic or evil, it was just, &quot;I&#39;m done with Michael Prince, he&#39;s got me all ready to meet with Rod, now I&#39;m meeting Rod&quot;, you know?... In a way, it was very humorous to me, but insightful at the same time&hellip;</span></p></body>
