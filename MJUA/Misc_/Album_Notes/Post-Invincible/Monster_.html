I&#39;d love for you to take us through the journey of &quot;Monster&quot; and what you did on it, and Michael&#39;s vision for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">When I got to it, it was pretty involved. It was already over a hundred tracks, and I was at Record One, and we recorded vocals on it. So I made a work reel. So basically, we were in the room that had--I don&#39;t know, it had like 102 input SSL, and we needed that actually. I had two Sony machines that were full, so that was 96 tracks. So the orchestra--there was an orchestra laid out, huge amount of percussion, there was flies buzzing, there was--it was very experimental, it sounded like a very personal Michael Jackson song to me, very personal. And it--I would say, and I use this analogy often, but it&#39;s not exactly inaccurate, but it&#39;s very much--I kinda took it like--kinda one of his Sgt. Pepper songs. That he went kind of art instead of trying to hit us over the pop noggin, like he&#39;s great at doing. He reached down into some kind of a different place for this song. I guess more challenging to listen to would be the best way to put it. So it was very interesting. So I had to take all those tracks, I did a mix, he was coming into the studio occasionally, but then I had a long two-day period where I didn&#39;t see him, and I was at Record One, so I mixed up, for as long as I could, and then made a work reel, which means I took those 96 tracks and I got a third Sony machine, locked all three up, and I put eight tracks down to the work track. So I had two tracks of drums on it, two tracks of effect, two tracks of keyboards, two tracks of percussion. And then that released 40 channels. So then that was our vocal reel. So after I made that, Michael would come into the studio and would sing on &quot;Monster&quot;. I guess &quot;Monster&quot;&#39;s the name of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">The hook I recorded, he sang &quot;You created a monster&quot;, was the hook that he sang.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That&#39;s right, yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">So maybe that&#39;s the title. Maybe it was just &quot;Monster&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> On that note, I&#39;ve heard this song before; I don&#39;t know what sort of state of completion I&#39;ve heard it in, but the accounts are right. It sounds, instrumentally, probably, in my opinion, the most complex Michael instrumental I&#39;ve ever heard. There is so much going on, it&#39;s incredible. But the vocal I&#39;ve heard--the version I&#39;ve heard--there is only the hook you described in the chorus. There&#39;s no other vocal. Did you record any other Michael vocal for that song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar:</span><span class="csD5D7D290">... Now, I definitely recall the hook, &#39;cause you get a huge stack. We did a lot of stacks. Then we did--yeah, we--I remember filling a lot of stuff. Now, we did a lot of experimented vocals, he may have sung some verses. I don&#39;t know if they were experimental to him. I don&#39;t know--let me put it this way... I recall almost filling that reel, 40 tracks. Now, was it with verses and a bridge? I don&#39;t know. Maybe had some skeletal ideas of that, but I know we practically filled it... I actually had a problem. He&#39;s so fast that he remembers where he is in tracks and stuff, and he wants to go back and he wants to record an idea, and then he wants to go to this section of tape and record an idea, and then he wants to go here. Now, we&#39;re on tape, so this is when I made the money. I was paid right, you know? Because what made that difficult is that we weren&#39;t in Pro Tools, so you can&#39;t see the audio about to come up. You don&#39;t get to see audio, it&#39;s only tape and needles bouncing. So he would ask me, &quot;Oh, there&#39;s a section of tape here, I want to record something&quot;. Well, right after that, is the bridge. So I have to be careful to take it out of record when he sings on a section that has something after it. So the vocal session was--after about a week--was getting complicated. There [were] parts flying around all over this reel, including the hook that you mentioned, and I remember he was singing something, and I can see a note I wrote, &#39;cause I was furiously writing notes, &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t keep up with Michael. It&#39;s like--I also had to keep </span><span class="cs43C038A">him</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> from making a mistake... It&#39;s part of my job, too, is to help him not screw up, you know? So he was singing, and we were coming up to a part that I was about to record over. So I was, like, I was--had a catch-22. I had to drop out. So I had to drop out in the middle of a vocal. And so I dropped out, and he goes, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh my God, Michael Jackson&#39;s yelling at me, first of all&quot; [laughs] And I&#39;m going, &quot;Michael, Michael. The beatbox was right on that--it was right after&quot;. He goes, &quot;[sigh of relief] Ohh, thanks for dropping me out&quot;. I was like, &quot;Oh my gosh&quot;. I was like, &quot;Dude&quot;, you know? And so, by that story alone, that meant we were cramming the tape. So, I have to say, there was a lot of stuff. In the rough mix you heard--I mean, maybe the vocal session I had with him--it&#39;s hard to say, I did that in &#39;99.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did Michael ever talk to you about the song &quot;Monster&quot; and his vision for it, and where he wanted it to go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">No. No, he did--he liked my mix a lot. He liked it so much that he made me put it to a half-inch analog machine, which I thought was kinda funny. He just loved it in his headphones so much. I had two days to work on it, so I wanted to give him a mix in his headphones to sing against, that he would enjoy, so I really made something that&#39;d be fun to sing against, and, evidently, he responded to it. So he liked it enough to print it, so maybe that&#39;s what people are hearing. And I may have done it with just the hook in it, I don&#39;t know. &#39;Cause I did some rough mix versions for him, so he could take it home and maybe sing in the car, or whatever, so Michael probably had 30 versions of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So did he ever have any expert advice that he gave you, or do you have anything that you might have learned from him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">He--no, he was never direct like that. We talked about like--I was interested in anthropology and science, and things like that, so I would read the paper, or things like that. I would chat with him about things that I was interested in that maybe--&#39;cause sometimes he was really just sort of quiet a lot of the time. But little things that happened would be like--he would mess with me a little bit. When we were working on &ldquo;Monster&rdquo;, at that point, he was driving himself down to the studio with Prince, with his little boy. And he was driving this kind of a blacked-out Dodge Ram truck, it was bright red. It was totally tinted out, and that&#39;s what--Michael was open-bed truck, and that&#39;s what Michael was driving to the studio. And he would just put Prince in a seat next to him, and he would just walk in the studio with Prince in hand, and Prince was maybe a year old, maybe 18 months, a toddler, just wearing a diaper, fuzzy head, you know? And Michael would just walk in for a vocal session with no babysitter. So I had to put Prince on my knee with my arm around his belly, so I had his baby on my left knee, and I had my right hand on the remote for the recording. So I&#39;m recording Michael Jackson&#39;s vocals, I got a baby in my left hand, and then of course--not only that, I&#39;m recording Michael, which is hard, I mean recording him is really hard because he&#39;s fast, you don&#39;t want him to break flow, you&#39;re trying to keep his flow going, so I&#39;m huffing and puffing, the kid is squirming around. A couple times he hit the button in the middle of a vocal and cut the vocal, you know? And then Michael&#39;s like, &quot;Oh Prince, oh, you&#39;re so silly&quot;. And I&#39;m smiling, having a great time to Michael, but in my mind, I&#39;m going, &quot;Oh, God. How do I--damn baby is messing up my job!&quot; [laughs] That&#39;s how I was feeling at the time, I was getting so frustrated. But Michael knew that, and it was cracking him up. And he knew I was sweating, trying to keep up with the session, and huffing and puffing, babysitting and recording a vocal. He liked watching me go through that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That is an incredible story, just to hear--that&#39;s a very, very different Michael Jackson--the real Michael Jackson. That&#39;s a different Michael [than] sort of what the media portrayed, like a guy just driving himself down to the studio in a ute (Australian term) with his son.</span></p></body>
