He was truly upset when the song he did with Akon was leaked (Hold My Hand)... We would sit there and just be talking, and he would just get this sad look on his face, like how could this happen? Because 20 years ago, this would not have happened. And he--the song wasn&#39;t done, it wasn&#39;t to his liking yet, and somehow everybody in the world has a copy of it, and that really upset him &#39;cause he liked that song a lot. And I think that really changed his overall view of the big picture on when he should and shouldn&#39;t sing. I think that made him, pushed him, not wanting to put his voice on a song until it was for a record, and they were getting ready to really go for it, because he realized even a demo with his voice on it, if it got in the wrong hands, could end up on the Internet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I can only imagine what [the 2003 &quot;Xscape&quot; leak and 2008 &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; leak] would do to the mind of a perfectionist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, and it&#39;s like--I talked to an engineer friend of mine, and he had flown over to Ireland several times with Rodney...

I think he just--he knew that once his vocal was on there, if somebody put it out, he had completely lost control of that song. And as long it was an instrumental, it was worthless.</span></p></body>
