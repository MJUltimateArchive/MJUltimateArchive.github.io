I have it, it says &quot;Get Your Weight Off Me&quot;, it says &quot;Michael Jackson&quot;, it&#39;s 5 minutes and 17 seconds long [*plays the song, censored in podcast*] Well, the date on it is 6/20/04. &quot;Weight Off of Me&quot;, 85 bpm, studio [unintelligible], somebody was figuring out delays and stuff for it. So yeah, like I said, I like it, and I&#39;ve never heard it before... It&#39;s in the same folder with the original &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Craze&quot;, I don&#39;t know what &quot;Craze&quot; is, I&#39;ll have to listen to that one day. I got stuff- &quot;A Place with No Name&quot;&#39;s in here, &quot;Don&#39;t Be Messin&#39;&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Tonight&quot;, &quot;In the Back&quot;, &quot;Fall Again&quot;, I got some songs I need to listen to at some point. Again, I&#39;ve probably heard it before, but...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&#39;s amazingly interesting is that song you just played, &quot;Can&#39;t Get Your Weight Off Me&quot;, to me, sounded like a very complete production and vocal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. I&#39;m surprised that song hasn&#39;t come out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That sounds, to me, as strong as &quot;Xscape&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve Had Enough&quot; and like--it just goes back to that old story, the best songs from Invincible sort of not coming out on Invincible, in some cases.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Agreed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Wow, that is--I literally--that sounds incredible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I have my earphones in, so I didn&#39;t hear it that well, but I could hear enough of it to sound like--that sounds like a really good vocal and a really good song... I kinda wonder how I got it. I know I had a couple hard drives at the end of Invincible that pretty much had everything on there, but this wasn&#39;t a final mix or a mix stem or anything. So it&#39;s kinda interesting... I can&#39;t believe this song wasn&#39;t put on one of the last two records... They don&#39;t want to give you everything at once, so if they thought this song had some--and I&#39;d have to listen to the whole thing to really see, does it go somewhere? You know what I mean? Because Michael likes songs that kept building as they went. And maybe the song wasn&#39;t completely developed. I wonder what &quot;Craze&quot; is. What&#39;s &quot;Craze&quot;? I&#39;m not going to listen to it, but... It says &quot;Michael Jackson&quot;. It says it&#39;s six minutes long. Hm, I&#39;ll have to check that one out.</span></p></body>
