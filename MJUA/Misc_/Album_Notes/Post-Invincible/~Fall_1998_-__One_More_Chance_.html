Kelly. had written for the project. Kelly, who contributed &lsquo;You Are Not Alone&rsquo; to HIStory, submitted at least two tracks, including the R&amp;B ballads &lsquo;Cry&rsquo; and &lsquo;One More Chance&rsquo;. The former, which highlights problems with the planet, became one of the earliest songs fully completed for the project.&rdquo; (Mike Smallcombe, &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-052-michael-prince-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 52 (March 19, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Were you involved in the recording of &quot;One More Chance&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Most of the time, R. Kelly would send the raw tracks to Brad, and then Brad and I would get them ready for MJ, and add stuff that MJ may have wanted. Now, I could be wrong, I mean, I know that song so well that I&#39;m just thinking--I don&#39;t want to not tell you the truth, so I&#39;m trying to think. I have all my notes right here now, because this main Pro Tools computer I have in my office has almost--copies of most of the stuff I worked on. Yeah, and I&#39;ve got--oh yeah, I worked on this song for a long time. I can see, going to the earliest version, was June 27, 2003... So yeah, it says &quot;One More Chance&quot; at Marvin&#39;s--that&#39;s Marvin&#39;s Place, that&#39;s the place that we did a little bit of work on the Invincible album as well. That&#39;s owned by John McClain, who&#39;s now one of the main guys at the Estate. And then we go into our numbering system, which starts with 1.1, and it goes incrementally up, so we could always go back to an older version. And we were using Pro Tools 5.1, which is a pretty old version of Pro Tools by today&#39;s standards. We&#39;re up to 12. And looks like we actually started working on the song in earnest--by July 9, we had version 1.1, and then it goes up to version &quot;13.6 MJA&quot;, which stands for &quot;Michael Jackson Approved&quot;, and I think it goes up further than that... Now we&#39;re up to July 13, of 2003, so that&#39;s actually pretty quick, and then... &quot;14.4 MJA&quot;, now we&#39;re up to July 15, that&#39;s only a couple more days, so we were going pretty fast, let&#39;s see. Let me scroll waaay down, now we&#39;re on &quot;One More Chance Vocals 2&quot;. Now we&#39;ve kinda finished the music, Michael&#39;s happy with the music, we&#39;re working on vocals. And now we&#39;re going up to--oh, it&#39;s only July 23. When you see this many things, you know we were working on this thing like 20 hours a day. July 25, July 27--I&#39;m trying to see if there is a last one. &quot;One More Chance Vocal&quot;, July 30, of 2003, and then, let&#39;s see--I&#39;ll go scroll to the bottom real quick and just see. &quot;One More Chance Vocal 33.5&quot;, July 30. Looks like we finished end of July, early [August]. Here&#39;s a &quot;One More Chance 1.5&quot; that says &quot;November 17, 2003&quot;. So when did the song come out? And yes, I worked on it [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">MJCast:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> November 20.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2F37DD57">Prince:</span><span class="csE372B9B3"> Ok.</span></p></body>
