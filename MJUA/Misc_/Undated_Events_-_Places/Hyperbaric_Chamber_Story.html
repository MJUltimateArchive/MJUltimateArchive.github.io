They quoted him as having said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken several long naps in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and when I awoke I felt like a new person &ndash; I&rsquo;ve never felt better. I definitely want one for my home so I can sleep in it at night. I plan to get one immediately. I want to live to see world peace, a world without hunger, a world where children and all mankind know no suffering. I believe if I treat my body properly I&rsquo;ll live to be at least 150.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan Margolis, journalist, &ldquo;The Mail on Sunday&rdquo; (March 2001) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.reflectionsonthedance.com/My-Friend-Michael-article.html"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160425043742/http://www.reflectionsonthedance.com/My-Friend-Michael-article.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The oxygen tent tale, Michael told me when we had Thanksgiving dinner at the Boteach home in New Jersey, stemmed from a joke he cracked to a photographer after he had crawled into one he bought for a children&#39;s hospital and emerged saying: &#39;Gee, if I had one of those, I could live to be 150.&#39; The Sun took up the gauntlet and the &#39;Wacko Jacko&#39; label, which he despises, was born.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104834/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/smash.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine (&quot;Bitz&quot; column) (1989)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Blitz: Why isn&#39;t Michael still a part of The Jacksons on your new LP? (He makes a brief appearance on the title track.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito: Well... (explains at length how Michael has been too busy touring) and it was time for the brothers to really do their thing and let the public know they have something special. I&#39;d rather have my brothers than anybody else in the world have the record for the best selling record ever, but as he says all the time to us, &#39;If anybody breaks my record I want it to be somebody in my family.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bitz: How do you feel when you read things in the papers saying he&#39;s weird or mad?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito: He doesn&#39;t talk because he&#39;ll get misquoted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie: The minute he starts saying things he&#39;s going to open a big can of worms. Like, Michael went in this tank one time and people think he sleeps in it every day! He does *not* sleep in a tank. He likes animals because that&#39;s his love for life, like some people like cars, some people like golf... Michael likes to buy animals. Michael likes art too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Bitz: Do you see Michael a lot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito: We hadn&#39;t seen him a lot in the last two years because of his tour, but since he&#39;s been off tour, we&#39;ve seen him at least twice or three times a week. Sometimes we just take ride down to the music store or maybe we&#39;ll go to the pet shop and check out the exotic animals--crazy things like that--or sometimes we&#39;ll just drive in the neighborhood and just have fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bitz: People don&#39;t really know what Michael&#39;s like. Is he normal?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito: Very much so. I feel bad for him at times because it&#39;s very hard--he&#39;d love to go to Disneyland and walk about and get on the rides and sit next to a stranger, but he can&#39;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Quincy Jones, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110034/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/anotherarticle2read.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Smash Hits&rdquo; magazine (February 18, 1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has a very curious mind, about a lot of strange things, beautiful things&quot;, says his old producer, Quincy Jones. &quot;He is an avid student of everything. He has to go and see some children at a hospital and someone says: &#39;There is an oxygen tent to sustain life.&#39; Knowing Michael, it&#39;s fascinating--and he wants to see it. He gets in it, says, &#39;I could live 15 years in this&#39;, and the story gets out. He&#39;s the most normal person in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jackie Jackson, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110034/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/anotherarticle2read.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Smash Hits&rdquo; magazine (February 18, 1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael went in this tank one day and people think he sleeps in it every day!&quot;, Jackie Jackson told &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. &quot;He does not sleep in a tank.
