The only thing the fans who gather around it ever see are the darkened windows of stretch limousines as they burst from behind the gate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inside the estate, Michael fashioned his own fantasy world, inspired by the imagination of Walt Disney. &ldquo;I went to see him about some music,&rdquo; said one songwriter, &ldquo;and while I was sitting in the living room waiting for him, I had this sensation that he was in the room somewhere, watching me. Then he came in, we talked, and he just disappeared. I looked out in the yard and he was darting in and out among these bushes and trees, chasing these little animals. He was like one of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s possible that his retreat into a childlike world saved his life. &ldquo;You have to understand that he has been mobbed,&rdquo; says McCrae. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been pulled at, had his jacket ripped off his back, had people trying to get a lock of his hair. Do you know how frightening it is to have someone coming at you, grabbing at your throat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not really happy,&rdquo; says Dennis Hunt, music critic for the Los Angeles </span><span class="cs43C038A">Times</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, who&rsquo;s known Michael for many years. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been affected by the pressures of not having any privacy. And people who know him well say it&rsquo;s finally gotten to him, and he&rsquo;s staying away from people. He&rsquo;s not dealing with the pressures the way he used to. There&rsquo;s no way that he will turn outward and live in the real world again. People thought that at some point he might outgrow it and open up, but now that&rsquo;s impossible. Because of the level of stardom that he has achieved, he is alone most of the time, except for dealing with members of his family, a few friends, and his menagerie of animals.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
