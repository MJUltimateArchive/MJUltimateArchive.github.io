If they have as good a voice as Michael and can accomplish three and a half octaves, actually three octaves and a minor six he could vocalize and with all that dancing &ndash; 21/22 songs. Full out dancing and maybe a couple of ballads and I used to vocalize him on tour three times a day: 12 &ndash; 1pm 4 &ndash; 4:30 pm and 8:15 &ndash; 8:30 pm before he went on. So if he was extravagant one afternoon I&rsquo;d put him back in and tell him where the mistakes were and tell him what and what not to do and he would go back and you know, revitalize his connection and bingo &ndash; off he&rsquo;d go.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sara Levy: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">When did you start coaching him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Riggs: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">32 years ago&hellip;. 32 years ago..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Levy:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How was your first meeting. Do you remember the first meeting?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Riggs: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah. First meeting I went &mdash; we were going to go out the front door and the carpenter said &ldquo;no, we&rsquo;re putting in new stairs so you have to go up over the roof&rdquo;, I said &ldquo;what?&rdquo; &ldquo;You have to go up on the roof&rdquo; so he gave us a ladder and we had to crawl up the ladder, walked across part of the roof and there was a couple of steps up and there was a door. So I walked over and knocked on the door and this voice says &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;is that you Michael?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, come on in.&rdquo; So I came in and there he was holding a chimpanzee by both rear feet and with a washcloth he was cleaning up his butt and put a diaper on him. That was my first meeting with Michael. (smiles)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Levy:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That&#39;s very interesting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Riggs: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">And I taught him in his bedroom all the time because he was very comfortable there and he had all of his toys and things like that around him. He had a two story bedroom and he had mannequins in there; a little girl in a tutu and a little boy in a tuxedo and they&rsquo;re leaning on the top balcony looking down at him. Pinnochio was hanging on the stairway up to the balcony and if you hit him he would bounce up and down (smiles) and I&rsquo;d be in there vocalizing Michael on the piano and the chimpanzee would hit Michael in the shoulder and then push Pinocchio who would go up and down and then he would clip me on the shoulder and Michael thought that was so funny. (Laughs) So our lessons were punctuated by animals moving in and moving out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His heart was on his sleeve (begins to cry) whenever he heard there was somebody in distress he went to rescue them. When a young boy was put in a room and set on fire by his fire by his father and was burnt very badly, Michael read about it and immediately he flew up and the young man was all bandaged in the hospital and one little hole here (motions to his mouth) and everything else was a mass of bandages and he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do, what am I going to do?&rdquo; and Michael said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll take care of you for the rest of your life.&rdquo; And he did. He always had something for that fellow to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Levy:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What is your favourite memory of Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Riggs: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">(Long pause) There were so many. Mostly they had to do with his heart. He had a great heart (begins to cry) he went everywhere when somebody was in trouble. He went and shelled out money to buy what they needed or to fix their lives. When that little boy Ryan White was given a transfusion of bad blood and got AIDS. He went and buried a young baby that was drowned because her mother threw her off because the father walked away and wouldn&rsquo;t feed her, so that baby was thrown in the river or whatever off the bridge and the little brother was thrown from the bridge and the woman jumped in. Somebody was able to get the mother and the other child but the baby was drowned. Michael read about it and he immediately went down to Long Beach and everybody was waiting for the funeral and the father came back and saw all the trouble he caused and in a way was responsible for his son&rsquo;s death or whatever someone said, &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t this funeral started?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;The person paying for it hasn&rsquo;t gotten here yet&rdquo;. About that time, up came a limo and who stepped out? Michael. Didn&rsquo;t matter where we were. We were in Liverpool and Michael read in the paper that a young person was brought up by wolves and immediately he began to cry and said, &ldquo;How terrible, we have got to get a fundraiser for that little fellow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">People constantly trying to get money out of him. He was accused by a young boy of molestation and when the trial was over &mdash; he was acquitted &mdash; and later on, the boy admitted that his father had talked him into that &ndash; talked him into saying that, and that it wasn&rsquo;t true and later the father committed suicide.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are a lot of things that people don&rsquo;t understand about Michael. He would never, never upset a child in any way. He may give them too much popcorn, too much ice cream. Up at the Ranch there were these great big things of Hagen Daz Ice Cream all over the place, out in the parking lot, in the soda fountain. I used to go out there early with no breakfast just to go to the soda fountain and have a big dish of Hagen Daz for breakfast and every year we would take all the kids and the parents up to Neverland Ranch and the parents would come over to him, I&rsquo;d be sitting there watching because I&rsquo;d been through all that &ndash; I&rsquo;ve known him for a long time. I was with him when he bought that place and they would come up with tears in their eyes and say &ldquo;where have you taken us?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken you to your childhood. I&rsquo;ve taken you to Neverland, this is where Peter Pan is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Randy Taborelli, The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Vocally, Michael was in terrific shape; his voice teacher, Seth Riggs, travelled with him for much of the [Bad] tour. &lsquo;He&#39;s a high tenor with a three-and-a-half octave range,&rsquo; Riggs said. &lsquo;He goes from basso low E up to G and A-flat above high C. A lot of people think it&#39;s a falsetto, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s all connected, which is remarkable. During his vocal exercises he would put his arms up in the air and start spinning while holding a note. I asked him why he was doing that, and he said, &ldquo;I may have to do it onstage, so I want to make sure it&#39;s possible.&rdquo; I&#39;d never seen anything like that before. I thought maybe I should stop him so he can concentrate on his voice now, and dance later. But I figured if he can do it, let him do it.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2013-09/29/content_30164298.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;China Internet Information Center&rdquo; (September 29, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140701105405/http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2013-09/29/content_30164298.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We lost a wonderful young man.

There was only one.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,950053-1,00.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Time&rdquo; magazine (March 19, 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You know, everybody thinks you&#39;re gay,&quot; Vocal Coach Seth Riggs told him one day during a break in a vocal lesson. &quot;I know,&quot; Jackson laughed. &quot;The other day a big, tall, blond, nice-looking fellow came up to me and said, &#39;Gee, Michael, I think you&#39;re wonderful. I sure would like to go to bed with you.&#39; I looked at him and said, &#39;When&#39;s the last time you read the Bible? You know you really should read it because there is some real information in there about homosexuality.&#39; The guy says, &#39;I guess if I&#39;d been a girl, it would have been different.&#39; And I said, &#39;No, there are some very direct words on that in the Bible too.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Editor&rsquo;s Note: It&rsquo;s necessary to provide full context of the above quote--Michael left the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses in 1987, and with it, the Biblical interpretation of &ldquo;homosexuality is a sin&rdquo; that his religion subscribe to; his casting of this Biblical interpretation is evidenced in <a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/paris-jackson-life-after-neverland-128510/"><span class="cs8567212B">Paris Jackson&rsquo;s 2017 interview</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> among other interviews, and friendships, where he expressed his acceptance:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;[Paris] says Michael emphasized tolerance. &ldquo;My dad raised me in a very open-minded house,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was eight years old, in love with this female on the cover of a magazine. Instead of yelling at me, like most homophobic parents, he was making fun of me, like, &lsquo;Oh, you got yourself a girlfriend.&rsquo;&rdquo;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Misunderstandings like this can be compounded by the gutter press and by the putative inside-track show-biz gossip. Jackson wants a sex-change operation; Jackson has gone under the knife for extensive plastic surgery; Jackson has been shot full of female hormones to keep his face pretty and his voice soaring high. &quot;Not true,&quot; says Riggs. &quot;I&#39;m his voice teacher, and I&#39;d know. He started out with a high voice, and I&#39;ve taken it even higher. He can sing low&mdash;down to a basso low C&mdash;but he prefers to sing as high as he does because pop tenors have more range to create style.&quot; The power of gossip is such that it has penetrated the iron gates that surround the Jackson never-never land out in Encino. It takes no effort of imagination to calculate what talk like that must do to a proud father and a mother who is a devout churchwoman. In addition to his door-to-door field service, which, according to his mother, &quot;he does twice a week maybe for an hour or two,&quot; Michael attends meetings at a Kingdom Hall four tunes a week. On Sundays, he fasts.</span></p></body>
