I found him to be very down to earth, funny and kind. Always laughing and joking around, but also curious. He remained young at heart and was always looking to learn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This hunger for knowledge started when he was a child when he would watch the performances of his idols such as Jackie Wilson and James Brown. Michael was a sponge, and he ab- sorbed their talents. He once said, that &lsquo;If you want to be great, then you have to study the masters&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson for me was certainly one of the masters. A true musical icon, whose achievements and talent will probably never be surpassed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was a great inspiration for me and millions of others whom he has stirred to follow our dreams and reach for the stars. Singers, dancers, writers and even poets look up to the work of Michael Jackson, and realise that with hard work and dedica- tion, creative talent can make us smile, and even change the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;d like to thank Diversity for being here today as we unveil this special plaque, and feel that it is very apt Britain&#39;s best dance group are part of this memorial - for they have all been influ- enced by the artistry and genius of Michael Jackson. Most of them weren&#39;t born when the &lsquo;Thriller&#39; video first hit our screens, but they all certainly know the moves from songs such as &lsquo;Smooth Criminal&#39;, &lsquo;Dangerous&#39;, &lsquo;Beat It&#39; and &lsquo;Bad&#39;, which they and others implement into their own choreography and routines so well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We are now in our second year here at the Lyric Theatre, and are currently booking until January 2011, with demand for the show still high in the West End as well as on our touring produc- tions, which has already seen us visit Germany, Italy, Holland, Poland, Belgium, and Austria amongst others with China and South Africa soon to follow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, what started of as a celebration of Michael Jackson&#39;s music and artistry, sadly became the ultimate tribute when the news of his tragic passing broke on the 25th June 2009. I was indeed truly &lsquo;Speechless&#39; as I heard my mentor was gone. I did not believe it was or could be true. Neither could our talented cast and crew. They were all shocked and devastated, most of them in tears.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A year ago we had to decide whether to cancel the show out of respect for Michael, or let the show continue knowing that we had a sold-out performance the evening of the 26th. We de- cided to go ahead and commemorate Michael&#39;s life, with what turned out to be one of the most emotionally charged evening of our lives. Following a minutes silence the cast, brought together by Gary Lloyd - the Director and Choreographer of &lsquo;Thriller Live&#39;, delivered a performance that Michael would have been proud of.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we continue to do that to this very day. Whilst we cannot replicate Michael Jackson on stage, we can certainly honour him with a brilliant concert that celebrates his life, his music and dance. &lsquo;Thriller Live&#39; is a show for all ages, from as young as 5 to those still getting down on the dancefloor at 70. It&#39;s a feel good, high-energy show, where the audience can sing a long to great songs such as &lsquo;Billie Jean&#39; and &lsquo;Man In The Mirror&#39;, or marvel at the dancing in classics like &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie&#39; and &lsquo;Don&#39;t Stop Til&#39; You Get Enough&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We have had many famous personalities see the show, from Alexandra Burke singing in the aisles to Peter Crouch moon- walking backstage. But none thrilled our cast more than the per- sonal endorsement of the Jackson brothers themselves, when Marlon, Tito and Jackie Jackson came to see the show last year - they were full of praise for the productions content and au- thenticity. This meant a lot to us all - sound, lighting, wardrobe, the band, the cast, creatives and producers, Flying Music, who have all worked so hard to make this a show that replicates some of the magic that was Michael Jackson live on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Indeed Michael himself was due to come and watch &lsquo;Thriller Live&#39; during his stay in London last year. He had told &lsquo;This Is It&#39; Director, Kenny Ortega, that he was planning on coming, but in disguise, so that he did not get mobbed!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I so wish he had come to see the show, but more so I wish he was still here to entertain us all, and to raise his three beautiful children. We often forget that not only was Michael Jackson one of the world&#39;s greatest entertainers, but he was also everyday man who was father to three great kids, Paris, Prince and Blan- ket - who he loved from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We unveil this plaque here at the Lyric Theatre West End, in memory of Michael Jackson the entertainer, the humanitarian and also the individual who I&#39;ll always remember as a kind, lov- ing and genuine soul.</span></p></body>
