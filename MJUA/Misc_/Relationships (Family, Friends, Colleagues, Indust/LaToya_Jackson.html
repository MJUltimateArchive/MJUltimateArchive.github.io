		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">LaToya Jackson</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808114429/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/fam_invites.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Bop&rdquo; magazine (1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The first thing you see as you drive slowly down the brick driveway towards the house is a three-car garage with the word &quot;Welcome&quot; elaborately painted in old English lettering over the garage doors. Michael gets his point across--you immediately feel welcome!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s touch is everywhere...well, almost everywhere. There is one exception--the kitchen. Spacious, perfectly clean, and organized and stocked with all the latest kitchen gadgets, it&#39;s probably the one place in the house that Michael rarely ventures into except to pass through on the way to another room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael really doesn&#39;t care much about food&quot;, laughs 28-year-old LaToya, his beautiful sister who resides in the house with Michael, their parents, and younger sister Janet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We really have to keep after him to eat&quot;, LaToya continues. &quot;I wish I was that way, but I&#39;m not. Life is one constant diet for me!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;I have to work at maintaining my size&quot;, admits LaToya, &quot;whereas Michael doesn&#39;t. I get food cravings and will pig out on something like lasagna. Michael never does that. He has such great discipline. I try, but sometimes the food wins! It&#39;s a never ending battle for me, but with Michael it&#39;s almost like the opposite.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Sometimes we have to sit him down and make sure he eats&quot;, continued LaToya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;He is always so busy. At times, he just forgets to eat. People don&#39;t realize how much he has on his mind. And he is always creating, always doing something. Michael has a very high energy level. Where he gets all that energy, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s great to be around him, because it can be contagious!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Every Sunday Michael fasts, which means he doesn&#39;t eat anything at all and only drinks water or fruit juices. LaToya does the same thing, but unlike Michael, her energy level seems to drop on Sundays while Michael&#39;s seems to go even higher.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We both fast on Sundays, but on that day Michael will dance for hours perfecting his moves, while I tend to feel a little drained of energy&quot;, confides LaToya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I do feel better after a fast, because it does cleanse your body. Michael, however, thrives on it. He encourages me to watch my diet and keep my weight down, but it&#39;s a lot easier for him than anyone else in the family.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;Michael is very healthy and he encourages everyone in the family to be also&quot;, reveals LaToya. &quot;If he teases you, that shows he cares enough about you to help you. I&#39;m a vegetarian and so is Janet. Actually, everyone in the family is and we do it not because Michael is one, but because it makes us feel healthier.&quot;</span></p></body>
