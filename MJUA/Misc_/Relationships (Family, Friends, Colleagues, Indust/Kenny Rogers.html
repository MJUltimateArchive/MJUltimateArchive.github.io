You know, just to get you through with some sense of sanity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I did a show tonight. I found out just before I went on the show. And I have to tell you, it impacted me so heavily in my show because it&#39;s hard to go out and do what I do and know that this has happened...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did a book called &quot;Your Friends and Mine.&quot; It&#39;s a photography book. And I called him, I said, Michael, I&#39;m promise you you&#39;ll only be here 15 minutes. He said, &ldquo;I&#39;m coming, and I&#39;m bringing Bubbles with me.&rdquo; And he was there for eight hours. He stayed there and wanted to chat and talk. And we took pictures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think I took the first picture of him with his head off. Because he said, I want to see what this looks like. So -- it&#39;s just -- he was just such a special guy. You know? And you don&#39;t meet guys who have that kind of success that really are able to communicate at a different level. And that&#39;s a success I would not wish on anybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: Kenny, as a success -- you&#39;re a country artist. How did you view him artistically?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ROGERS: Well, I mean, how do you view anybody that&#39;s had that kind -- first of all, you start off envying and then you&#39;re just thankful you don&#39;t have to go through what he went through. I mean that would have been treacherous for anybody. And so I loved his music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I thought that between he and Quincy Jones, they started a whole new -- they literally revolutionized the music business, literally. And there are very few people that represent certain eras of music. He definitely was one of them.</span></p></body>
