I&rsquo;m coming of age now and really [sic] realize the importance of true love. Joseph never ever had time for me, he only saw me as a way for him to make money. And as you know Mother was a perfect mother. But I never was with her, my childhood was on stage away from Mother. What I&rsquo;m Simply Trying To Say Is Thank you For Being a FATHER. I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened to me if you were not around. I love you, M.J.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.mjvibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LA-Auction-Dec-18-03.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">Handwritten letter to Bill Bray</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181211212623/https://www.mjvibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LA-Auction-Dec-18-03.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">), <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjvibe.com/more-personal-michael-jackson-items-on-auction/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Invaluable&rdquo; auction listing</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181211205244/https://www.mjvibe.com/more-personal-michael-jackson-items-on-auction/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bill, thank you so much for all the years of love and compassion.
