So we decided to hold back a little on our show. You know, not blow away the audience because we knew we were a hard act to follow. Then after our performance we watched from the wings and from that night on, through the rest of the tour, we had to pull out all the stops just to keep up with them. They were incredible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lionel remembered particularly the mischievous things they used to pull on each other during their visits from city to city on the tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He would put itching powder in your hat.
