He came to Motown, and they were talking about this boy from Gary, Ind., and the Jackson 5, and everyone was excited. He was a little boy then. He would always come into the studio curious about how I worked and what I did. &quot;How do you do that?&quot; &quot;Why do you do that?&quot; I think he understood clearly from seeing various people do the music scene that it definitely took work. He must have been around 9 or 10 then, and I definitely felt that he would be someone. You heard the voice, and all he could do was grow. And that&#39;s what he did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember playing air hockey one time, and we were going back and forth. I play air hockey on the side as opposed to the end of the table because it&#39;s more accessible for me to really understand what&#39;s happening. He said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re cheating.&quot; And I said, &quot;Aw, I&#39;m not cheating, come on.&quot; And we went on and on for hours, just playing air hockey and being silly. He had a childlike heart. And that was very, very impressive to me. At the end of the day, we&#39;re all human beings, and for those who can&#39;t see that it is possible for a man who&#39;s an adult to have a childlike spirit, it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re weird, it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re a freak or whatever ridiculous things people say. We have all kinds of people in the world. The most important thing is that your heart is in a good place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/michael-jackson-remembered-the-tributes-20140625/stevie-wonder-0704616"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (June 25, 2014)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I first heard about Michael when he and his brothers were coming to Motown &ndash; and then I heard that voice. You couldn&#39;t help but be instantly moved by the way Michael sang a song like &quot;I Want You Back&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot; or, later, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel,&quot; which is one of my favorites. One time, Michael and I were riding in an elevator together, and I was singing &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; to him, and we started going back and forth trading lines, and I told him how much I loved that part where he sang, &quot;Go on, girl,&quot; and Michael told me that he took it from my song &quot;Go Home,&quot; which made me feel pretty good. I remember we were on a kind of safari together once in a truck with bars to protect you from the lions. I could hear Michael telling the driver, &quot;Can we get a little closer?&quot; Then I heard a big roar and suddenly Michael got real quiet.</span></p></body>
