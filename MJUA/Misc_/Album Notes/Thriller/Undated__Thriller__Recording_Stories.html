Quincy turned to us and he said, &#39;OK guys, we&#39;re here to save the recording industry.&#39; Now that&#39;s a pretty big responsibility - but he meant it. And that&#39;s why those albums, and especially &#39;Thriller&#39;, sound so incredible.

And you can&rsquo;t have that volume and put it on at that length or you&rsquo;re going to &hellip; the length will control the amount of volume, and what we did was we ended up editing and cutting down the length of time on that first side so that we could put more level on the record.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">More level was exactly what was needed, but Michael was reluctant to change things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been to Bernie Grundman&rsquo;s to master </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. And I brought it back to Westlake Studio, and we were all there, including some of the label people to listen to it.

You can&rsquo;t have all that time on a record and still put the level on it to be competitive in the industry. And it was so noticeable &hellip; and this shows you how perceptive Michael is. While we were listening and the people from Epic were there and everything, by the time the first side was almost through, Michael snuck out of the studio and went across the hall to the other studio, which was empty at the time. And we didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;So Quincy and I looked at each other, and we also snuck out and went over to the other studio, and there was Michael in the corner sobbing, in tears because the sound was not right. And all I could think to say was, &lsquo;Okay, you guys, Quincy and Michael, I told you so.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d been fighting these edits all along, trying to get them to cut down on the songs. So what happened was that Quincy said, &lsquo;Okay, we&rsquo;re going to go back in the studio for eight days.

The Acusonic Recording Process (and the synonymous Quantum Range Recording Process) was not some kind of processing innovation, but rather a name for the manner in which Swedien synchronised multiple 24</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">track tape machines to access a practically limitless track count.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, despite the busting of the &#39;black box&#39; myth, there are indeed fundamental ways in which the Acusonic approach affected the sound of Thriller, and indeed its predecessor. In the first instance, it allowed Swedien to circumvent one of the deleterious side</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">effects of tape</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">based multitracking: that repeated playback of the tape during the overdubbing and production process would progressively dull the transients of previous recorded tracks. &quot;If you go back to the recordings I made with Michael, my big worry was that if those tapes got played repeatedly, the transient response would be minimised. I heard many recordings of the day that were very obviously done that way, and there were no transients left on those tapes. So what I would do would be to record the rhythm section on a 24</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">track tape, then take that tape and put it away and wouldn&#39;t play it again until the final mix. And &mdash; holy cow &mdash; what a difference that made! It was just incredible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By using a SMPTE timecode track on each tape and then sync&#39;ing the master rhythm</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">section tape to new reels, any number of &#39;work tapes&#39; could be generated for the purposes of overdubbing, each furnished with a handful of submixed cue tracks from the master reel. &quot;At the end of the tracking sessions, I could premix each of those tapes down to only a pair of tracks during the final mix, and that would give me a huge number of tracks to use. So, for example, all the background vocals on &#39;Rock With You&#39; were recorded on a separate 24</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">track, and then I premixed them for the final mix.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While transient definition is clearly a hallmark of these records, Acusonic&#39;s practically limitless track count was also crucial, because it allowed Swedien the freedom to indulge his passion for stereo recording, an enthusiasm reaching back to his days with Bill Putnam in Chicago. What this meant was that a large proportion of the overdubs on Michael Jackson&#39;s albums were actually recorded in stereo, thereby improving the sense of width, realism, and emotional immediacy. As he comments in his new book, In The Studio With Michael Jackson: &quot;These true stereo images add much to the depth and clarity of the final production. I have a feeling that this one facet of my production technique contributes more to the overall sonic character of my work than any other single factor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...While the Acusonic Recording Process clearly played an important role in delivering Thriller&#39;s unique wide</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">screen, percussive sound, it&#39;s clear from speaking to Bruce Swedien that there&#39;s more to the recipe than fresh tape. Credit must also go to his own personal collection of classic mics, which he ferries around to all his recording sessions. (See the &#39;Bruce Swedien&#39;s Microphones&#39; box for more details.) &quot;All of my mics I bought new, and all of the really important ones are sequential serial numbers. No</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">one else has ever used them, so they&#39;re all in really good condition. That&#39;s part of the secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Given Swedien&#39;s repeated emphasis on maximising pickup of transients through mic selection and careful use of the recording medium, it makes sense that he has trenchant views on the use of compression. &quot;I&#39;m not a big fan of compression or limiting at all &mdash; I can&#39;t emphasise that enough. On many of the recordings that you hear today, all the excitement and all the colour is gone because they&#39;re so over</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">compressed. I never did that. I would never have a compressor or limiter on the [master] bus, for instance. I want all that transient information there. And no compression or limiting on any drums or percussion. That&#39;s one of the biggest mistakes that I hear, I think, in modern pop recording. The stuff is so compressed they&#39;ve limited the living doo</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">doo out of the sound.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s not to say that he leaves the dynamics of the performance completely untouched, but is much more inclined to achieve the required dynamic control through to</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">tape fader rides while overdubbing and automation while mixing. &quot;I&#39;m a nutcase about details in the mix, so I&#39;ll use automation to a degree, but only very subtle compression. I have a pair of the new variety of [Universal Audio] LA2As that I just love, so I will use those, but it&#39;ll only just be tickling the meter, at the most one or two decibels. I don&#39;t like what happens to the sound when you compress any further, and that&#39;s very important to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bill Wolfer, keyboardist, &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; magazine (November 2014) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190805083253/http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once, when we were recording the demos for Thriller in Encino, we took a break.

He raised his hand to the sky with the bird seed in his open palm, and stood there like a statue. I thought he had lost his mind, what&rsquo;s he doing?

Highly successful -- talk about understatements.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Steve Lukather: It was a great honor to work with Michael and Quincy on what is to be a legendary record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...HARRIS: How did you come to meet Michael, and how is it that you and Steve Porcaro came to work on &quot;Thriller&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: Well, actually, I had worked on Quincy Jones&#39;s &quot;The Dude&quot; record, which was an album of the year. And then our record was album of the year, the next record, &quot;Toto IV,&quot; and then &quot;Thriller,&quot; Quincy asked us to come in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Actually, Michael called me on the phone, and I didn&#39;t believe it was really him, so I gave him a bunch of grief because he woke me up in the morning. It was kind of funny, and then I found out it was really him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy&#39;s office called and said, &quot;No, that was really Michael,&quot; because I kept hanging up on him. But, you know, ,he was really a nice guy to work with, a total pro. And like I said, it was a great honor to be a part of something so huge. You know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: Hey, Steve, what tracks did you play on?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: I played on &quot;Beat It.&quot; I played all the rhythm guitar parts and the bass. And Eddie did the solo. And Jeff Porcaro did the drums and Michael sang.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And then I played on &quot;Human Nature,&quot; which Steve Porcaro wrote, played all the keyboards on. And I played guitar on that. And I did the duet with Paul McCartney as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: Yes, &quot;The Girl is Mine.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: Yes. What do you remember about Michael working in those sessions?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: Just, you know, he was very specific, he was very focused on the work. He knew what he wanted. And if he liked something, you could tell right away. If he was iffy about it, he would let you know. But he was very pleasant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was always a ton of people around, so it was kind of daunting, really. But once we got into the work and people kind of disappeared, and it was just Quincy, Michael and myself, or whoever, if we were cutting a track, just the musicians itself, it was really great.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And it was a total -- you know, Quincy is always an ultimate class act. And Bruce Wadine (ph), the engineer. I mean, it was just people I felt very comfortable with because we worked together before.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: So, Steve, apart from the tracks you worked on, on &quot;Thriller,&quot; is there a signature Michael Jackson song for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: Oh, jeez. I mean, you know, that whole record is full of them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: You know what I mean? And also, &quot;Off the Wall&quot; was a great record, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: There you go.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: It was the album to be on if you were, like, a session guy at that time. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we were asked because I guess we liked what he did. So I never thought this day would come. I mean, he&#39;s my age. So, it&#39;s kind of weird. You get just kind of creeped out. You know, the harsh reality of life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HARRIS: Tell me about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LUKATHER: I mean, I didn&#39;t really know the guy as a personal friend, per se, just as a working situation. He was very pleasant and a very nice guy. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Matt Forger, sound engineer</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ data bank: How and when did you meet Michael Jackson ?

We heard there were some 16-track machines plugged to each other to get even more tracks available?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Matt Forger: The THRILLER project was typical of the day in that it was recorded on 24 track analog tape.

There were two 24 track machines in the control room and the tapes were &#39;multiplexed&#39; in a fashion that allowed many tracks to be recorded while monitoring the elements already on tape. The system worked by recording the rhythm section of a song on a master 24 track Master tape and generating work tapes that would contain cue mixes and with many empty tracks allowing ample tracks for the layering of sounds.</span></p></td><td class="cs4A1C322C" valign="top" width="254"><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr>

He also used a Harrison recording console. This kind of equipment eventually became studio recording references. Can you tell us more about that ?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Matt Forger: Bruce&#39;s Acusonic Recording Process is as much about his philosophy of sound, as it was technology. As he explains it, he has always believed in &nbsp;maintaining the integrity of the stereo image of the sound source from the initial recording through the final mix. This is why the many tapes and number of tracks became an integral part of the Thriller production.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Harrison console that was used at Westlake Studios was typical of the mixing boards of the era. It was however modified by the technical staff of the studio to provide the superior sonic character that has become the benchmark of modern album production. Bruce has always favored a certain type of sonic signature and it was the studios desire to ensure that he had the best quality of equipment to do the job.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ data bank: Thriller in the making: you witnessed how the album was created, and the songs selected: in your opinion, what kind of material could have make it on the album? What was the global approach of Quincy, Bruce and Michael that finally had them selecting some songs instead of other ones?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Matt Forger: The song selection was an evolution. It began with Quincy and Rod Temperton reviewing countless tapes and submissions. Quincy would go through a process called &#39;Polaroids&#39; where he would &#39;snapshot&#39; the best songs to get a feel for the key, tempo, how Michael&#39;s voice would react to the song, that type of thing. Then, we would come back work on the best and as the character of the album was being built, additional songs were considered and added. Quincy was looking to cover many sides of Michael&#39;s talent and wanted to make sure that his versatility was displayed.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">The one thing that was of highest importance was the strength of the songs. Only the best made it on the album. After all, the entire process of recording an album is dependent on the strength of the material. If you don&#39;t have the best songs, you don&#39;t have the foundation to build great production on. We all were very aware of that.</span></p><table class="cs9CFAC749" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="624" style="border-collapse:collapse;">

When you are fatigued by the long hours of work you may not be 100% on top of your game, and that&#39;s what was what was needed.

He is a perfectionist and demands the best. But you would expect nothing less from him. His standard of professionalism has always been of the highest level. Michael always searches for the newest most exciting sounds and qualities in recording, and yet always has patience and understands the time consuming process of exploring developing new sounds. I have had the opportunity to work with Michael in a variety of situations and have worked hard to find or develop new technologies to address the creative ideas he wishes to pursue.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">The rule of the studio has always been to make the technology follow the creative direction of the music.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">After having so much experience working with him, it becomes second nature to intuitively go where the music leads, or follow Michael&#39;s ideas to where the music takes him.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ data bank: What is the difference between working on a studio project and a live or staged one?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Matt Forger: When you are on a stage performing live nothing can be too big. The dynamics are huge, sound, lighting, props, and special effects all contribute to the experience. While in the studio, you are working with just the music and lyrics but trying to achieve the same results. Everything must fit into a smaller package, so the challenge is greater and the manipulation is a lot more delicate in the studio.

The quality of the album inspired many people, in the music industry and individuals as well.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">The energy and emotion of Michael&rsquo;s performances were astounding. People were revitalized in believing that music could achieve great results. This was proven by the projects that followed, &quot;We Are The World&quot; as an example. There was a note of optimism in the world and people felt good about themselves and the world around them.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was the music that accomplished this.

Hundreds of song were submitted for &quot;Thriller&quot;, but Quincy kept saying to Michael that he wanted some different songs. Very near the end of production, Michael went off and wrote &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot;.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">What is it that makes their relationship so successful?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Quincy is brilliant. He has great musical awareness, but it&#39;s more than that. He is easy going, he understands Michael&#39;s personality, and he knows how to work with people.

It was somebody that was in the room a lot. And he said that Michael would do a take, and just give it his all, and then Quincy would say, &quot;Oh, my God, that was the best singing I had ever heard! That&#39;s incredible!

He had this whole concept of all the songs being strong on their own.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite Quincy Jones&#39; prominence, Ndugu firmly believes that the album could not have been the classic it was without all the individuals involved pooling their gifts.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was a total team effort&quot;, he says, &quot;it was Michael Jackson, the super talent and songwriter, Quincy Jones, the visionary producer that approached making that record from a different perspective, Bruce Swedien, the sound master, that brought all of that technology to fruition where that record was a marriage of creativity and technology, and the combination of the quality of musicians and the songs, all together made for a super project. No one entity alone made that project, it was the strengths of all those people involved collectively.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the &quot;Thriller&quot; sessions, Ndugu played a Yamaha Custom kit made from sacaranda wood and Paiste 602 cymbals. He quickly found that Bruce Swedien liked to keep the sounds of each part of the kit as isolated as possible while still allowing Ndugu to play the set as a whole.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Bruce Swedien had this pad that fits over the front of the bass drum, then the mic goes through and is zipped into it. He also had a lead screen that he put on the snare drum mic stand that blocked leakage from the hi-hat to the snare drum mic.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We recorded the drums on a 16-track analogue tape machine, only the drums&quot;, explains Ndugu, as analogue tape was generally considered to capture the warmth and fatness of the drums better than digital. &quot;You&#39;d have two tracks of bass drum, two tracks of snare drum, and all of that, so you could get different EQs on each one.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Each night, I went in and did one song, although on one day I did two songs. I did &#39;P.Y.T.&#39; and &#39;Baby Be Mine&#39;, and then one session, I did &#39;Billie Jean&#39;, and one session, I did &#39;Thriller&#39;. At the time we did that album, they had all three studios going, because Michael was also working on the &#39;E.T. Storybook&#39; album. They were doing horns and synthesizers in another studio and I was doing my drum overdubs in another studio.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Looking back on what made the sound on that album so significant, Ndugu says, &quot;I think it is one of the more superior sounds I have ever heard and the reason I think that is because that was the first time and one of the only times I&#39;ve heard live drums and drum machines playing exactly the same thing in sync without using Pro Tools and giving each one a personality of their own. What you&#39;re hearing is a drum machine and live drums playing together all through the album.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout the process, Ndugu was impressed by Michael&#39;s dedication and passion. &quot;I walked in one night and he was recording a vocal in the dark in the studio&quot;, he remembers. &quot;I didn&#39;t know he was out there, because I couldn&#39;t see him until he said, &#39;Let me do that part again.&#39; It sounded fantastic, but what I learned from that was he was totally into the music in that he already knew all his lyrics, he didn&#39;t have to read and he didn&#39;t have to see. He was going on his spirit feel and it sounded great.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Walter Yetnikoff, CBS/Columbia Records president, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">Telegraph (November 25, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102410/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191214075455/https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">I used to get calls from Michael in the middle of the night. &#39;Walter, the record is not Number 1 [anymore]&#39; - and this is &#39;Thriller&#39; - &#39;What are we going to do?&#39; I said, &#39;We&#39;re going to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow.&#39;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs76EFAA84">User &ldquo;Bizzvanwa&rdquo;, keyboardist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.theroot.com/michael-jackson-memories-1790869680"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Root&rdquo; (June 25, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191211091525/https://www.theroot.com/michael-jackson-memories-1790869680"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Right before Thriller was released, Michael came into the club where I was playing (the Rose Tattoo) and listened to me play and my partner sing for a few hours.
