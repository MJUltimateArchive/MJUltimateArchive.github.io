Michael wrote the original version, which failed to make Bad, and then reworked it with Teddy Riley during the Dangerous sessions. After it failed to make the cut once more, the song was completed in April 1992. It was released a month later as an exclusive Pepsi promotional cassette-only single; 500,000 copies were made available by collecting a winning token from certain Pepsi products. &ldquo;I wrote it originally years ago and Teddy loved it, I loved it, and we made some changes, just changed the verse and I gave him co-writer&rsquo;s credit,&rdquo; Michael said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brad Sundberg, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.facebook.com/inthestudiowithmj/posts/838232206350675:0"><span class="cs8567212B">Facebook post (November 28, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One evening [studio engineer Thom Russo] and I were doing some edits to the flugel horn solo on the song &quot;Someone Put Your Hand Out&quot;, and we started doing crazy pitch manipulation to the horn. It&#39;s hard to explain why it was so funny, but the long hours and constant exhaustion caught up with us as we intentionally destroyed the solo for our own pleasure - and we laughed so hard that I think he rolled on the floor and I wiped tears off my cheeks. Remind me and I&#39;ll play it for you sometime at a seminar, but it&#39;s sort of one of those &quot;you had to be there&quot; things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
