Literally healing our planet of its wounds and its suffering, and I think it&#39;s--it&#39;s one of my favorite things to do when we&#39;re on tour. Because, on stage, we blow up this giant inflatable planet Earth right on stage, and we have all these children from different countries, and they dress in their different national attire, and we sing the song. And it&#39;s amazing to look out in the audience, and you&#39;ll literally see, like, 200,000 people holding up candles and seeing the song. It&#39;s a very spiritual experience, and I really enjoy it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Teddy Riley, producer (not for this song)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This has strong global issues &ndash; it was a big song.

I thought it needed different things that would really appeal. I did quite a lot of the percussion on there.
