As most of McCartney&rsquo;s 1982 album Tug of War was already completed at this stage, he chose to keep the songs for his next record. This also gave the pair time to fine-tune the tracks later down the line...In early February [1983], he returned to London to complete work on two songs he had been recording on and off with Paul McCartney over the previous two years, &lsquo;Say Say Say&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Man&rsquo;.)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bill Wolfer, keyboardist, &ldquo;Invincible&rdquo; magazine (November 2014) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190805083253/http://mjstrangersite.com/bill-wolfer-alchimiste-du-son/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael called to ask if I would help with a demo. I said sure, do you want me to come over to your house? He said, no, can we do it at yours? I was surprised that he would come to me, but why not? Maybe he wanted to get out of the house. When he came over, my wife was watching a rerun of &ldquo;Grease&rdquo; on TV. Michael flopped on the couch, saying, &ldquo;I love this movie!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After it was over, he took out a cassette, and it was only then that I learned that it was a song that he and Paul McCartney had written. Michael wanted to do an elaborate demo to show Paul his vision of the song. The cassette was just Paul on acoustic guitar, and he and Michael singing. We worked out the beat on a Linn LM-1 drum machine, and recorded a basic demo of Rhodes piano, synth bass and the drum machine on my four track recorder. This was used a few days later in the studio to teach the song to Nate Watts (bass) and Ricky Lawson (drums). We laid down the track, just the three of us, and then David Williams did guitar overdubs. Later that week, I came in to do some synth overdubs, and watched him record the horns and harmonica solo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was pretty elaborate for a demo! Michael confided in me that he was doing a full 24 track recording in the hope that Paul would just use his version, adding their vocals and mixing it. Months later, Michael told me the story. He had flown to England, and played the demo for Paul. Paul immediately heard the sound quality, and asked, &ldquo;Is this 24 track?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said it was. Paul said, &ldquo;Did you bring it with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And, of course he had. So, the &lsquo;demo&rsquo; became the record, just as Michael had hoped.</span></p></body>
