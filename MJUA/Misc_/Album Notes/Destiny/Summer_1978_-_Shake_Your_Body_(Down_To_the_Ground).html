But his brothers wanted him to prioritise The Jacksons&rsquo; next album, Destiny, the first the group were to write and produce as a whole. After years of disappointing sales it was a make or break album for the brothers, and Michael reluctantly agreed to put family ahead of his own solo ambitions.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">August 1978 Demo:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/_D4eNDZVrQs"><span class="cs8567212B">https://youtu.be/_D4eNDZVrQs</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, Moonwalk</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),&rdquo; our set piece on the album, turned out to be a lifesaver for us onstage because we already had a good jam in the studio to build on. It was frustrating to have finally realized our dream of having our own music as the showpiece, rather than the novelty song, and not being able to give it our very best shot. It wasn&rsquo;t long, however, before our time would come.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103119/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/12new.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; (October 19, 1984)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (contains 1979 interview)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s the first published single that Randy and I have had. We wrote it on the piano. Naturally, we&#39;re pretty happy about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John Luongo, mixer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.disco-disco.com/djs/john-l.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">Disco-Disco.com interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the mixing of &quot;Shake Your Body Down&quot; by the Jackson&#39;s I worked for over 29 hours (!!!) straight with NO BREAK!! When the record was finally done, I had not noticed that we, me and my engineer, Michael Barbiero, had edited so much new tape into the 1/4&quot; reel that when we fast rewound the tape it was extending over 1&quot; past the end of the reel and was in jeopardy of being twisted and destroyed!! Michael saw this, yelled to me and he and I in sync grabbed on reel each with our bare hands to stop them from damaging the tape. The recording was saved but the tape machine got a bit bloody from slicing both our hands. The effort was worth it, the record went #1 on R&amp;B and POP charts and saved the Jacksons&rsquo; career. True Story!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Katherine Jackson, &ldquo;My Family, the Jacksons&rdquo; (November 1990)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RANDY: We told CBS, &ldquo;No, no, no, don&rsquo;t put out &lsquo;Blame It on the Boogie&rsquo;; put out &lsquo;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),&rsquo;&rdquo; which Michael and I had written. But CBS loved &ldquo;Boogie&rdquo;; also, I think they still didn&rsquo;t believe in us one hundred percent.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KATHERINE: Happily, &ldquo;Shake Your Body&rdquo; became the album&rsquo;s second single. It did very well, peaking at number seven on Billboard&rsquo;s pop chart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RANDY: Actually, that song should have been number one. It sold two million copies, a great figure for a single. But I don&rsquo;t think pop radio or the press was ready to accept our return just yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110244/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/blackstarsawesome79.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Black Stars&quot; (May 1979)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the brothers grew mentally, physically, and creatively, their musical direction took on new heights of achievement. &quot;Michael and I love to work on writing tunes&quot;, says Randy, the youngest member of the aggregation. &quot;A lot of times, I&#39;ll develop a particular melody and Michael will write the lyrics. Occasionally, we&#39;ll all write music and lyrics together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;Shake Your Body&quot;, the smash disco tune from the &quot;Destiny&quot; LP has proved to its writers, Randy and Michael Jackson that there is a special blend of rhythmic melodies that grabs people by the pulse of their body. Commenting on the highly successful bounce tune, Michael Jackson, the dynamic twenty-year-old lead singer of The Jacksons, says, &quot;When I was living in New York, shooting &#39;The Wiz&#39; movie, I often visited Studio 54. I noticed what beats made people respond enthusiastically. You know I really love to dance, and nothing pleases me more than for people to enjoy our songs on the dance floor.&quot;</span></p></body>
