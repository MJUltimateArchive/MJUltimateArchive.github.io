How was the first collaboration?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nick Brandt: Very good. I was very lucky, Michael loved the end result. We shot the video in a forest, in the heart of a natural park, a car park north of Los Angeles. The entire clip was shot in a week. We spent four nights outside in the woods, then two days in the studio to film the flying boats on the Bluescreen. But Michael was not present.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: Did Michael take part in the staging of this clip?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: No. I suggested the concept to him and he liked it. He liked the idea of ​​the forest at night, and the children who wanted to fly away. This is a metaphor for childhood dreams. The idea of ​​always pursuing his dreams touched Michael very much. He gave me the staging and the cut. I showed him the end result and it told him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: What did these videos cost?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: The most expensive was Earth Song with a budget of $ 2.6 million. Stranger in Moscow cost 1.8 million Cry, I do not remember exactly, but I believe it amounted to about 1 million just as with Childhood.</span></p></body>
