This is one of his most unknown clips. How did he come about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nick Brandt: We shot him shortly after September 11, 2001. I suggested to Michael this concept of a human chain that goes through all countries. The idea was to show people united. The theme suited the circumstances at the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: Michael does not appear in the final version of the clip. It is said that he refused to appear because of the conflict he had with Sony at that time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: No, it had nothing to do with Sony. Michael should actually appear in the video. One should see it in the human chain, on the rock, in the middle of the clip. We shot this sequence in the north of California and he should meet us there. The problem was that Michael was frightened by the assassination risks after September 11th. He did not want to move much. The thought of crossing a part of California to take part in the shooting made him afraid.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: How did you avoid his absence?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: To be honest, I was incredibly relieved when I learned that he would not come! I always thought the video would run better without it. I found that his presence in the human chain was not necessary. Firstly, if he had been there, it would have broken the course of the shoot. The video is a kind of continuous movement that follows the human chain through different places. If Michael had been there, he would have to stay with him for a moment. In addition, the clip would have been over-exposed and the whole lighting of the clip would have been wobbly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: Did Michael Jackson not mind not appearing in the clip even though it was intended?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: To be honest, I wanted to create a version of the clip without Michael from the beginning. Even if he had been at the show, I would have shown him a version without him so he could see that it worked so much better. And so it came to the end. At the end of the shoot we saw each other and I showed him the clip, just as I had cut it and presented it to me. After gazing at him attentively, he asked me when we would shoot his sequences to add them to the clip. Right there I explained my point of view. I told him that I think it would be better if he were not in the clip. Because of the given message of the song and the international context - it was shortly after September 11th, it seemed to me more modest and consequently more appropriate, if it did not appear in the clip. Michael paused for a moment, thinking about what I had just told him. And then he said &quot;Okay&quot; with much modesty. And the matter was resolved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black or White Magazine: What did these videos cost?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandt: The most expensive was Earth Song with a budget of $ 2.6 million. Stranger in Moscow cost 1.8 million Cry, I do not remember exactly, but I believe it amounted to about 1 million just as with Childhood.</span></p></body>
