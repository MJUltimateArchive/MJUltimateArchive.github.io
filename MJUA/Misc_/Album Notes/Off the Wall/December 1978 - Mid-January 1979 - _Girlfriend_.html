You know, the Paul McCartney song I did, &lsquo;Girlfriend&rsquo;? The first time I met Paul McCartney was on the Queen Mary, and then I met again at a party he throw at Harold Lloyd&rsquo;s estate here in L.A. Him and Linda came up to me and said, &lsquo;We wrote you a song&rsquo; and they started singing, &ldquo;Girlfriend, da-da-dee-dee-dee-dee.&rdquo; I said, &lsquo;Oh, I really like it, when can we get together?&rsquo; So he gave me his Scotland number and the number in London, but we never got together on the whole thing. The next I noticed it he had the song on his &ldquo;London Town&rdquo; album. Then one day I went to Quincy&rsquo;s house and he said, &lsquo;You know what&rsquo;s great a song for you? This McCartney song called &ldquo;Girlfriend&rdquo;.&rsquo; I just flipped out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael giggles at the symmetry of success.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Paul McCartney sent me a telegram not too long ago raving over how much he loved mine better than his, and now I&rsquo;m going to be doing some things on his next album. We&rsquo;ll write a couple of songs together as a team &ndash; that&rsquo;s one of my next projects after the Jacksons album in March. If I sing, that&rsquo;ll be nice, but that&rsquo;s up to him because it&rsquo;s his album.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
