After cutting the rhythm tracks Temperton returned to New York, where he completed the lyrics, before flying back to Los Angeles the following weekend to record vocals with Michael. Background vocals were recorded on the Saturday afternoon, and the three lead vocals were done the next day&hellip; The three songs Temperton submitted for the album, &lsquo;Off the Wall&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rock With You&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burn This Disco Out&rsquo;, are all disco themed.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjjcollectors.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;category_id=182&amp;product_id=5629&amp;Itemid=136"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Hot Rocks: Michael Jackson&rdquo; radio special (October 31, 1987)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190926212824/http://www.mjjcollectors.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;category_id=182&amp;product_id=5629&amp;Itemid=136"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael talks about how they came up with the song &quot;Rock With You&quot;, and how it was written by former &quot;Heatwave&quot; member Rod Temperton&hellip; &quot;Quincy told him to write a song about &quot;The Rock&quot;, which is a dance. &nbsp;But we wanted to have a double meaning about &quot;rocking&quot; a girl and doing the dance, the rock, you know, a little nasty (laughs)... and he came up with the song, which was wonderful.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rod Temperton, songwriter, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rock With You was a rhythm section I&rsquo;d had before.&lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d go with this one because he&rsquo;s good at handling very melodic things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John &quot;JR&quot; Robinson, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;Rod [Temperton] was this great writer. All of us converged in LA at the exact same time and all through Quincy, which was extraordinary&quot;, says JR. &quot;About a week or so later, Quincy asked me, &#39;Why don&#39;t we get your band [Rufus] and record this next tune?&#39; That happened to be &#39;Rock with You&#39;, so it was Bobby Watson on bass, who is in my band now, and Hawk Wolinski, the keyboard player who wrote &#39;Ain&#39;t Nobody&#39;. So, it was Rufus that cut &#39;Rock with You&#39;, Michael&#39;s greatest song, in my opinion.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All this time later, JR still singles out &quot;Rock With You&quot; as his favorite song from his work with Michael, even though he was under pressure in the studio at the time. With Rod Temperton in the room, JR was put on the spot to come up with a truly memorable opening for the track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Quincy looks at me and he goes, &#39;JR, I want you to come up with a drum fill that will be forever associated with his song.&#39; I look at him and go, &#39;Wow, you&#39;re not going to put me under any pressure, are you?&#39; Rod had a demo, so I took an idea from that and came up with that drum fill. Generally, as a drummer, when I&#39;m playing in some sort of 16th-note vibe, I don&#39;t like any triplets going with 16th-notes in a po tune, it just sounds foreign to me. So, what did I do? I did exactly like that, I combined a triplet with a 16th note accent on the kick drum and came up with the intro. You could ask any lay person in the world, when they hear that, they don&#39;t even have to hear the song, they know it&#39;s &#39;Rock With You&#39;&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bruce Swedien, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/michael-jackson-the-making-of-a-king-part-3"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Goldmine&rdquo; magazine (April 9, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190629015229/https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/michael-jackson-the-making-of-a-king-part-3"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And if you think of &lsquo;Rock With You&rsquo; and the harmonies, holy cow &hellip; and the background.

This secondary pickup of the low</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">frequency end of the drum kit can travel through walls!

Each of the backing-vocal lines was first double</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">‑</span><span class="csD5D7D290">tracked with a close mic, then Jackson moved a couple of steps back from the mic for another pass, while Swedien increased the preamp gain to match his level with the previous takes. Finally, an even more distant pass was captured using a Blumlein stereo pair, again matched for level. The result: an increased density of early reflections, which creates a natural depth and width to the soundfield.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Re-arranged version, slightly jazzed-up (jazzy guitar and added handclaps), dating from early 1980, was included on new pressings of OFF THE WALL, replacing the original recording.
