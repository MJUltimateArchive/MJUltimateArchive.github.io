Over the course of the late spring and summer, Michael began working on more and more songs.&rdquo; (Mike Smallcombe, &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Primetime Live interview (June 14, 1995)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diane Sawyer: In a song you say, &quot;Jew me, sue me&quot;. And some people are saying that that is anti-semitic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: It&#39;s not anti-semitic because I&#39;m not a racist. I could never be a racist. I love all races of people, from Arabs, to Jewish people...like I said before, to blacks. But when I say, &quot;Jew me, sue me, everybody do me, kick me, kike me, don&#39;t you black or white me&quot; I&#39;m talking about myself as the victim, you know. My accountants and lawyers are Jewish. My three best friends are Jewish&hellip; David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, Mike Milkin. These are friends of mine. They&#39;re all Jewish. So how does that make sense? I was raised in a Jewish community.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &ldquo;<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/15/arts/in-new-lyrics-jackson-uses-slurs.html"><span class="cs8567212B">New York Times&rdquo; (June 15, 1995)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200311195143/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/15/arts/in-new-lyrics-jackson-uses-slurs.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The idea that these lyrics could be deemed objectionable is extremely hurtful to me, and misleading. The song in fact is about the pain of prejudice and hate and is a way to draw attention to social and political problems. I am the voice of the accused and the attacked. I am the voice of everyone. I am the skinhead, I am the Jew, I am the black man, I am the white man. I am not the one who was attacking. It is about the injustices to young people and how the system can wrongfully accuse them. I am angry and outraged that I could be so misinterpreted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Letter to deans of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/17/arts/michael-jackson-apologizes-for-hurt-caused-by-lyrics.html"><span class="cs8567212B">New York Times</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> and <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-23/entertainment/ca-16138_1_michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">LA Times</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">, June 17, 1995)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There has been a lot of controversy about my song, &#39;They Don&#39;t Care About Us.&#39; My intention was for this song to say &#39;No&#39; to racism, anti-Semitism and stereotyping. Unfortunately, my choice of words may have unintentionally hurt the very people I wanted to stand in solidarity with. I just want you all to know how strongly I am committed to tolerance, peace and love, and I apologize to anyone who might have been hurt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Respectfully, Michael Jackson</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Re-record announcement (June 22, 1995 - snippet in <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-23/entertainment/ca-16138_1_michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">LA Times</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> - Copy of the full Daily Variety statement available in <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://jetzi-mjvideo.com/books-jetzi-01/09km/09km11.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Armond White&rsquo;s &ldquo;Keep Moving: The Michael Jackson Chronicles&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> / Below)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My sole intention with the song &ldquo;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&rdquo; was to use language to demonstrate the ugliness of racism, anti-Semitism, and stereotyping. I had hoped that my lyrics would target the bigots, not the victims of bigotry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Because of the unforeseen reaction to specific words in my song by many people around the world, I have chosen to re-record it, deleting the words found offensive. In doing so, I acknowledge that I seriously offended some people which was never my intention and for that I am deeply sorry. I have come to understand over the past days that these words are considered anti-Semitic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although I cannot erase any hurt I may have caused, I fully accept responsibility for my action. I now realize that all words have power especially when they are chosen to make a statement. I sincerely hope that anyone offended by my words will forgive me for not recognizing this sooner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-23/entertainment/ca-16138_1_michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">LA Times article on the June 22, 1995 re-record announcement</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson first announced his decision to re-record &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us,&quot; the controversial song off his new &quot;HIStory&quot; album, with a phone call to Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd. The conversation appeared in Thursday&#39;s edition of the trade publication.</span></p><p class="csA117C4CA"><span><img src="Spring%201994%20-%20_They%20Don_t%20Care%20About%20Us__files/image0.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Haven&#39;t you ever done something that you wish you had never done? I do. So, now I&#39;ll change it,&quot; Jackson told Archerd.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson plans on going into the studio early next week to overdub new lyrics in the song. He told Archerd he will probably change the lyrics to &quot;strike me&quot; for &quot;kike me&quot; and &quot;Do me&quot; for &quot;Jew me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;As soon as he realized the extent to which those lyrics might hurt people, Michael decided to do this,&quot; Sandy Gallin, Jackson&#39;s manager, said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A spokesperson for Epic Records estimated that 2 million copies of &quot;HIStory&quot; are already in retail stores or on their way, but any copies after that will either have the new version of the song or a prominently placed explanatory sticker added to the packaging. She said it is uncertain how long it will take to add the new version of &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot; to pressings of the disc.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a statement issued Thursday, Epic Records said it stands by Jackson&#39;s decision.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gallin said Jackson told Epic he wants it to do &quot;everything humanly possible to put new versions of the song on the album.&quot; He also wanted to emphasize that the decision was not made due to concern over possible lackluster sales of the album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said he is pleased with Jackson&#39;s decision to change the lyrics, but he feels it&#39;s too little, too late.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;ve always believed Michael&#39;s claim that he did not want to hurt anyone, but those lyrics never should have seen the light of day,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;Out of all the people that heard the record before it came out, somebody should have stopped it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gallin was one of those people who heard the record and Jackson&#39;s manager said that even though he is Jewish, he did not know the ramifications of the slur.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I personally had no idea. It has not been in use for many, many years, and was not something that children would recognize as racism. The mere usage of the word, of bringing it back, is the essence of where the mistake was,&quot; Gallin said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In his Daily Variety comments, Jackson told Archerd that many of the Jewish associates he cites as close friends heard the song &quot;over and over.&quot;</span></p><p class="csA117C4CA"><span><img src="Spring%201994%20-%20_They%20Don_t%20Care%20About%20Us__files/image1.gif" width="1" height="1" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span><span class="csD5D7D290">Archerd, who was unavailable for comment Thursday, had adamantly criticized &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot; in his column. Gallin says Jackson called Archerd because Archerd had also made many phone calls to try to persuade Jackson to change the lyrics.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael saw that the [explanatory sticker] might not be enough, and that people might still get hurt. That&#39;s all he needed to prompt him to do this,&quot; Gallin said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-06-22/news/9506230081_1_michael-jackson-lyrics-daily-variety-columnist"><span class="cs8567212B">Chicago Tribune article on the June 22, 1995 re-record announcement</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd, in Thursday&#39;s editions, quoted Jackson as saying, &quot;I&#39;ll go into the studio next week and change (the lyrics). I thought of, first, muffling them, but that would make them even more noticeable.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The substitute phrases, Archerd reported, would be &quot;Strike me&quot; and &quot;Do me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mike Smallcombe, Making Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inspired by seeing the world, Michael had been writing songs while spending time at his ranch after the Bad Tour. Forger said Michael returned from his tour with certain impressions. &ldquo;His social commentary kicked up a notch or two,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Most of the early songs we worked on were more socially conscious. His consciousness of the planet was much more to the forefront.&rdquo; The most prominent of these were later titled &lsquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rsquo; and &lsquo;Earth Song&rsquo;. Michael and Forger began working on these tracks in Westlake&rsquo;s Studio C on Santa Monica Boulevard in June 1989.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Soon after starting work on &lsquo;Stranger in Moscow&rsquo; Michael resurrected &lsquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rsquo;, a protest song from the Dangerous sessions. Michael liked some of the unfinished songs from those sessions and wanted to complete them. &ldquo;Although the idea for this song existed from the earlier sessions, I think Michael and Matt Forger started on the song again from scratch,&rdquo; Rob Hoffman said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hoffman may have joined the team as an engineer, but he soon found himself playing instruments. Michael liked the song &lsquo;Owner of a Lonely Heart&rsquo; by Yes, so when the rock band came to New York, guitarist Trevor Rabin was invited to the studio to play on &lsquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rsquo;. &ldquo;We had many programmers and guitarists come in and play the main bridge guitar riff, including Trevor, Slash and Jeff Bova,&rdquo; Hoffman said. &ldquo;After Trevor and Slash played their parts, someone came in and said they played the wrong notes on the riff, so they got me to replay it. I prayed they would keep my take, and they did. That was my first ever guitar credit, on a Michael Jackson record!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bryan Loren, percussion/guitar/collaborator, &quot;Myspace&rdquo; blog post (July 11, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090727074255/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=88303946&amp;blogId=499755882"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us] was a song that he&rsquo;d started even before I joined him for &#39;Dangerous&#39;.
