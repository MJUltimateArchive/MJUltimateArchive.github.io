Eight- year-old Randy Jackson, playing conga drums, joined his brothers for the. first time, in the 45-minute show which Jackie Jackson described as &quot;one of the most rewarding&quot; performances we have ever given.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The blind children had learned the lyrics to the string of performed J-5 hits, and were prepared for the show, which for the most part, turned into a sing-a-long. Their enthusiasm differed in no way from that of any other J-5 audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Perhaps the most mutually rewarding part of the evening came at the end of the performance when, for the first time since the J-5 made their overwhelming debut into the world of show business, almost three years ago, the group was able to chat and shake hands with youngsters in the audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Christmas concert was the first of two appearances that the J-5 will make for the underprivileged children this holiday season. The Motown recording artists, dressed as Santa Clauses, will distribute Christmas presents at a Motown Christmas party on Wednesday.</span></p></body>
