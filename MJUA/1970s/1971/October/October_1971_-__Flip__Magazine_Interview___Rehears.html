How would you like to go to a very private rehearsal by the Jackson 5?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, come on! They usually rehearse out at their house in the San Fernando Valley, and that&#39;s where we&#39;re heading today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As we approach the gate we have to stop and push the button on the microphone next to the gate. Soon someone comes on and asks us to identify ourselves. We tell them who we are--they&#39;re expecting us--and they ask us to wait a second until they can catch Lobo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lobo is their enormous guard dog who really is rather dangerous to anyone he doesn&#39;t know. When anyone comes they have to catch him and lock him up before they unlock the gate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Soon the gate swings open and here we are--at the home of the Jackson 5 and most of their huge family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The area they use for rehearsing is out back behind the house. Be careful as you move around. There are construction crews working everywhere. There&#39;s a soda fountain being built over there and another kitchen way over there, so be careful and don&#39;t trip over any stray pieces of lumber.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Goodness, it&#39;s very quiet out here. Do you suppose they&#39;re not going to rehearse today? Well, let&rsquo;s go in and see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ah, there&#39;s the answer to the quietness--they&#39;re all sitting around and reading--the latest issue of FLIP, naturally. The Jackson 5 were the first all black group to be on FLIP&#39;s cover, and they are mighty proud of it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is really engrossed tn his copy of the magazine. He looks up and sees we&#39;re here and tells us &quot;I&#39;ve been reading FLIP for years&quot;, which is pretty funny since he&#39;s only l2 years old.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon and Tito are both quietly flipping through the magazine, while Jermaine is laughing at something funny he&#39;s found in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Jackie&quot;, says the oldest of the group as he suggests to the group that maybe they should put the magazines down for a while and get back to rehearsing. Jermaine and Tito pick up their guitars as Michael makes a dive for his tambourine and we settle down on the bench.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Soon the air is filled with the sound of softly played guitars and the marvelous blending of the voices of the Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As we sit and watch enthralled you begin to notice little things, like the way Jackie closes his eyes when he sings and the way Michael always seems to be in motion and especially the way that everything that Jermaine does comes out sexy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You notice, too, that Tito and Marlon seem to be the quietest ones in the group. Tito usually looks like he knows a secret that no one else knows and Marlon always seems to be watching everything that goes on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But before you know it the afternoon is almost gone and the rehearsal is over. It&#39;s time to leave.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s sad leaving, but as each guy shakes your hand and says goodbye you know that you&#39;ll never forget the day you went to a Jackson Five rehearsal.</span></p></body>
