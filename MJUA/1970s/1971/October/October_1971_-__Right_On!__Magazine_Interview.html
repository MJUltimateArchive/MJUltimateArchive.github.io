Michael Jackson is perhaps the most important vocalist in the Jackson Five. Almost all of the group&#39;s songs feature seventy-ﬁve-pound Michael singing lead. Michael is a fan too... Michael might he the star vocalist in the group as far as his fans are concerned. But he too is a fan who digs a number of star performers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;d like to he an actor.&quot; said Michael, &quot;like the kinds of things Sidney Poitier does. &quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sidney Poitier has been Michael&#39;s favorite actor since before he can even remember. The first time he ever really stopped and said, &quot;That man&#39;s got it!&quot; was during a television screening of Blackboard Jungle. Poitier played a student in a particularly rough high school in that film, a bitter ghetto black named Miller who eventually became the unifying force between the rebellious students and a teacher played by Glenn Ford.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Sidney was terrific...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Sidney was terrific in Blackboard jungle,&quot; said Michael. &quot;The first time I saw that picture I knew he was tops in my book. I watch the movie every time it&#39;s on TV. I guess the character he played is so much like people I&#39;ve known in my life. Maybe that&#39;s why his acting so appealed to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson never misses a Sidney Poitier film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Being a skilled impressionist, Michael does imitations of Poitier. He has memorized many lines from Blackboard Jungle, Lilies of the Field, and other Poitier films and loves to say them to anyone who&#39;ll listen. His brothers hope that the voice of Sidney Poitier doesn&#39;t mysteriously turn up in the lead on one of their rounds.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When you are a versatile as Michael Jackson, it is understandable that many types at music are appealing. While he digs the music of the Jackson Five most of all, he has other favorite types of music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I like classical music and soft listening music.&quot; he said. &quot;Not just rock.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Digs Johnny Mathis</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Naturally the composers of classical music have been gone for many years. But he does especially admire a certain singer of &quot;soft music.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Sometimes I sit and listen to singers like Johnny Mathis.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first time he had ever heard Mathis was on an old and scratchy single of &quot;Misty&quot;. There was something so relaxing in Mathis&#39; voice that came out over the scratches of the worn disc.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Before I began to develop my own style,&quot; he related, &quot;I wanted to sound just like Johnny. I had never heard such a smooth voice before. it made me want to put my feet up on a couch and just relax the rest of the afternoon. I wish he&#39;d do more singles work instead of just albums, television, and live performances.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Again, it doesn&#39;t take too much coaching to get Michael to do his imitation of Johnny Mathis. The voice is higher than the original, but the feeling is there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ray Charles: all-time favorite</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ray Charles is on almost everyone&#39;s list of all-time favorite singers. With Michael, Charles is way up there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I can&#39;t really say who I like better as a singer—Johnny Mathis or Ray Charles. Both are completely different in their styles. You just can&#39;t compare them. Each one is perfect in his own way.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was, in a way, through Johnny Mathis that Michael really began to dig Ray Charles. On one of those days that he didn&#39;t have to rehearse. Michael decided to just relax and put on some soft music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides listening to the usual Mathis ballads, he heard a record slipped on by one of his brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The record was Ray Charles&#39; &quot;I Can&#39;t Stop Loving You.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Who is that?&quot; said Michael, his round face broadening with a smile as he sat up straight on the couch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When told it was Ray Charles, he knew he had &quot;discovered&quot; a tremendous talent that had always been there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Play that again&quot;, he said, listening to the record for more times than he cared to count.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael digs all of Charles&#39; music, whether it be something slow and easy, or something like the classic &quot;What&#39;d I Say ?&quot;. When it comes to singing from the heart—from the soul—Johnny Mathis and Ray Charles rate top honors with Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three Dog Night...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Michael has been primarily involved with soul music and black singers and musicians, his love of popular music does not end there. To be versatile, he says, you most be exposed to all types of pop music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Therefore, third on his list of favorite pop musical acts is a white group, Three Dog Night. &quot;Maybe I like Three Dog Night most of all. l listen to them most of the time. I met them for the first time when we were at the Forum. They were all such great people and their group really got along well with ours.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was a fan of Three Dog Night ever since their first hits. The more records that come from that group, the more the young Jackson digs them. &quot;It seems like everything they do is better than what they did before&quot;, he said. &quot;I just about flipped when I heard &#39;Mama Told Me Not to Come&#39; for the first time. I sat there by the radio for forty-five minutes before the disc jockey played it again. Talk about White Soul, Three Dog Night sure has it!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sometimes at rehearsals, Michael Jackson coaxes his brothers into a certain rhythm and chord progression, not telling them what he&#39;s up to (if they haven&#39;t already guessed). Then he&#39;ll grab the microphone and start singing the lead to a song like &quot;Joy to the World&quot;. Or else, while the group is jamming, he&#39;ll lead them into a very long version of &quot;What&#39;d I Say?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No one really minds. They all enjoy seeing their brother perform and listening to him imitate the voices of other singers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sidney Poitier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Johnny Mathis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ray Charles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three Dog Night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There&#39;s not much more I can say about them&quot;, said Michael. &quot;Everyone knows how great they are. Nothing more has to be said.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shaking his head as if trying to unlock some buried thoughts, Michael&#39;s round eyes flash.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just dig them!&quot;</span></p></body>
