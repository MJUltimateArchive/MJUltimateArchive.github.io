They visited 40 cities in 60 days, playing concerts that attracted as many as 160,000 people (Milwaukee). The tour of The Jackson Five started in New York&rsquo;s Madison Square Garden July 15 and will end in Honolulu Sept. 13. The following day the boys will have to be in school.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Five stopped at home for a brief visit between concerts. No rest for them, however. They had to report to Columbia studio for the filming of a breakfast-food commercial which will appear on their ABC special Sept. 19. Also their Saturday morning ABC cartoon show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If they were weary, they didn&rsquo;t show it. They had performed to a sellout crowd at the Hollywood Bowl the night before, but still had enough energy to bounce through the commercial and ride their bikes around the Columbia lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The tour has been a whole lot of fun,&rdquo; said Jermaine, 16. &quot;We&rsquo;ve seen a lot of cities and we&#39;ve been to a lot of historical places. That&rsquo;s a good way to learn about history.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine is often the spokesman for the Jacksons. Others in the troupe are Jackie, 20; Tito, 17; Marlon, 14 and Michael, who was 12 on Sunday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They are five of the nine children of a Gary, Ind., crane operator and part time songwriter. Joe Jackson played guitar, and his wife sang country and western with a hint of blues. They infused their sons with a love of music, and the boys started playing as a group I when Michael was 4.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five&rsquo;s second single for Motown Records, &quot;ABC&quot;, soared over a million a records. Last year Billboard magazine, the oracle of the record industry, pronounced the lads No. 1 in sales of singles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They seem to enjoy their careers immensely. But being rock superstars can also generate problems.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When we moved to LA. a couple of years ago, we tried going to public schools,&quot; said Jermaine. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t work. The other kids would come around and peep into our classrooms. When we got out of class, we&#39;d be surrounded by kids, and we&rsquo;d be late to our next periods.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Kids would come from other schools just to get a look at us. It got to be a real problem for the schools. And we couldn&rsquo;t have much of a normal school life ourselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another problem was leaving school for concert dates. The boys take off for long weekends about three times each semester, and the Los Angeles City School system wouldn&#39;t allow it, even though a tutor accompanied them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next month four of the boys will enroll at the private Walton School in Panorama City, a few miles from their San Fernando Valley home in Encino. Brother Jackie is going to business school.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The chief drawback of a private school, said Jermaine: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get to see many girls.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite such deprivation and even though their summer vacation has been spent on the road, the Jacksons seemed to be enjoying their careers. &ldquo;We plan to stay in it as long as we can,&rdquo; Jermaine remarked.</span></p></body>
