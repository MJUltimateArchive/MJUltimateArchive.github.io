		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Los Angeles, California (The Jackson 5 Second National Tour)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Soul&rdquo; Magazine (October 11, 1971)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shattering the Beatles&#39; amazing concert records is no easy task, as a matter of fact, no group had ever done it before, but the super-human Jackson Five accomplished that task within the first twelve of their forty-city summer concert tour and went on for the remainder of the 60 day expedition to draw over 750,000 people who spent more than 2.5 million dollars to see their favorite Five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tour was a rapid succession of vast auditoriums, hotel rooms and airports, with the family group often spending more time on planes between cities than in the towns themselves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The trek began in July at New York&#39;s Madison Square Garden where hungry fans were unable to control their love for the group, causing the show to be halted several times during the evening. Washington D.C. audiences two days later had heard of the confusion in New York, and were much more sedate, a condition which prevailed over most of the rest of the country. By the time the boys reached Hawaii, in September, they had performed 50 shows and were able to make Michael&#39;s goal a reality. Before leaving on the tour, Michael stated, &quot;I hope this year we can finish a show before the audience chases us off stage, we have a real good ending and I want people to see it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Los Angeles, at least, fans did see the end of the show, which was held at the large, open-air Hollywood Bowl. The night of August 26, was warm and clear, and the air was filled with electric excitement as 17,256 young fans greeted the Commodores and Yvonne Fair with relative cool.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Commodores performed a series of tunes in the tradition, even they style, of the BarKays, whose act they had seen many times in Tuskegee. The group is young, and dynamic on stage, but if they had put as much energy into &quot;Blowing minds&quot; and as they did into telling the audience that hey would be doing some mind-blowing, they might have accomplished just that. Instead they left their listeners in a state of suspended anxiety, awaiting a spectacular demonstration of their talent which never came. Yvonne Fair is a fair singer whose costume did nothing for her stocky figure. Her choreography, consisting of high kicks, and bumps and grinds was certainly not keeping with the young, aware atmosphere of the J-5, and coupled with her unflattering outfit, left a good deal to be desired in the area of presenting an attractive female image.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Stand&quot; and Be Loved</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few words from local DJ Johnny Soul and the Jacksons ran on stage singing and playing &quot;Stand&quot;, they delivered every number they did with fast-paced choreography and filled the large stage with the brilliance and dazzle of their costumes. Cousins Johnny Jackson and Ronnie Rancifer were seldom featured on solos (although many fans feel they should be given this opportunity since there are only the two of them), but Ronnie did get a chance to show off his dancing ability during a dance challenge between the members of the group.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the audience, Papa Joe Jackson, Randy, and the rest of the Jackson family, Motowners (including Diana&#39;s Brother Chico in a striped poncho against the night chill) all showed up lookin&#39; ha-ard for this year&#39;s J-5 concert in their home town. Joe glanced about the audience frequently to check out the house and see if the fans were enjoying themselves, but most of the time he seemed not to be able to keep his eyes off. the whirling dynamo of talent that is his major source of pride up on the stage. And they showed-out proudly too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The most distinctive on stage were Marlon, and Michael. Jackie delivered some good lines and a commercial plug for their upcoming TV shows (even though he was a tiny bit hoarse) and Tito held his own on a couple of hip guitar solos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the highlights of the evening came when Jermaine dedicated a solo to &quot;Hazel for her Birthday&quot; (yes, girls, it is Hazel Gordy, daughter of the Motown President). He sang &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, but for some reason did not receive the usual response his solos generate, perhaps the girls were amazed at his honesty... or perhaps they were just jealous, but whatever it was, they were certainly not overly-enthused about his admitting to a friendship with the young lady.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The show proceeded with the usual piercing screams, cheers, and applause, but the stage was not rushed. AMong the tunes the Jackson sang were &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;Feelin&#39; Alright&quot;, and &quot;Who&#39;s Lovin&#39; You&quot;. Michael&#39;s solos, as usual were the essence of professionalism and soulful renderings. His feeling for lyrics has improved, if that&#39;s possible, with his maturity (becoming 13 only three days later) and his body movements are completely free and natural.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Dancer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon is definitely the dancer of the group and his fluidity on stage is a joy to observe. His is the most reserved of the group when it comes to singing, but he has a control and a poise when he is executing his dance routines that could teach Fred Astaire a thing or two.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As a whole the group has a much more natural appearance on stage than any other group around today. There is a carefully planned pattern to their act, but the planning doesn&#39;t show, only the results of it, a smoothly flowing, relaxed enjoyment of the music and the routines [of] the performers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Security began to be a problem when, toward the end of the one-hour-and-ten minute show, &nbsp;some fans came down to the front of the stage, but several large (possibly football players) official-looking young men rose up. On the edge of the stage and three feet away from the ground remained calm while the Jacksons finished their show to the last note and exited the stage without incident.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The last leg of the tour consisted of two shows, Hawaii, which brought the Jacksons back to Los Angeles just in time for school to start.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the end of the tour, Michael summed it all up by saying, &quot;I really dog traveling, but i can be a drag sometimes. There were sometimes when I wished I was home--even in school. But moving around the country like that, we did get a chance to see how our fans really feel about us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Loving the Pace</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie really like the fast-paced moving around, &quot;I know it sounds like it could get next to you after a while, but we really dig it. And we have the advantage of being a family that thinks and works very well together, We know what our job is, and we get our attitude together and take care of business.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Once in a while one of the younger ones in the group may go off into a a little adolescent funk&quot;, continues the 20-year-old &quot;Old Man&quot; of the J-5, but it doesn&#39;t take much to regroup them and get them back into the groove.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the entire tour the boys had very little time to themselves, but Tito found a few moments to add to his photo collection. Ever since the group&#39;s road manager, Tony James, gave him a camera last year. Tito has been studying photography in school and developing and printing as well. During the summer he has been building a photo album of pictures of his brothers and their career activities.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A Special Highlight</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another highlight of the summer was the Soulmate Contest where five lucky lucky young girls from around the country were selected to join the Jackson Five at a welcome-home party at their Encino home. The party will be held just prior to the airing of the &quot;Goin&#39; Back to Indiana&quot;, which was taped right before the tour began. The special, which airs September 19, features the J-5 singing and doing comedy skits with Bill Cosby, Tommy Smothers and Bobby Darin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three of the group were able to drive to and from the studios during the filming. Jermaine has gotten his learner&#39;s permit during the summer, while Tito has been driving since his 16th birthday and Jackie got a Datsun 240-Z fastback, on his 20th birthday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ABC TV was so impressed with the J-5 special that they are considering a hour-long documentary on the show and will use the letters they receive as a gauge, to help them make a decision about another show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Also on this summer&#39;s tour, The Jacksons&#39; recorded their next album which will be a live concert album. When they return to Los Angeles and get back in the routine of school, they will also be back in the routine of the studio. Motown producers and arrangers are already working out tunes and approaches to them for their next studio album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie will also be returning to school this year, he took a break for about a year after high school, but he is more determined than ever to enter business college this fall.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The J-5 cartoon series will also air this fall and will feature the boys&#39; singing voices, but for the spoken parts, five Black child actors will be used. One reason for this was the restrictions on the amount of time youngsters are allowed by law to work... the Jacksons would rather spend that time singing. The other reason was to give some other people talented young people a chance to make a little bread while they learn an acting skill.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The children who were chosen are all Black and were all students planning careers in acting. The cartoon series will air Saturday mornings beginning September, and will continue throughout the season.</span></p></body>
