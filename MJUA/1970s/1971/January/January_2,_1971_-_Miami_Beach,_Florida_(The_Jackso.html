How could I forget it?&quot;, exclaimed Lionel Richie, when asked if he remembered what it was like on that first Jackson Five/Commodores tour, when both acts were relatively unknown. &quot;Here were five kids--five *little* kids and we, the Commodores, were to tour the country as their opening act. The Commodores held a group meeting right before we went on stage that first night, and we all decided that these little kids were really nice and we didn&#39;t want to hurt their feelings, so we decided to hold hack a little on our show. You know, not blow away the audience because we knew we were a hard act to follow. &#39;Give the little guys a chance&#39;, we said. Then, after our performance, we watched from the wings and from that night on, through the rest of the tour, we had to pull out all the stops just to keep up with them. They were incredible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;I miss those old days&quot;, admitted Lionel Richie, &quot;when we were touring with The Jackson Five. Those were the days. Talk about fun? We&#39;d pull pranks on each other late at night in the hotel rooms. We had food fights and poor Bob Jones, the Director of Press and Publicity at Motown, we drove him crazy. But he had fun, too. It was so much simpler then. The demands on your time weren&#39;t as great, and you didn&#39;t feel the pressure. I don&#39;t know how they (The Jacksons) feel, but personally, I sort of miss the old days.&quot;</span></p></body>
