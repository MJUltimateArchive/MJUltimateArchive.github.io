		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Columbus, Ohio (The Jackson 5 Second National Tour)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-jackson-5-19710429"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone, 1971</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Backstage at Veteran Memorial Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio, maybe 15 seconds before the call to go on stage, and Michael Jackson is making a request to Tito, who&#39;s diddling away on his electric guitar, still plugged into the portable amp. &quot;Play Brenda and the Tabulations&#39; song,&quot; he pleads. Tito, his serious face defiant beyond its 17 years, continue on the &#39;blues riff he&#39;s found, &#39;way down at the bottom of the neck. Jermaine, on bass, is playing along, singing in his new falsetto:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">It&#39;s a sha-a-ame...the way you hurt me, Sha-a-ame...ooh-ooh-ooh...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael seems restless. He&#39;s posed with his brothers for the local black paper&ndash;that&#39;s become a dressing room ritual now&ndash;and he&#39;s done his vocal exercise, hitting the high notes in little burps while Jermaine is matching him on bass guitar. Now he&#39;s hungry again as 9:30 p.m. approaches, and he asks Jack Nance, the road manager, for some food&ndash;especially a hot dog. Too late by a second; a man steps into the room and calls, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Out in the corridor, you can hear cousins Ronnie Rancifer and Johnny Jackson on electric piano and drums driving into the first of a dozen repeating bars to introduce &quot;Stand.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Time to face 4,000 shrieks, and there is this remarkable lack of tension. The Jackson 5 could be paperboys going off to do their routes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before the first show, Michael poked around the dull, well-lit room in his stage outfit&ndash;part Afro sharp, part nursery school, orange top with little green turtles the design, and a toga-style shoulder cape. He drummed sticks onto a copy of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Rolling Stone</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> on the table facing the mirror, pouring a steady rain of wood onto James Taylor&#39;s glaring face, until Marlon grabbed the magazine. He poked around some more; reminded cousin Ronnie to remember his cue list of songs; watched people come and go. He is not a center of attention. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; and by the time the cousins hit the &quot;Stand&quot; riff for the twelfth time, the Jackson 5 are up the ramp, past the columns of curtains and the first wave of screams, and lined up&ndash;tall Jackie in the center, Tito and Jermaine, behind their guitars, alongside, and Marlon and Michael on the wingtips. On a count, each puts one hand on the left hip, the other hand lightly cupping the right ear, and gets the right leg stomping, highstep style&ndash;all, of course, in unison, until Michael breaks away to take the mike and put his own voice above the screams.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One talk with Joe Jackson and you&#39;re sprung back two musical generations, back past the beginnings of rhythm and blues, to Chicago in 1951, when bebop and blues were the music staples of the black man. In the Forties, white musicians had turned jazz into a tepid &quot;swing&quot;; the answer, in the black urban areas, was &quot;hard&quot; bebop, mixing the hard-edged city blues style, reflecting the migration of Negroes to the north and Midwest, with the big band sound popular in the Southwest&ndash;in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Oklahoma.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe Jackson was one of the migrant blacks, settling into steel town to work and raise a family. He worked as a crane operator, &quot;but I always wanted to be in entertainment.&quot; On weekends, he sang and played guitar with one of the many groups that called themselves the Falcons. &quot;It was a local group out of Chicago, around 1951,&quot; he said. &quot;We played mostly colleges and things&ndash;bars. It was a blues thing, which is what everybody was getting into.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But he had to keep working to support his fast-growing family. &quot;The boys would listen to the things we were trying to do, at rehearsals, and there were always instruments laying around. If you&#39;re around something a lot, you&#39;re gonna take part in it.&quot; Soon, Mr. Jackson faded away from the Falcons scene and turned the house over to his sons&#39; music. &quot;We went overboard. My wife and I would fight, because I invested in new instruments that cost so much. When a woman&#39;s a good mother and finds all the money going into instruments, she doesn&#39;t like it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Things worked out, obviously. As Bob Jones, a publicist at Motown, explained, &quot;The average black family living off a menial job can be as well off as a middle class white family. You eat collard greens and chitlins, and you can take a penny and stretch it out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Papa Joe went out and scouted other groups, bringing back ideas on how to choreograph his sons. &quot;It always looked good; the little ones on the side and the tall one in the center. And their voices blend well because of the family thing. There&#39;s a basic tone quality that&#39;s common to all of them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First, it was the three oldest sons, with Jermaine singing lead. Two sisters, Maureen (the oldest of the Jackson children) and Latoya, played violin and clarinet (the instrument Mrs. Jackson played) outside the group. Shortly after Marlon and Michael joined, the group won a talent show at Roosevelt High and, the next two years, won regional talent competitions. And the rest is in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Soul </span><span class="csD5D7D290">magazine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Oh, yes. There&#39;s Randy, 8, who plays congas and is just about ready to make it the Jackson 6. And Janet, 4, in the wings, still learning words.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What happens at Motown, in the studios? Motown acts usually won&#39;t talk about record production, as if some conspiracy transpires in secret rooms in Detroit and Hollywood. Few people know who actually decides what songs, what producers, what musicians make up &quot;The Sound of Young America.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I mean, when I heard the first several Jackson 5 singles on the radio&ndash;&quot;I Want You Back,&quot; &quot;ABC,&quot; and &quot;One More Chance&quot;&ndash;I had thought, crazy; Diana Ross and the Family Stone. All the albums are gems. On the first, Michael turns Smokey&#39;s &quot;Who&#39;s Loving You&quot; into a noodly little blues number; on the second, he leaves his band and orchestra behind on the Stevie Wonder tune, &quot;Don&#39;t Know Why I Love You.&quot; Michael is causing heartbreaks while the Osmonds are still learning the ABC&#39;s of white-skinned soul. And all the albums are planned, Motown&#39;s publicist says, with the black market in mind. &quot;We try and have at least two hits on every album.&quot; The third album includes &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;Mama&#39;s Pearl,&quot; which was re-mixed for its release as a single. Now, Michael&#39;s in the studios with his producer, working on his tracks for the next album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From what Joe Jackson says, the deal with the Jackson 5 apparently works like this: He has raised, trained, and furnished them; Motown will now do the rest. For example: &quot;What is your role in the studio?&quot; &quot;My role is getting the boys out to the studios. I&#39;m the legal guardian. They listen to me 100 percent.&quot; There is, however, a road manager from Dick Clark Productions and a young Motown employee, Suzanne DePasse, handling choreography and selection of stage numbers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Who writes the songs?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve written some songs, the boys have written some.&quot; But none of them have yet been recorded, and many of the tunes on the three albums (not counting the Christmas record) are by &quot;The Corporation,&quot; who is credited as arrangers and producers, along with Hal Davis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Who&#39;re they? &quot;The Corporation,&quot; Jackson says, &quot;is the company itself&ndash;people, producers within Motown. They&#39;re called &#39;the clan&#39; back in Detroit.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here in the suite the Jackson 5 are using for a parlor at their hotel in Columbus, the most noise is being made by several men, white men; the Jackson 5 are scattered among a couple of suites on the floor (where, by the elevator, two security guards keep watch for persistent fans). A couple of them are playing cards; nearby sit partially-drunk glasses of milk and a bucket of the remains of fried chicken. There is hard liquor, but it&#39;s being guzzled by the various promoters hanging around. Joe Jackson, watching the card game, remains quiet, except to help herd his sons over to talk. They do interviews like most boys get their hair cut, worried if they move their mouth the wrong way they&#39;ll get nicked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But they are as uniformly amiable as they are bashful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie, 19, talks about going into business school with an eye to &quot;maybe take care of the financial part of the group someday.&quot; For now, &quot;all I do is enjoy what I do on stage. It&#39;s something like a hobby.&quot; Tito, 17, is more into music (Jackie dropped out of a high school music course and is learning to read charts now from Jermaine, Tito, and cousin Ronnie). &quot;In the studios, I sing bass and play some lead guitar, and I&#39;m going into music theory.&quot; In school, he learned to play the violin, bass fiddle, and saxophone. And&ndash;pointing to himself, to credit himself as teacher&ndash;he can play some piano, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito is perhaps the most serious musician of the Jackson 5. He listens to Hendrix and BB King records. &quot;Ever since I started playing guitar, about three years ago. And I have one BB King record about as old as me. It&#39;s my father&#39;s.&quot; What about studio work? &quot;Sometimes we like to go, sometimes not... Repeating songs over and over&ndash;that&#39;s a drag, man. It&#39;s hard.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito shook his head slowly, like an old bluesman reminiscing, when I asked about the old days, seven years ago, when Michael first joined: &quot;It was hard. Money was short. It was a drag.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine Jackson, 16, laughs easily, with an open face and smile. Right after the initial introductions, while everybody else was watching TV or playing the card game Tonk, he walked over, looked at my cassette recorder, and asked, &quot;Wanna talk right now?&quot; And he sat against the headboard of a bed and told about school&ndash;how he and his brothers go to a private school in Encino, five classrooms and 29 students; how a tutor, assigned by the state board of education, follows them on their short tours to keep them doing schoolwork.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine played bass on a guitar before getting a bass guitar. &quot;I started guitar at 11, before we became professional. That&#39;s when I was 14.&quot; Next, Jermaine wants to learn piano. And he&#39;s writing songs&ndash;&quot;all kinds; a lot of short songs. I&#39;ve got some saved up... for when we go bankrupt.&quot; I asked Jermaine to name me some of his favorite artists, people I wouldn&#39;t guess (like the Motown acts). He smiled. &quot;Barbra Streisand&hellip;and Bread. Three Dog Night. I met them at the Forum when we were there.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon, 13, is considered the quietest of the Jackson 5. On stage, Michael has the spotlight, but Marlon is as visible as any corner of a polished diamond. Those smooth moves he and his brothers execute while Michael works the front lines&ndash;left hand up, right arm and hand joining left, both arms slashed diagonally past the hip; a spin and a grab of the mike stand with one hand, taking it down to knee level and singing into it&ndash;Marlon looks the best at it. Vocally, his singing goes into the harmonic mix&ndash;he sings no leads&ndash;but once in a while, you hear him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a rousing &quot;Goin&#39; Back to Indiana,&quot; while the electric piano and drums and Michael swirl to a finish, Marlon stays at his mike and lets out three happy whoops. At home, Marlon shares a room with Michael and Randy, and they play basketball and pool and swim. Marlon likes to watch cartoons Saturday mornings with Michael, and, like Mike, he&#39;s thinking of an acting career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At home they take turns cleaning rooms and washing dishes; backstage and in hotel rooms they sing and play cards and fight and generally ignore the adults; in public they are clean-cut, cordial and unassuming. There really are no secrets. Tito looks the toughest, so, over a sandwich at the coffee shop in Chicago&#39;s airport, I asked him about what the Jackson 5 were saying to kids&ndash;especially to black kids. Peace and freedom and unity, right? Or are you singing these songs just to entertain? Tito thought it over, worked an overload of lettuce into his mouth, and swallowed. &quot;Just to entertain,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(&quot;Just two things you gotta promise me,&quot; Bob Jones had said when we first approached Motown about a J-5 piece. &quot;No questions about drugs or politics. They aren&#39;t into that and we&#39;d just rather lay off it.&quot;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson is 11 years old, 75 pounds. And he&#39;s sung lead on almost all the Jackson 5&#39;s songs&ndash;six hit singles in 1970 (counting black and white surveys); three gold albums (plus a Christmas LP that is sure to play forever, like Bobby Helms&#39; &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; or Harry Simeone&#39;s &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;). And two hit singles so far this three-month-old year. It is not all that amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Five Stairsteps, who had &quot;Ooh Child&quot; last year, are a family act who were about the same age as the Jackson 5 when they began some five years ago; the Osmonds, even if now they&#39;re only duplicating the J-5 sound, were around and on TV back in 1963 on the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Andy Williams Show</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, when Donny first pitched his pipes into the Brothers&#39; barbershop sound. And, from Oakland, little Dion is a drummer, singer, and dancer who&#39;s been knocking around at clubs and lounges for several years now. He&#39;s nine years old today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Still, here you have the chief child, the new model, the successor to James Brown and the Tempts and Sly, the cherubic incarnation of their sum; of all the spirit that is meant when Brown does his all-out dance-sweat-and-relate act, when the Miracles or the Tops line up, all dressed alike, and do their black-is-beautiful drill team maneuvers, tall, proud, and smiling, sounding like rivulets of soul. Or when Sly and the Family Stone, five blacks and two whites, all outfitted different but funkadelic, come on stomping, raising you up, by flashes, to a feeling of exhilaration and to some synergistic sense, all of you there in your $5.50 seat section, of potential power and present glory.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Color, flash, and a Mayfield of messengers, drumming, pounding, screeching, blowing out the word. The Jackson 5 is this and more: They are peers. Stars, untouchable in their sleek black Fleetwood Cadillacs that roar off behind police escorts after all their shows. Yet peers, backstage in Gary, Indiana, looking for old friends to drop by.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of them sheepishly walks in, and Marlon and Michael brighten. The friend is dressed OK, but he&#39;s not in pink top and Indian rainbow-print slacks with puffballs down to the bottom of the bell, like Marlon. He&#39;s checking Marlon out, stands back a little, you know, but Marlon just wants to find out about all the old friends from grammar school, and they talk a little, hands reach out, slap, slap, and the friend leaves with a power salute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eight, 10-year-old kids in Columbus, Ohio, and Gary, Indiana, where we visited; in Los Angeles and San Francisco, where I work&ndash;they love and emulate the Jackson 5. There&#39;s a bit of fantasy&ndash;the kind of gush white teenies direct at Bobby Sherman or David Cassidy (of the TV Partridge Family). But there isn&#39;t that real distance. It is a style of clothing, for one thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pre-teen blacks are blossoming out in Afros and fringed bells and Apple hats. And it is different from that Hollywood notion of fashion for fad&#39;s sake; hot pants for a hot minute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is an approach to brothers and to others; in a way, a statement. It is a feeling of camaraderie, of the kind of spirit that bought Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young so close to so many last year; it is a feeling that, in white circles, might best be counter parted by Grand Funk and its &quot;brotherhood&quot; kind of magnetism. It is in the posters that the kids in Gary drew and cut out and painted for the J-5 contest. &quot;You can make it if you try.&quot; &quot;On Top with our Jackson 5.&quot; And it is in the songs&ndash;in the first album. &quot;Stand&quot; (There&#39;s a midget standing tall, and the giant beside him about to fall Stand/ stand/ stand); in the second, &quot;Make Way for the Young Folks.&quot; In the third, &quot;I&#39;m on your side, when things get rough and friends just can&#39;t be found, like a bridge over troubled water.&quot; On the Christmas album, along with the rousing &quot;I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,&quot; and the most soulful &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; ever, Michael sang an anti-war song. &quot;Someday at Christmas&quot; came on sounding like it might be another &quot;White Christmas,&quot; until the high, earnest voice sang out:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Someday at Christmas there won&#39;t be boys</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Playing with bombs like kids play with toys</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Like one December, our hearts will see</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A world where men are free</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Someday at Christmas there&#39;ll be no wars</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">When we have learned what</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Christmas is for</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">When we have found what life&#39;s really worth</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">There&#39;ll be peace on earth</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Brown says the same thing&ndash;sitting on a stool looking very gentlemanly on a TV talk show; Little Richard says the same thing, his upstretched arms and fingers forming three V-signs all together. So does Diana Ross. But it is different when Michael Jackson says it. He&#39;s not even a </span><span class="cs43C038A">grownup</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> yet, and he knows.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson, round eyes, round dimples on a round face, under a round Afro, has placed himself on a couch in the hotel suite and looks up, to indicate he&#39;s ready to be interviewed. He&#39;s done his two shows, and he&#39;s been relaxing&ndash;playing cards, doing card tricks, and waiting for the inevitable pillow fight. So his brown eyes dart around now and then, watching for the first move.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Backstage in Columbus that day&ndash;and he must&#39;ve heard this line a dozen times&ndash;when a columnist for the local black paper patted him paternally and tried: &quot;I heard you were really a midget, man, that you&#39;re actually 30 years old&quot;&ndash;Mike gave him this side-swipe smile, like </span><span class="cs43C038A">ha-ha, very original</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Michael began singing with his brothers when he turned four.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first show &quot;was a hospital we did. They had a big Santa Claus.&quot; Another early show was at the Big Top; it was a shopping center. &quot;We were doing it free so the people could hear the music.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, seven years later, Michael is playing drums and learning the piano. And, in the Motown studios in Hollywood, backed vocally by his brothers and instrumentally by the usual full crew of Motown session men, he sings lead. &quot;It takes me about two hours to do one whole song,&quot; he says. &quot;I do my part first, then they do theirs.&quot; The first songs Michael remembers singing were the Drifters&#39; &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; and the Isley Brothers&#39; &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; both from 1961.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, on stage, Michael does a talk bit about how he feels the blues. It is not convincing; the Jackson 5 are not great actors just yet. But, with their median age still 15, they have paid dues.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Before Motown,&quot; Mike recalled, &quot;we used to do five shows a night for theaters&quot; and clubs around Chicago and Gary where their youth was no barrier, doing the circuit with groups like the Emotions and the Chi-Lites.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons also worked in Missouri and Wisconsin, and even in Arizona once. They got there by bus. Michael joined his brothers when he turned four; soon he perfected a James Brown imitation and made it his routine. &quot;It was amazing,&quot; says Suzanne DePasse, who plans and coordinates the J-5&#39;s stage show. &quot;He had it down to a T&quot;&ndash;every twist, turn, jerk, and thrust.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And I had to work to get him away from a lot of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mike is a skilled mimic. He watches TV cartoons and can sketch profiles; now he wants to take art in college. &quot;Also I&#39;d like to be an actor, like the kinds of things Sidney Poitier does.&quot; And when I told Michael he was a good blues singer, he laughed. &quot;I learned by ear.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time Diana Ross introduced the Jackson 5 to her world&ndash;at the Daisy discotheque in Beverly Hills in September 1969&ndash;the group was reported to have &quot;a repertoire that ranges from Ray Charles to Liberace.&quot; </span><span class="cs43C038A">Soul</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> magazine didn&#39;t elaborate, but Michael, talking about his favorite kind of music, made it sound almost plausible. &quot;I like classical music,&quot; he said, &quot;and soft listening music. Sometimes I sit and listen to soft stuff like Johnny Mathis. I like Ray Charles. And most of the time, I listen to Three Dog Night.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And what about the screaming audiences? Jackson 5 did their first major tour last fall, hitting the big arenas&ndash;the Gardens in Boston, Cincinnati, and New York. They set an attendance record by drawing 12,275 to a show in Greensboro, North Carolina. They had a majestic triumph in home territory&ndash;at the Chicago Amphitheatre before 19,570. Kids fainted in Cincinnati and Boston, rushing through fences and human barriers to reach the stage. Michael Jackson, the understanding diplomat: &quot;If it weren&#39;t for the screaming, it wouldn&#39;t be exciting. The kids help us by being the way they are.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The black audience. At the Greek Theatre, summer 1970, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles are in mid-show, and they whip off their gold-sequined toreador jackets, all in one sweeping motion, and the kids are screaming, and Smokey moves from the monkey into a medley of the hits &ndash; &quot;Mirage,&quot; and &quot;Tracks of My Tears,&quot; and &quot;Emotion&quot;&ndash;and when it all ends, and they&#39;ve gone through all those movements&ndash;fluttering hands pointing to those tear-tracks, synchronized spins ending with arms stretched out in a &quot;safe&quot; sign, all that shit &ndash; the crowd goes: </span><span class="cs43C038A">YAAAAyyy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Three seconds, and it dies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I couldn&#39;t figure it out. Now, here are the Commodores, opening act on the J-5 show. They&#39;re a run-of-the-mill seven-man soul ensemble from Tuskegee, Alabama, where they all go to a, </span><span class="cs43C038A">ahem</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Negro college. Still, they can get down to it, working hard, doing all that Sly stuff. The drummer stretches out &quot;I&#39;m gonna add a little organ&quot; with rhetoric &amp; blues questions:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Would you like to hear my organ?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;</span><span class="cs43C038A">YAAAyyy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He jumps up and down on his wooden altar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;</span><span class="cs43C038A">YAAyy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You like that?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;YAAAy.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And at the end of it, when they&#39;ve sung the Edwin Starr song. &quot;War&quot; (Temptations style, of course), and gone through their Hollywood-transplant nightclub things like &quot;Wichita Lineman,&quot; and sung Sly&#39;s &quot;Higher,&quot; and flashed the perfunctory peace signs, when the MC from the soul station has loped onto the stage to yell their names over and over again: </span><span class="cs43C038A">YAAAyyy</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Three seconds.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Well,&quot; a black promoter explains after two Jackson 5 shows, &quot;the black audience participates so much more during the song. They&#39;re screaming and dancing and answering &ndash; it&#39;s like in church &ndash; so when the song ends, there ain&#39;t no more.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Church. Here comes the next warm-up, Yvonne Fair, charging out like a raging bull, short, stout, with large breasts snug against each other under a thin white outfit that goes down to her belly, where long white fringes take over and skitter all over her hot panties.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Women&#39;s libido. She earns 10, maybe 12 seconds of </span><span class="cs43C038A">yays</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> with &quot;25 Miles&quot; by Edwin Starr (Motown tunes get a lot of mileage out here on the road), &quot;Band of Gold,&quot; and, to give her a real chance to dance, &quot;Deeper and Deeper.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, &quot;Now, we get to the part of the show about the low-down, no-good me-en.&quot; A grandmother, teeny-sitting for the day, smiles. Younger sisters laugh and cheer, and, suddenly, it&#39;s Women&#39;s Lib, young/black/Columbus Ohio style, and you see the participation. Yvonne: &quot;This song is for like young ladies with men who have a habit of taking everything&ndash;we mean from clothes to money to... whatever.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She goes into &quot;Piece of My Heart.&quot; Then a break. She moves back and points to her stage-prop man, the Commodores&#39; lean young bass player. This is her property, she tells her audience. &quot;He&#39;s mine.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Teenage girl: You can have it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yvonne: He ain&#39;t much, but he&#39;s mine. [To bass man, heatedly:] You don&#39;t got to go show off!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Girl: He ain&#39;t got much to show!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yvonne: Pose more, honey, pose more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Girl: He&#39;s gonna have to pose a whole lot!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yvonne: What you see is what you get!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Girl (and friends): Right on!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Yvonne builds the song back up. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Take another little piece of my heart, baby.... Take another piece of this good thing, baby...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You can tell she&#39;d be a good match for James Brown in any battle of the lungs. By way of introduction, Yvonne Fair used to be a featured singer with James Brown&#39;s show, after her first days with the Chantels in the early Fifties, a break-up, a reunion, and a hit, &quot;Look in My Eyes,&quot; in 1961. She was with Brown from 1962 to 1965, when &quot;It got kind of wearing on my nerves.&quot; James Brown, she said&ndash;and she kept it short&ndash;is not the man he has made a lot of people think he is. She went off to join Chuck Jackson&#39;s revue, and, two years ago, signed with Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now she&#39;s going through the ropes again, traveling with Motown stars like the J-5, waiting patiently for some of that Motown Attention. She&#39;s just moved out to Hollywood, and she&#39;s hopeful. &quot;There are so many artists in Detroit that it was kinda hard to concentrate on me. What it is is the producers and writers over there; they automatically go to the big acts. They&#39;re the guaranteed sales. The smaller acts have to wait around for their turn.&quot; So what is this with the multiple entendres and the whirlpool-ass act? Isn&#39;t it...beyond the 6-, 8-, 10-year-olds who make up such a large part of the Jackson 5 audiences?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Not the kids of today. Their minds are more developed. You don&#39;t have to tell them garbage and be filthy about it.... I just suggest certain things; their minds are open to whatever. Kids know what it&#39;s all about, and they should be able to get pleasure out of their own imagination. If they didn&#39;t dig it, I could feel it. I&#39;m not advertising sex; the dances of today are sex.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As for the Jackson 5: &quot;They captivate you because Michael works the stage like an old professional. His riffs take an average singer a lifetime to learn. It&#39;s a group that lacks nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob Jones is talking about the cancellation of several Jackson 5 dates in Texas last year after protests over Dick Clark Productions, promoters of the tour. &quot;It was mainly because Clark went into areas and didn&#39;t do anything with the local [read &quot;Black&quot;] promoters. And they screamed about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;s eventually gonna give it up, I&#39;m sure, because he&#39;s lost Chicago, he&#39;s lost New York, and he&#39;s lost L.A.&quot; Jones is talking about disc jockeys who control markets&ndash;heavily.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You don&#39;t go into Chicago if you&#39;re a black act unless you&#39;re an E. Rodney Jones [WVON] promotion. Otherwise, forget it. And there&#39;s a key DJ in Atlanta...There are cities we cannot give him anymore, and all the major cities will be taken by some force&ndash;DJ, Operation Breadbasket, or whatever. And Clark will have only the Daytons and the Columbuses...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We are almost out of Columbus. At the airport, TWA gives the J-5 entourage a special waiting room, and that saves them from a couple dozen autographs each&ndash;which is not to say they mind giving them. It&#39;s become part of the routine. A thank-you here, a power-shake there, an autograph or two on these glossies, and hold it for just one picture, if you will. TWA brings in a tray-full of hamburgers and Cokes, and the J-5 get down to chomping and arguing&ndash;mostly about the water and pillow fight the night before. &quot;Suzanne, I saw you tripping someone last night,&quot; Michael says. &quot;It was everybody against everybody.&quot;</span></p></body>
