Marlon was the comedian of the group always making his brothers laugh. Michael enjoyed sharing their love of cartoons with Michael. Marlon liked taking things apart and putting them back together. He was a very good swimmer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said: &ldquo;I can only add that if he weren&rsquo;t my brother - I&rsquo;d want him to be my best friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine: If Jermaine was stuck on a desert island the three things he&rsquo;d wish for would be: Food, music and girls, and he&rsquo;s an expert on all three according to Michael. Jermaine got an A for cooking at school. His specialities were Mexican dishes and Italian. His own favourites though were soul food like hamhocks and corn bread. Michael said Jermaine was a favourite with the girls at school. He preferred natural girls, who were themselves. Jermaine liked sports like the roller derby and baseball.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito: &ldquo;Toriano Jackson is his real full name, but everyone called him &lsquo;Tony&rsquo; until he was about three years old. Then our dad nicknamed him &lsquo;Tito&rsquo;.&rdquo; Tito wanted to be a fireman until he fell in love with music. He loved art and clothes. Tito was interested in designing some of his own and brothers clothes, which he would for some J5 tours. Tito&rsquo;s hobbies included fitting model kits together. He once made a go cart from a lawn mower. On girls Michael said Tito likes warm and friendly ones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie: Michael says Jackie is the natural leader of the group and takes control of all the rehearsals. Jackie was a great athlete and could have been a professional had he not fell in love with music. He loves clothes, especially see through vests. His favourite musical artists include: Tom Jones, The Four Tops, Diana Ross and The Beatles. On his day off Michael says Jackie likes to be with a girl, either picnicking at Griffith Park or surfing at Santa Monica Beach.</span></p></body>
