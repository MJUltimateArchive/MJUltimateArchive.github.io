		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Interview with Gerry Fallon</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Interview with Gerry Fallon (1979)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last year one of his major ambitions fulfilled when he played a starring role in &quot;The Wiz&quot;, the all-black remake of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He played the brainless Scarecrow opposite Diana Ross as Dorothy. Critical acclaim was heaped on him from all sides and after his classy singing and dancing performance, he was inundated with many more film offers, including lots of musicals. Says Michael: &quot;I love the film, I loved making it, the things I learned! I just hated to end it! The fact that it was my first film didn&#39;t bother me at all, in fact a lot of the people involved were old friends anyway. Diana I&#39;ve known since I was seven years old. Being around with such brilliant people as Sidney Lumet, the director—just conversing with them you learn so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s a new challenge for me, another world. That&#39;s what I love about show business, you never run out of things to do. I always want to go on working all night, work myself to death.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Along with his music, of course, and even before &quot;The Wiz&quot;, films were Michael&#39;s great love. &quot;I adore films&quot;, he enthuses. &quot;I wish I could eat them, really. Sometimes I hate to face the reality of everyday life. There&#39;s a reality, of course, in films, but it&#39;s more of another life. Like playing the scarecrow, when I put on the costume, it wasn&#39;t me, it was another person. I look at him on the screen and I see another person. Oh, I hated it when they said, &#39;OK, curtain, time to go home&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But never fear, Michael is not going to neglect his singing. With the boom of Disco Music over the last few years, the Jacksons as a group have become even more popular with foot-tapping hits like &quot;Blame it on the Boogie&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&quot;, and an outstanding album, &quot;Destiny&quot;, while Michael&#39;s solo career is at this moment stronger than ever. Last year, his debut solo album &quot;Off the Wall&quot; was released and it is probably the best thing he&#39;s done to date. Michael says about &quot;Off the Wall&quot;: &quot;We had a ball making the album. It was the smoothest album I have ever been involved in. There was so much love, it was incredible. Everybody worked so easily.&quot; But even so, Michael has his own ideas about the disco scene: &quot;I know disco music is bigger than it&#39;s ever been, but I don&#39;t need discos to dance. I dance everywhere—especially around the house. It&#39;s always been like that with me. I remember when I was younger and used to watch the old Fred Astaire movies. Whatever he&#39;d do—like dancing on top of tables and up walls—I&#39;d imitate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;To tell the honest truth, I really don&#39;t like the term &#39;disco music&#39;, It&#39;s Rhythm and Blues music, and it&#39;s been going for years through stars like James Brown and Marvin Gaye. But I am really glad that people are dancing so much these days. Because it really does get rid of all your troubles.&quot;</span></p></body>
