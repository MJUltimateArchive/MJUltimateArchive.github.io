The shots ended up not making the cover because Jackson was unhappy with how he looked in them, [Colleen] Pollard [(his niece)] said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To loosen him up, McCrary asked his niece, then 18, to dance with Jackson. As they were about to start, Jackson&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough&quot; was playing on the radio but was not yet a hit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jim did not know Michael&#39;s music and changed the radio station,&quot; Pollard said. &quot;I yelled, &#39;No, that&#39;s his song.&#39; The looks on Michael&#39;s face and his manager&#39;s were priceless.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was a prime example of why McCrary soon left rock photography behind, Pollard recalled: &quot;He said he just didn&#39;t feel connected with the bands anymore.&quot;</span></p></body>
