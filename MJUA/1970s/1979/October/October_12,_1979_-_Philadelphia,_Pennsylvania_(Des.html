Can you each describe how you got your breaks as musicians?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Danny Sembello: &ldquo;[My brother] Michael was musical from an early age, but I wasn&rsquo;t as sure that the music business was the right place for me. It took me a little longer to realize that I wanted to make music. My cousin was playing with the Jackson 5 in Philly and he had invited them over for dinner before the show. Sitting around my cousin&rsquo;s table eating pasta, Michael [Jackson] began to egg me on saying that your brother bragged about how great of a keyboard player I was. I replied, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m actually a better basketball player but I&rsquo;ll play something if you want.&rdquo; So I played &ldquo;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)&rdquo;, then I segued into &ldquo;The Secret Life of Plants&rdquo;, a song I learned in the studio with my brother and Stevie Wonder. Michael became captivated with the melody and asked me to play it at least a half dozen times. Each time I played, Michael leaned a little further over the piano to watch my hands. That night was truly magical for me. The day Michael died my brother and I both lost a great friend and inspiration.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;Playing piano for Michael is a memory I never forget. Having him respond the way he did made me want to be a musician. It was the first time I felt I had inspired someone and witnessed first hand what music can do. Right after that, I graduated high school and then jumped on a plane to California to become a musician.</span></p></body>
