Every concert he does is sold out and to date the records he has made with his famous brothers have sold a staggering 65 million copies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He has been in the business a lifetime--16 long years. Yet he is only still a few months short of his golden twenty first birthday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And, despite all this, Michael is still as fresh faced and shy as the day he started. Other stars become big headed and bossy the minute they even get a sniff of fame. But not Michael!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I should know. Because I spent a whole week with Michael when he came to Britain recently. I told him of the best places to hang out, the best shops for clothes and the best sights to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he told me all about himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first hint I got of Michael&#39;s frailty was when I first met him in his posh, plush London hotel suite.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though the temperature inside was stifling, Michael was shivering like a baby. He walked over to the thermostat which controlled the heating in the room and turned it full up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But that was not enough. He still huddled into himself to try to keep warm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then he politely asked me if he could put on the jacket I had discarded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That made him feel happier and warmer and he kept it on during the whole interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At first Michael was reluctant to talk too much. But as he got to know me better and began to trust me he opened up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After that there was no stopping him. He just talked and talked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love what I&#39;m doing. Just love it&quot;, he told me. &quot;Being on stage is the place I feel happiest. I feel so relaxed there. All day I look forward to getting up there, and when I&#39;m on, I just don&#39;t want a performance to finish.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Dancing is a great way of spending time. I dance all day long. And I don&#39;t really need to go to discos to do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just love to do it at home. There&#39;s hardly a moment of the day when I&#39;m not moving around to a funky beat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Often I&#39;ll just go into my bedroom turn the record player up and just dance and dance. Before I know it the whole evening&#39;s gone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The dancing bug hit me early. I was really young when I began to be fascinated by the Fred Astaire movies. He was the great tap dancer of the thirties and forties. Perhaps the greatest dancer ever. And he became my idol.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Whatever dances he would do on film--like dancing on top of tables or up walls--I&#39;d copy. My parents had a hectic time with me then!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But, despite what people might assume, I&#39;m not a particularly clubby person. I might go to a disco now and again--I really love going to Studio 54--but, most of all, I love to stay home. And just have friends over and play records.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s innocence and freshness shows in many other ways too. He could have already gone out with hundreds of the girls who write to him day in, day out. But he has not. Instead, he confessed to me that he has only ever had a handful of dates in his whole life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He admits to often still being shy and embarrassed in front of girls.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But I love them,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#39;d love to meet the right girl and get married. But, at the moment, I can&#39;t, because there&#39;s so many things I&#39;ve got to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But I do really want to have children. I&#39;m planning on loads and loads when I get married.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The great thing about children is that they&#39;re not phony or prejudiced. Where-as grown-ups pretend a lot of the time.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s name has been recently linked with film star, Ryan O&#39;Neal&#39;s daughter, Tatum. But he says, &quot;We&#39;re really good friends. She&#39;s helped me a lot with my acting.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Acting is a new career that has suddenly blossomed for Michael, apart from his singing and dancing. Soon he is to be seen in the movie extravaganza &quot;The Wiz&quot;. It is a black, hip, up to date version of the old Hollywood musical, &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To many, Michael&#39;s performance has been the highlight of the movie. And he is being strongly tipped for an Oscar nomination.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the movie, Michael plays the scarecrow. It is a startling transformation from his everyday self.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The make-up alone took about three hours everyday to put on. But I didn&#39;t mind. I had such a great time on the movie set.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The whole story of &#39;The Wizard of Oz&#39; is brilliant,&quot; Michael told me as we sipped fresh orange juice together. &quot;The characters in it bring home a certain message. It&#39;s like a fable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The part I play, the scarecrow, represents those people who have a lot to offer, but never allow themselves to reach the top, because they just don&#39;t have any confidence in themselves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve always loved the character of the Scarecrow, even when I saw it when I was small boy in the original movie. I remember feeling so sorry for him and crying whenever he was on the screen.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The movie gave Michael a chance to team up with an old friend, the legendary and beautiful, Diana Ross.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Diana looked after us a lot when we first started. She and I became good friends. I used to stay with her whenever we&#39;d come up to New York. She got me interested in drawing and all kinds of things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One of the nicest things that happened on the movie set was when she brought her daughter and all her school class onto the movie set.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We had such a great time. Even though she spent almost the entire afternoon trying to bite off the huge false nose I had to wear for the part.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s childhood was very strict and you can be sure that when he does eventually have all those children he so much wants, he&#39;ll bring them up very properly and correctly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;My father Joseph was very strict with me and all my brothers. I&#39;m very thankful for that now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were brought up in a very rough city. Sometimes I hear terrible stories about all my old friends and all the troubles they&#39;ve been getting into.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;A lot of that is to do with the fact that they&#39;ve never had anything to do or they were brought up without any discipline.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But my father&#39;s strictness and all the rehearsing we had to do kept us out of trouble.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I remember how when I was about six, my father would take me to parties. Very often, I&#39;d fall asleep because it was so late. But he&#39;d shake me awake and get me to perform.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Sometimes it was hard and tiring, but the minute I stepped on stage and started performing, I felt so good that it was all worth it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael still lives with his parents in Los Angeles. &quot;I&#39;d think I&#39;ll stay there for some time,&quot; he admits. &quot;I&#39;m not very good around the house. I can&#39;t mend fuses or do practical things like that. Really the only thing I can do is entertain. That&#39;s why it&#39;s great having my parents look after me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A week later, when I said goodbye to Michael at the airport, I realized how much he needs someone else to take care of him. And only a girlfriend of his very own can provide that kind of love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;These Boys Got Destiny&rdquo; Article Interview:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;These Boys Got Destiny&rdquo; article (1979), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This interview was conducted at the end of the British tour in 1979, during a day that seen a hectic run of interviews done by the Jacksons. Michael had been ill during this period, but carried on regardless to support his brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Highlights included:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The brothers spent more time making sure the records and their shows were exactly how they wanted them to be. This was a far cry from their time spent at Motown when they were told what to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although they had written most of Destiny, there was one song called &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie&rsquo; they hadn&rsquo;t, which caused confusion: Marlon said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;People have thought because he&rsquo;s called Mick Jackson he must be one of us, but he&rsquo;s no relation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke about his first feature film he had recently done called &lsquo;The Wiz&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Do you know it took me three hours every day just to get made up! I even had a special wig made and I&rsquo;ve been allowed to keep it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also found filming scenes not in order to be puzzling:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Because the scenes aren&rsquo;t filmed in the correct order it can be a little confusing, but it comes out right &ndash; I think!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The experience gave Michael a thirst for watching more and more films. His favourites during this period were &lsquo;Midnight Express,&rsquo; and musicals &lsquo;Oliver&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Sound Of Music.&rsquo; Watching Oliver inspired him to record one of the songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Tony Prime Photoshoot:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Friend of photographer Tony Prime, &ldquo;News of the World&rdquo; interview (July 5, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100825210624/http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/showbiz/michael_jackson/391996/Jack-in-the-box-Michael-Jackson-in-Charlie-Chaplin-photos.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Photos include] one macabre shot of him playing dead in a coffin at London&#39;s famous Madame Tussaud&#39;s waxwork museum.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Other pictures that have never been seen before show the King Of Pop dressed as his hero Charlie Chaplin on a visit to Britain when he was 21.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One shot has Jackson in typical coy Chaplin pose with black bowler hat and cane. In another he is cowering in a corner between two brick walls.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...In Tussaud&#39;s Chamber Of Horrors he slipped into an empty wooden coffin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To his right are the waxwork models of evil sisters Margaret Higgins and Catherine Flanagan, who were responsible for killing up to 17 people to cash in their life insurance policies in the 1800s. On his left is a mannequin of Catherine Webster, who was hanged in Wandsworth jail in 1879 for murdering her boss.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The pictures were taken by British photographer Tony Prime when the Jackson 5 visited the UK in 1979.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A pal of the photographer said: &quot;Jackson was fascinated by anything weird. He absolutely loved it. When he saw the coffins he just leapt over the barrier and got in the empty one.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Prime was the only snapper with the Jacksons on a day they were doing interviews at London&#39;s Capital Radio station. It was there that a shy Jackson asked Tony if he was a Londoner because he wanted someone who could tell him where to buy the military-style jackets that were to become his trademark stage outfit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tony told him that there was a shop across the street from the radio station and took him there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The singer then insisted his new friend come with him on a tour of London and both jumped into the white Rolls-Royce the Jacksons were travelling in. Jackson told Tony he was obsessed with Charlie Chaplin and asked him to show him where the comedian was born.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The snapper&#39;s pal added: &quot;Jackson was fascinated by the life of Chaplin and wanted to know all he could about where the comic grew up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Tony told him he would take him for a drive around and point out various places related to Chaplin. Then all of a sudden Jackson said he wanted to get dressed up as Chaplin so they took him out and bought him the clothes and a cane.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, dressed as his comic hero, Jacko posed on the streets of Stockwell in south London where the silent screen legend was born in 1889.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was so thrilled with the pictures he asked Tony if he could have a set. The pal added: &quot;It was just one of those magical one-off moments.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They shared a few fun hours together and the pictures show that, but Tony never heard from him again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He has always been happy though knowing that his pictures were in Jackson&#39;s private album.&quot;</span></p></body>
