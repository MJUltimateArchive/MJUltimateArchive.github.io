		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bournemouth, England (Destiny World Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date for &ldquo;These Boys Got Destiny&rdquo; article assessed from the fact that the writer says &ldquo;they caught them at the end of their last British tour&rdquo; (could also be the 23rd or 24th)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;These Boys Got Destiny&rdquo; article (Image 001):</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie, Marlon, Tito, Randy, and Michael looked worn out. Each sat impatiently as if they&#39;d like nothing better than for someone to say they could leave their drab television dressing-room and escape to a warm, snug bed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was early evening when we met. By this time the five had been photographed many times, and had talked with endless people from newspapers and radio. And Michael wasn&#39;t feeling too well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On other days he had been off color but had insisted he couldn&#39;t let the family down. Thankfully, as we talked Michael and his brothers forgot their tiredness and soon they were laughing a great deal and letting off steam.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So what did we talk about? Well, it seemed only right to talk about how successful their records had been in Britain in the last few years. We recalled hits like &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Goin&#39; Places&quot;, &quot;Show You The Way To Go&quot;, and &quot;Destiny&quot;. Perhaps that&#39;s why they began to look more like the lively brothers we see on television and particularly on stage -- after all, who doesn&#39;t enjoy praise when it&#39;s deserved! Tito kicked off by pointing out how hard they work...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We spend ages making sure what we do on stage or record is the way we want it. These days things are better because we&#39;re writing our own songs and producing the records. Before, we often felt we did what other people thought we should be doing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Branches Out</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After several years without a British hit, the Jacksons came up with a mixture of soul and disco which proved to be a winner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But although the Jacksons are busily penning their own songs, one of their recent hits, &quot;Blame It On The Boogie&quot;, was written by someone outside the family. Marlon explained...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;People have thought because he&#39;s called Mick Jackson he must be one of us, but he&#39;s no relation.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Destiny&quot;, their latest album, was the result of the Jacksons doing things the way they liked, and Jackie reckons it has the real Jackson feel about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has of course been busy outside of singing and recording, making himself quite a name for his performance with famed lady singer Diana Ross in the film &quot;The Wiz&quot;, an updated version of the famous film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Michael told me, &quot;It was really great playing the part and I hope you like the film. Do you know it took me three hours every day just to get made up! I even had a special wig made and I&#39;ve been allowed to keep it!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He found filming a little strange, though.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Because the scenes aren&#39;t filmed in the correct order&quot;, Michael explained, &quot;it can be a little confusing, but it comes out right--I think! I really loved working on the film but I was surprised by how many things I kept learning. It was fun, though, and I really hope to do some more films.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meantime, Michael&#39;s busy </span><span class="cs43C038A">watching</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> films. His favorite is &quot;Midnight Express&quot;, and old ones like &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Oliver&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve recorded a song from &#39;Oliver&#39; called &#39;Where is Love?&#39; and I&#39;ve been making another solo album which I hope you&#39;ll like when you hear it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A Genius for a Brother</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just by looking at Michael&#39;s four brothers you can tell they think he&#39;s a real genius, and they&#39;re very proud of him. When he finished they decided to shout with some volume, &quot;We are The Jacksons&quot;, and then dissolved into laughter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then they spoke of how marvelous it was finding original fans still with them, even though they&#39;re older. Not that the brothers have forgotten the old hits and said they always ensured their stage shows contained many of those early records. Even though they think it slightly strange singing songs that were hits when they were eight years younger!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boys enjoyed their recent brief concert tour so much that they&#39;ve decided they must come back soon. The thought of another British visit really took away their former tired feeling. Once more, they leapt up chairs, and shrieked...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We are The Jacksons and we&#39;re coming back.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Which is news to cheer up anyone feeling fed-up--particularly if they&#39;re a Jackson fan!</span></p></body>
