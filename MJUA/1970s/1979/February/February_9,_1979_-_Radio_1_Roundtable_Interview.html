He&#39;d been a radio guest of mine a week before hand and he was fine on the air, talking about other people&#39;s music and he called me to one side of the room. It was quite funny he was trying to teach us how to do the moonwalk on a shagpile carpet and everyone was having fun and laughing it was great, and then suddenly, he took me to one side and he said, he called me Kid, he said &quot;Kid can you come here?&quot; He took me to one corner and said, &quot;Did you have Jermaine on your programme last week?&quot; And I said, yes I did, and he said, &quot;What did he say about me?&quot; And I said, well he didn&#39;t say anything bad, I can&#39;t remember in passing. He said &quot;He didn&#39;t say anything bad about me?&quot; I said no it was fine and he said &quot;Well that&#39;s good.&quot; And that was the end of the conversation, and I thought how weird. I felt he was insecure and very frail as an individual, I just remember that conversation because it was quite poignant and quite disturbing in the middle of a party, that he should have focused in on this, wondering what his own brother has said about him, if he had said anything nasty.</span></p></body>
