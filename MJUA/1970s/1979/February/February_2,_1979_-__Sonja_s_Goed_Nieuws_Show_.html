For the occasion, Sonja Barend&#39;s popular talk show &#39;Sonja&#39;s Good News Show&#39; will be broadcast live from De Mirandabad. Guests are Mayor Polak, artificial swimming group De Meeuwen, Peppi and Kokki. And Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lifeguard Martin Teeuw is there as a 22-year-old employee of the De Mirandabad and makes the only preserved images. &quot;I only worked there for a month and did a lot of photography as a hobby. During the shooting of the TV program I quickly took a few photos, without flash. No idea if it was actually allowed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Martin Teeuw: &quot;It was all very special, but of course work had to be done as well. Michael was already quite famous at the time and was therefore rather protected, but I still had a chat with his brother Jermaine.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The TV images from the opening have been lost forever, both the Vara and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision no longer have the recordings of Sonja&#39;s Good News Show of February 2, 1979. That makes Martin Teeuw&#39;s photos even more unique. &quot;I still have a few original slides that slowly yellow. I once lent another slide and never got it back.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons performed on the Sonja&#39;s Goed Nieuws Show on 2nd February, 1979. Presented by Sonja Barend The Jacksons performed &lsquo;Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie.&rsquo; They were at the show for the opening of the new De Mirandabad, a new wave pool.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Sonja&#39;s Goed Nieuws Show was on the Dutch channel VARA.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also meet Dutch comedy duo Kokki &amp; Peppi backstage.</span></p></body>
