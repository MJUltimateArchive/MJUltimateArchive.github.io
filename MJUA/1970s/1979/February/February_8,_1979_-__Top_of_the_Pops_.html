		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Top of the Pops&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date confirmed in &ldquo;Popscene&rdquo; (<a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160201192529/http://z6.invisionfree.com/popscene/index.php?showtopic=8918"><span class="cs149B5A36">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">) (&ldquo;8-2-79&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Superpop&quot; magazine (February 24, 1979)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When we got home from school&quot;, Michael recalled, relaxing in his dressing room between rehearsals for an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops. &quot;We would rehearse. Every day. Most kids would be outside playing, and there was a big baseball park behind our house. Some of them would shout at us, they&#39;d even start throwing things at the window. It was hard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But...&quot;, he smiled, &quot;our parents made sure we kept it going, always getting better and better.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like all the Jackson brothers, Michael&#39;s first love is music. He writes, he sings, he even helped on the studio production of &quot;Destiny&quot;. And he&#39;s very critical. &quot;Well, I think that album marks a great start.&quot; He said cautiously. Even better things to come?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before leaving for this tour, Michael was also halfway through recording his own solo album, helped by Quincy (&quot;Stuff Like That&quot;) Jones and a bunch of top-flight session musicians. Of all the brothers, he&#39;s often the most moody and reserved, perhaps due to the special pressures of being lead singer. The choice of songs for his own album seems to be a reflection of exactly that part of his character.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve always loved easy, ballad-type songs&quot;, Michael explained, &quot;songs like &#39;Ben&#39; and &#39;I&#39;ll Be There&#39;. Of course, there will be a couple of Funky numbers as well, but that&#39;s the kind of thing I want to keep doing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several of the songs he&#39;s co-written with Louis Johnson of the Brothers Johnson. In addition, there&#39;s also a specially-written tune from Stevie Wonder called &#39;I Can&#39;t Help It&#39;, while it&#39;s a custom-built Paul McCartney creation, &#39;Girlfriend&#39; that gives the forthcoming LP its title!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All in all, that sounds like quite a prize... &quot;I can&#39;t wait to finish it either!&quot;, Michael agreed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, we won&#39;t have to wait so long--probably only till April--to see Michael Jackson in his first movie role... as a Scarecrow! It&#39;s in &quot;The Wiz&quot;, an all-black, funny, funky, and futuristic remake of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; which--if you still need reminding--is the one that always turns up on TV at Christmas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;I&#39;d seen the film lots of times&quot;, explained Michael, &quot;and always fell in love with the Scarecrow. I think most do, just because you feel sorry for him. I really studied that character. So, it was amazing that I was asked to do the part. Diana has always dreamed that she would be Dorothy one day... it&#39;s more than coincidence.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It took Michael three hours, every day, at the Astoria Studios in New York, to get made up (he&#39;s kept the wig as a souvenir) and even though he was the newcomer among a case of cinema veterans, he loved every moment of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was a real challenge&quot;, he enthused, &quot;a complete new world... the things I learned! At the end of the day, they&#39;d say, &#39;Ok, curtain, time to go home. I&#39;d be so sad, I wanted to be there all night and work to death.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&#39;s one scene where the wicked Evelline has the Scarecrow sawn in half. Naturally enough it&#39;s a dummy body on the table, and Michael himself was in reality kneeling underneath with just his face showing. Plus, since he was only paper and straw, there was no harm done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Even so&quot;, he admitted, &quot;it was jolly scary to see that saw go through me, just a few inches away. And then my nephew and nieces, Tito&#39;s children, were taken to see the film, that&#39;s when they all started crying. &#39;Uncle Michael&#39;s been cut in half!&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, I can assure everyone that Uncle Michael is currently very much in one piece. In fact, he was in ecstasies over some other dummy bodies he&#39;d just been inspecting--the wax figures at Madame Tassaud&#39;s in London.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Terrific! I love costumes, statues, anything artistic or unusual. I just wish my house was full of stuff like that!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What Mrs. Jackson would say to waxworks quietly melting over the living-room carpet, I don&#39;t care to think. But I assume she&#39;s had to put up with quite a lot already, thanks to her son&#39;s very pronounced taste in exotic pets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were, for example, raccoons which did in fact eat up most of Michael&#39;s bedroom; and a llama called Lola who fortunately was more decorous and lived out in the garden. There were rats which Michael used to store in the pockets of his tuxedo jacket and whip out at untimely moments during Grammy Awards ceremonies. And there were the &nbsp;peacocks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Go into your record shop and take a look at the back sleeve of &quot;Destiny&quot; (if you don&#39;t already own a copy). You&#39;ll see at once that peacocks mean a lot to The Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;However&quot;, he concluded, &quot;about five in the morning, they&#39;d get up to the tops of the trees and start calling. Ca-aww, ca-aww, you could hear them a mile off. Eventually, unfortunately, I had to get rid of the peacocks. The neighbors were demanding some sleep!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Poor peacocks. But I guess that&#39;s Destiny.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;These Boys Got Destiny&rdquo; article (1979), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This interview was conducted at the end of the British tour in 1979, during a day that seen a hectic run of interviews done by the Jacksons. Michael had been ill during this period, but carried on regardless to support his brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The brothers spent more time making sure the records and their shows were exactly how they wanted them to be. This was a far cry from their time spent at Motown when they were told what to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although they had written most of Destiny, there was one song called &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie&rsquo; they hadn&rsquo;t, which caused confusion: Marlon said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;People have thought because he&rsquo;s called Mick Jackson he must be one of us, but he&rsquo;s no relation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke about his first feature film he had recently done called &lsquo;The Wiz&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Do you know it took me three hours every day just to get made up! I even had a special wig made and I&rsquo;ve been allowed to keep it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also found filming scenes not in order to be puzzling:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Because the scenes aren&rsquo;t filmed in the correct order it can be a little confusing, but it comes out right &ndash; I think!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The experience gave Michael a thirst for watching more and more films. His favourites during this period were &lsquo;Midnight Express,&rsquo; and musicals &lsquo;Oliver&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Sound Of Music.&rsquo; Watching Oliver inspired him to record one of the songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mick Jackson, co-writer of &ldquo;Blame it on the Boogie&rdquo;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.disco-disco.com/artists/mick.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Discoguy&rdquo; interview (Summer 2003)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Discoguy: Have you ever met the &quot;other&quot; Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mick Jackson...At Top of the Pops TV show in London, England he asked me to sell him my jumpsuit I was wearing for the show and I declined. He said, &ldquo;Name your price&rdquo;, and I still turned him down! The thing is with my big perm I KNEW I looked hot and wasn&#39;t prepared to let him in on the act. Haha! MJ was performing &#39;Destiny&#39; with his brothers that day.</span></p></body>
