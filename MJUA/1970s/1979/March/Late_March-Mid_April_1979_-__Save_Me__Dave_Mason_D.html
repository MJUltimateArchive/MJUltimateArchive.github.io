He looked at me for a minute and he said, &lsquo;I was 12 years old and I did this Diana Ross session, and the last thing she and I did together was a song called &ldquo;Feelin&rsquo; Alright,&rdquo; so yeah, absolutely, I&rsquo;ll come over and sing with you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was in one studio and he (Michael) was across the hall.
