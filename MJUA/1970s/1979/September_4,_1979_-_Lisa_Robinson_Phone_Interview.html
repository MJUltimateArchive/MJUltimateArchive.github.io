You&rsquo;ve got to remember I&rsquo;ve been around studios since I was a child, and I&rsquo;ve just picked it up. You learn, you watch . . . I&rsquo;d sit in on Stevie [Wonder]&rsquo;s sessions and just be amazed. He&rsquo;d sit there and do everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Why did you go outside the family and work with Quincy [Jones] on</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Off the Wall?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I felt there are still so many different things I want to learn that I didn&rsquo;t want to go in myself and do it. I wanted to watch a giant and learn from him. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to work with Quincy. He&rsquo;s the kind of guy who&rsquo;s unlimited musically: classical, jazz, disco, soul, pop</span><span class="cs43C038A">&mdash;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">he&rsquo;s done operas, movie soundtracks, he&rsquo;s worked with Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, all the greats, he can do everything. He can work with me and do anything I want. I wanted an album that wouldn&rsquo;t just consist of one kind of music, because I love all kinds of music. I see it all as music; I don&rsquo;t like to label it. It&rsquo;s like saying this child is white, this child is black, this child is Japanese&mdash;but they&rsquo;re all children. It reminds me of prejudice. I hate labels. I went to a record store the other day and I saw the Bee Gees in the &ldquo;Black&rdquo; category. I mean, what is that? It&rsquo;s so crazy. If somebody has a wonderful song that&rsquo;s right for me, I&rsquo;d love to do it. I wouldn&rsquo;t pass up a good song just because I didn&rsquo;t write it. On the Jacksons&rsquo; albums we write all the songs, but I love hearing other people&rsquo;s material. It&rsquo;s so much fun hearing things that I didn&rsquo;t write; I think, How did you write that? How did you do that? That&rsquo;s what I enjoy most about doing solo albums. You get to see how different people work in the studio. With the Jacksons we&rsquo;re just doing our own thing in our little private world. That&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t want the Jacksons to produce my album. I don&rsquo;t want the same sound, because mine is different.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">How was it filming</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The Wiz</span><span class="cs43C038A">?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I had the time of my life. It was an experience I&rsquo;ll never forget. I&rsquo;m just dying to do the next film. It&rsquo;s really killing me&mdash;and when I say killing me, I really mean it. Sometimes I could just scream, but I&rsquo;m so busy with other things, and what I </span><span class="cs43C038A">really</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> want to do more than anything is film. Film will last forever. I can go on tour and it&rsquo;s exciting, but when it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;ll be lost to the world. But if I do a movie, it&rsquo;ll be there forever, that&rsquo;s what I love about film: it&rsquo;s something captured, a moment captured that&rsquo;ll be there for eternity. The stars die, like Charlie Chaplin&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone, but his films will be here forever. If he did Broadway and plays while he was alive, he would have been lost to the world. I&rsquo;d have to set time aside to do films, but I always do things through force and feeling, and I always follow my instincts. If it&rsquo;s meant to be, it&rsquo;ll come, it&rsquo;ll happen. It will make itself known.</span></p></body>
