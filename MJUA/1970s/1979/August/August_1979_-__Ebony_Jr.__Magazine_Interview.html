I just wish I would read more and could find the best books to read. But the more books I read, the more I discover, that&#39;s what I love about it. I also like art and English.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">EBONY JR!: Do you do artwork in your spare time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Yes, I draw and do a little painting. If I wasn&#39;t so busy traveling, I would definitely be taking a class.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...EBONY JR!: Michael, does having a big family bother you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: No. I love it! A lot of people are lonely, &#39;cause they&#39;re an only child. I&#39;m thankful to have a big family and to be given a gift; I mean, these are gifts, to have brothers, so I&#39;m thankful, honestly. We have a good time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...EBONY JR!: What about the future? Are there any plans you&#39;d like to mention?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL &amp; TITO: We just want to continue to write, arrange and produce music. We&#39;d like to try putting together film musicals, which take quite a bit of studying. We want to do a lot more song writing, and about two or three TV specials a year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...EBONY JR!: What have been some of your favorite experiences over the past ten years?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Over the past ten years, I can pick out certain things: the performance for the Queen of England, achieving what we have done through the years through our music, bringing happiness, love and influence to a lot of people. Just doing that, I feel like a lifetime of my efforts have been rewarded. Also, producing and writing our own complete album for the first time is something we&#39;ve always wanted to do and I&#39;m thankful to have been given the chance to do it, and I&#39;m thankful so many people liked it.</span></p></body>
