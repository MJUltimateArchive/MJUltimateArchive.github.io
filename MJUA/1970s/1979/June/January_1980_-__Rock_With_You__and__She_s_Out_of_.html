At my first meeting with him, he was so shy, polite and professional. Not sure that his label CBS Records was very optimistic about his chances because the budget they gave me for these two music videos was so low, all I could afford was one laser, and a stool for him to sit on &ndash; one prop per video. So for &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Out of My Life&rdquo; I decided to let the studio go to darkness, Jerry Watson lit him beautifully in simple white backlight and the we depended on Michael to carry the moment &mdash;- which he did. For &ldquo;Rock with You&rdquo; we pulled out our big trick &ndash; the Hollywood Mach 1 laser !, Michael got his glitter on &ndash; love the boots&mdash;and a disco classic was born.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/michael-jacksons-20-greatest-videos-the-stories-behind-the-vision-20140624/17-shes-out-of-my-life-1979-0825596"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (June 24, 2014)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[On &ldquo;Rock With You&rdquo;]:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Working in a pre-MTV era, when &quot;music videos&quot; were called &quot;promos,&quot; Bruce Gowers (the video pioneer behind Queen&#39;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;) created a smoky space tunnel in an L.A. soundstage for Jackson and his sequined suit to shine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">In those days they were done for peanuts. Absolute peanuts. I think about all we could afford was the laser. This one was probably about $3,000. If you look at it, there&#39;s nothing there but a laser and Michael Jackson. When we did this, this was the start of his solo career. He was very, very timid, very quiet, very unassuming. Really nice, he&#39;s an absolute professional, even in those days.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was filmed on a little stage in L.A. called the 800 Stage, a little stage that we got cheap because we were shooting quite a lot of music videos. There was minimal editing as well, because obviously in those days editing costs money. It was about $350 per machine per hour. If you were using two playbacks and one record, that was a lot of money Everything was rented, trust me: the cameras, the stage, the Duvetyne drop, the smoke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[On &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Out of My Life]:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What you&#39;re seeing on [&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Out of My Life&rdquo;] is one complete take, it was shot multi-camera. [This and &quot;Rock With You&quot;] were both shot on the same day. I think we shot one at like three in the afternoon and one at 5&hellip; Very emotional he was in that. I was worried that he was actually going to break down and cry &ndash; which would have probably been a bit wonderful if we got some tears rolling down the face. That almost happened but not quite.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Kate Simon, photographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105126/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Lid&rdquo; magazine (2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: So, we&#39;re here to talk about that day in 1980 when you photographed Michael Jackson on the set of his music videos from his record &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: Michael Jackson was such an interesting subject and unlike anyone I have ever photographed. One thing that struck me as curious about Michael was his stillness between takes. When Michael wasn&#39;t performing, it was like he was in bubble of shyness and not able to interact with reality on the same plane as the rest of us. But when the music played, and he was singing and dancing, it was like watching a whole other being come to life, and his energy, confidence and even self awareness just stunned me as I stood there, watching with my camera.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...GM: What&#39;s interesting about the Michael Jackson shoot was that you didn&#39;t meet him until after you shot him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: I know, right? Yeah. Probably because he was shy. But boy, did he give in to me when he was dancing. It was curious how he was so autonomous and so unto himself and empowered when he was dancing. I never saw anything like him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: What were the circumstances that led to you spending the day photographing Michael in such a closed setting?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: I worked for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, a British music weekly, as their American-based photographer at the time. Susan Blonde of Epic Records International sent Stephen Demorest and I to Los Angeles so I could photograph Michael, and so he could interview him...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: Were you excited to shoot Michael, or was it just like another paid gig to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: At that time in my career, I was commonly sent out to L.A., and it was just like another gig to me. I&#39;ve got to be honest, Epic had offered to put us up in the Hilton, but I said, &quot;No way, we have to stay at The Tropicana.&quot; And to this day, Steve has a resentment about that, because a heavy metal band kept him up all night with their partying before we had to get up early in the morning to do the video shoot. To this day, he still reminds me of this, but I liked the Tropicana.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: Did you know ahead of time what the situation was going to be?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: Neither of us knew how this was going to go down. My job was basically to shoot Michael for these two video shoots. This is when the music industry was a lot of fun. We went to the sound stage, and there was nobody there. It was setup for Michael to do the videos for &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, which was just becoming a hit record for him. The videos he was shooting were &quot;Rock With You&quot; and &quot;She&#39;s Out of My Life&quot;. It was just Michael, my writer Stephen Demorest, who would interview Michael the following day, and Michael&#39;s manager who hovered behind him and watched me like a hawk. I remember that the light was really good available light. I think that the pictures have a lot of soul and are evocative. There was also a make-up girl and a couple of technicians. There were less than 10 people there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: It must have been amazing to have watched him work up close.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: My breath was just taken away. Every movement that he made was perfect. He was so enjoying it and really happy. I thought to myself that he looked fantastic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: Were you given any specific shooting instructions or told where to stand?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: Not really, I just sussed out where to stand, which was about 10 feet away from him next to the camera man. My job was clear, to make sure that I had the technical aspects in place to capture the best photographs possible, which proved to be quite a challenge with the spotlights and laser beams bouncing off of his sequined jumpsuit. The light went everywhere, but I managed to get Michael at the peak of his energy and power, and I feel that the photographs I took that day capture that energy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: Did you talk to Michael in between?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: No. It was his show. It&#39;s hard to articulate it when someone is that good. Every movement was so precise and led perfectly to the next movement. It was exhilarating to watch Michael perform with complete joy. Michael knew how he wanted to present himself to the world. It was as if the manic he possessed was being channelled into his body from the cosmos. Watching Michael dance was like watching the entire history of dance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: When did you finally speak with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: After the shoot in the soundstage, we went into a little room, and I was packing up my cameras, and I didn&#39;t want to just leave without saying goodbye. That would have felt rude. So, I said, to Michael, &quot;Well Michael, you must feel good, that went really well.&quot; I wanted to tell him that before I left. It was curious that he was socially really shy and his voice was feathery and he said to me, &quot;Well... Kate... you know...&quot;, and it sort of went away.... I did get a few good pictures of him in that room before I left which are good candid available light portraits. The room was tiny, like 12 feet by 8 feet and he was just sitting on the couch for the pictures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: What an amazing experience to have had the opportunity to photograph Michael at that time and place...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: You know, it really was an amazing experience and you can feel his joy and enthusiasm in the photographs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">GM: Definitely. Thank you for talking about that day and your incredible pictures of Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KS: It&#39;s been a real pleasure, Gillian.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Steve Demorest, &ldquo;Melody Maker&rdquo; writer, &ldquo;<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105126/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu3.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140808105126/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Lid&rdquo; magazine (2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kate finally got her access at the studio session on which Michael recorded the video of &quot;Rock With You&quot;. I&#39;m sorry to say I remember almost nothing about this, except that we were the only two outsiders there. (I was probably spending too much time watching Kate at work.) But I was later told that the resulting &quot;Melody Maker&quot; cover with Kate&#39;s photo was framed on the wall of Michael&#39;s den for years, so he must have been pleased. In the final video, you can see Michael&#39;s glittering chainmail bodysuit as he performed that day. What you can&#39;t see is Kate Simon weaving and snapping in the darkness behind the camera.</span></p></body>
