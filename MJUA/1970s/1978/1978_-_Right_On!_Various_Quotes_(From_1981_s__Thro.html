I&rsquo;m not as comfortable off stage as I am on because I was practically raised on stage. All I did was sing, dance, watch other people do it and then travel on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Some fans get really nasty. They think they own you. Sure, they bought my records and helped my career &ndash; every entertainer depends on fans &ndash; but if they didn&rsquo;t like my records, they wouldn&rsquo;t have bought them. I sold my record, not my soul. I didn&rsquo;t sell the right for them to order me around. I sold a record, and I do it for the joy to the world of it. I love people and that&rsquo;s why I do it.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
