There were three shows, at the Grand Stand, Queen&#39;s Park Savannah, Port of Spain, on February 24 and 25 then at Skinner Park, San Fernando on February 26.					</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the memorable moments of that series of shows is Michael Jackson singing &quot;Sugar Bum Bum&quot; by Lord Kitchener. So spot on was his rendition of the song people believed he had known the song before coming here.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The truth is, Frank Martineau and his brother, Claude had presented the song to Jackson when he arrived and asked if he would consider learning it then performing it on the night.		&quot;He learned the song in a couple days. The Jackson family were thrilled to visit John John, Laventille when we took them on a tour there. They also visited the Belmont Orphanage spending quality time with the children. The Jackson family always wanted to reach out to underprivileged children to inspire and encourage them since they too had come from humble beginnings,&quot; Frank Martineau said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Charge des Affairs at the US Embassy, Len Kusnitz said Jackson was his contemporary as they were of the same generation. Kusnitz said he grew up listening to Jackson&#39;s music and enjoying his early videos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://archives.newsday.co.tt/2009/06/26/trinis-michael-was-truly-the-king/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Newsday&rdquo; (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191029214411/https://archives.newsday.co.tt/2009/06/26/trinis-michael-was-truly-the-king/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Newsday&rsquo;s journalist Joan Rampersad was among the few who were fortunate to experience Jackson live in concert&hellip; &ldquo;I remember going to the concert and my pores raised to see him in action. He along with the rest of the Jackson 5 performed the then big hits &lsquo;I want you back&rsquo; and &lsquo;ABC&rsquo;. I also remembered that Jackson introduced his little brother Randy who performed Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s hit &lsquo;Sugar Bum&rsquo; which sent the crowd in sheer ecstasy. I will always cherish that memorable event.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another fan Albert Lewis said he was only 17 when he attended the Port-of-Spain concert and also described it as a &ldquo;once in a lifetime, memorable concert.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Waaz Hosein said he remembered Jackson as a &ldquo;little black boy&rdquo; with a big Afro hairstyle and will never forget the dance moves he demonstrated on stage since, including the famous Moonwalk.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I remember that the savannah was packed out. It had people all the way to where the US Embassy is located on Marli Street. Although they could not see him they heard his distinct voice and had a ball of a time,&rdquo; Hosein said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Former student of Holy Name Convent Michelle Wellington-Borde also shared her memorable experience when Jackson pulled up on the school&rsquo;s compound in a regular taxi.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I remember it was after school hours and we were practising our marching for our upcoming sports day we got word that Michael Jackson pulled up at school. I remembered that he rolled down the window to the car and began looking around.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;One of my girlfriends ran up to the car and leaned inside and asked him if he was Michael Jackson and he replied in a very soft voice &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. At that moment the girls began screaming and jumping around. We went crazy for him that day. He eventually came out of the car and walked into the school. He was wearing a red shirt and black pants and I think he had on white gloves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remembered him smiling and waving to us. Before leaving he thanked us and said that Trinidad was nice. That day will always be engraved in my heart.&rdquo; Former Holy Faith Convent student Shaharazad Sherry Khan-Dowlat also shared her memorable experience. &ldquo;I was very excited that he was here on our local soil. His performance was so thrilling and indeed he was back then a world icon and still is&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">User vlee27, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-287527"><span class="cs8567212B">CNN iReport</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met the legendary Michael Jackson back in February, 1978 when I lived in Trinidad, West Indies. &nbsp;He came there with his brothers, The Jacksons, for a concert. &nbsp;It was a chance meeting that I will never forget that lasted for almost one whole week! &nbsp;When I talk about that time, it sounds so far fetched. &nbsp;If I didn&#39;t have the pictures and autographs to prove it, I wouldn&#39;t believe it either.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the pictures I will share is of Michael and I at Las Cuevas Beach in Trinidad. (Image 001) He was such a gentle, humble, and truly special person. &nbsp;Even back then I could tell he was a perfectionist, a musical genius who loved to entertain people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A week of memories with Michael Jackson in Trinidad back in February 1978.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-288763"><span class="cs8567212B">CNN iReport 2</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">These pictures were taken at the Trinidad Hilton and at my home.

I&rsquo;d managed to get into it through my cousin Alfred Aguiton, whose PR firm AMPLE was handling the press relations for the Jacksons visit to T&amp;T.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson had already had one entire career by then, and was on the verge of launching another, steering clear of his brothers and Epic Records to chart his own path as a solo artist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Janelle &ldquo;Penny&rdquo; Commissiong, freshly crowned Miss Universe, was staying at the hotel and was invited down to meet the performers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Photo description (Image 005): When Penny met Michael.

I wrote a story about the Jacksons&rsquo; visit for Owen Baptiste&rsquo;s People Magazine, learned some hard lessons about negotiating for the value of my photographs from the Epic Records PR team and for the first time, my photographs were published internationally.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I still have the negatives from that shoot, along with all the positives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.sunheraldja.com/2009/07/jackson%E2%80%99s-journey-to-the-caribbean/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Sunday Herald&rdquo; (July 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://rhythmofthetide.com/michael-jackson-the-flirt/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181122151953/http://rhythmofthetide.com/michael-jackson-the-flirt/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I traveled down on a plane with a beautiful woman I later learned was Miss Trinidad &amp; Tobago and the Miss Universe winner,&rdquo; Manning added.
