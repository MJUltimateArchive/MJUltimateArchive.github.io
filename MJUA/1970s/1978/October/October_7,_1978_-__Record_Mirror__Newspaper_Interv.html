Things were looking up for the Jacksons with their new song, &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie.&rsquo; Michael spoke with Sexton over the telephone from the family Hayvenhurst home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Highlights:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How did they come across &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We heard, &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie&rsquo; when we were listening to a series of tapes, and this song was six years old. We recorded it as soon as we heard it and put it out as a single.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Writer Mick Jackson, no relation, had his version released by the record company no sooner the Jacksons had issued theirs, something that didn&rsquo;t go down to well with Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard the other version and its okay, but it just hasn&rsquo;t got the groove like ours has. He only put out his version when he heard ours which wasn&rsquo;t a very nice thing to do because the record company had promised us they wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On their first written and produced album, Destiny:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I wrote three of the songs with my brother Randy: &lsquo;All Night Dancin&rsquo;, Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)&rsquo; which is really long, like about eight minutes, and really in the groove, and &lsquo;That&rsquo;s What You Get (For Being Polite).&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the time of the interview Michael said he thought either &lsquo;Things I Do For You&rsquo; or &lsquo;That&rsquo;s What You Get (For Being Polite)&rsquo; would be the follow up to &lsquo;Blame It On The Boogie&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the old days in the UK:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Those were really happy days.
