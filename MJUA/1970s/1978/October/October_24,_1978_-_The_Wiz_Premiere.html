For the film&rsquo;s premiere, Michael invited me to be his date. I asked my dad, who didn&rsquo;t care one way or another if I went, but my talent agency was dead set against it. I was told, in exactly these words: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go to a premiere with a ni**er.&rsquo; Hollywood!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">VIBE magazine; June/July 1995</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I was 12, he asked me to go to the premiere of The Wiz with him, and my agent at the time said it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea, maybe because they felt he wasn&rsquo;t a big enough star yet. He never talked to me after that. I think he thought I just canceled, but it wasn&rsquo;t me at all. I was a child doing what I was told. I want you to print that, because I don&rsquo;t think he ever knew that. I lost touch with him because of it, so I don&rsquo;t really know him anymore. But I love him; he&rsquo;s one of the nicest, most innocent people I&rsquo;ve ever met. I love &ldquo;She&rsquo;s out of My Life&rdquo; because I think it describes our friendship at that time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That upset me tremendously. Had I been old enough&ndash;or had I the parental support&ndash;I could have stood my ground &amp; insisted &lsquo;Oh yes, I can.&rsquo; But my father was too disengaged to help me think it through. So, without telling Michael the reason, I turned him down. He was devastated. After that Michael didn&rsquo;t speak to me for years, until I ran into him at the Helmsley Palace in New York.</span></p></body>
