Director Sidney Lumet has also asked the 20-year-old singing star to star in Universale translation of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; playing the part Sammy Williams originated on Broadway, as a dancer who got his start as a female impersonator. Jackson is candid in explaining why he has reservations about the role. &quot;I&#39;m excited about it, but if I do it, people will link me with the part. Because of my voice, some people already think I&#39;m that way--homo, though I&#39;m actually not at all. It&#39;s just a lot of gossip, which isn&#39;t important. The only thing that is important is that I do what I want: act, sing and dance.&quot; His brothers wish him only the best with any parts that might follow his impressive debut as the scarecrow in &quot;The Wiz&quot; but they don&#39;t want Michael&#39;s new career to result in his turning his back on their five-man singing pursuits. As brother Tito explains, &quot;The rumors of Michael&#39;s leaving us have been around for a long time. But the truth is, we&#39;ll always be together. We work best as a group.&quot; That group including Michael will make an international tour next month to promote their new Destiny LP, the first recording which they totally wrote and produced on their own. Upon their return, youngest brother Randy will record a solo LP and another album will be recorded by the entire group.</span></p></body>
