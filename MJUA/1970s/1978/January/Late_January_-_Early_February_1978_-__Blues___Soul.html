		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range confirmed by the fact that Marlon mentions that &ldquo;we are doing a European and African tour right now&rdquo;, and the European tour started January 22, 1978; since the article was published on February 13, 1978, the interview would have had to fall within this range.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot; Magazine Interview:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Blues &amp; Soul (February 13-26, 1978) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115137/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/bluessoul3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;At the time [in 1965] they used to sing mostly Motown songs&quot;, recalls Joe. &quot;You know, things like &#39;My Girl&#39;, &#39;Get Ready&#39;--and two songs that Sam &amp; Dave had done, &#39;You Don&#39;t Know Like I Know&#39; and &#39;Hold On, I&#39;m Comin&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Then we did &#39;Tobacco Road&#39;. And all of the other hits of the day. Michael was the lead singer; Jermaine was back-up lead.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Since Motown registered and, therefore, owned the name &quot;The Jackson 5&quot;, they became simply &quot;The Jacksons&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maybe one day we&#39;ll be able to find a way of getting the name back&quot;, Joe wistfully says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the signing with CBS/Columbia, Joe says: &quot;We were offered more money, our own publishing company, and control of our recording--all of the things that we most wanted. Since moving to CBS, the guys have become established as writers and producers and all of the things have happened as CBS said. In short, we got what we wanted and our main aim now is to perfect it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first CBS album--simply titled &quot;The Jacksons&quot;--was produced by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. &quot;I had tried to get them to produce us at Motown when I felt we needed a new direction, but it wasn&#39;t done&quot;, Joe recalls. &quot;So, when we got to CBS, of course, it was that much easier because of their ties with the company. To me, Gamble and Huff are the best producers in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although the success ratio with CBS comes nowhere near the heady early days at Motown, the Jacksons all feel they are better established today than they have ever been. They have become songwriters and there is talk now that they may take on outside productions. To date, only lack of time has prevented this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They have taken on co-management from Weisner-DeMann, although Joe still pulls most of the strings. This has permitted a fuller background organization. Regency Artists has taken over agency for booking the concert dates around the world. And Rodgers &amp; Crown have taken over Press liaison.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In short, the workload has been divided between several established and well-organized corporation. This can do nothing but good for the Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They all cite &quot;Destiny&quot; as the main change in their direction, because it is their first self-produced, self-penned album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the nicest things about the whole family is that they genuinely appreciate their fans. Perhaps that is why nearly 100,000,000 records have been sold around the world in their first ten years. Perhaps that is why they are on of the few American groups who are truly international, because they are just as popular in Africa, in Europe, in Australia, and in Japan--as they are at home in America.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Suffice to say that I am sure that in ten years time, B&amp;S will still be writing about The Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What sticks in your mind mostly from the ten years, Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Doing great things! I totally enjoy what I&#39;m doing and bringing joy into people&#39;s lives. To me, all joy is young and if I can bring one second of joy into a child or a grown-up&#39;s life, then I have achieved my lifetime ambition. That&#39;s why we have been traveling all over the world entertaining people for these ten years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We have played for kings and queens all over the world--things I never dreamed of when I was small. People said: &quot;You kids are gonna go far.&quot; But I never dreamed this far! So, I&#39;m thankful. It&#39;s such a wonderful feeling to make hungry, crying children smile.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you find you get more satisfaction from your achievements as you go along?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, much more. It&#39;s definitely what keeps us going at times--although I do feel more comfortable on stage than anywhere else.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is the success you had personally with &quot;The Wiz&quot; going to lead you into more such things?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, other films. There&#39;s a Bill Robinson movie called &quot;The Bojangles Story&quot;. And another movie called &quot;Summer Stock&quot; that is about young boys trying to get into the theatre. Then there is &quot;Chorus Line&quot;, which is a play being turned into a movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is this going to alter your status in the group? Will you always be in the group?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I hope so. My brothers are good writers and they have so much talent and ability and together there are so many things that we still want to achieve.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How about your solo career? You have just released your first solo single since leaving Motown (&quot;You Can&#39;t Win&quot; from &quot;The Wiz&quot; soundtrack). Is it the first of many?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The only reason why I didn&#39;t do it before is because we wanted to take care of the group completely first. Now I am working with Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones, and Paul McCartney on an album. Paul has written a song for me called &quot;Girlfriend&quot; that I have already recorded. ANd Stevie has written a terrific song for me that I have done a rough on, too--with Louis Johnson playing bass. There will be an album this summer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Oh, and there is a beautiful song on it called &quot;She&#39;s Out of My Life&quot; that was written by Tom Bahler. It&#39;s so pretty that I think it could be another &quot;Ben&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Would you say you have outgrown your teenybopper/&quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot; days?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No--it&#39;s fine by me, because we like to give the people exactly what they want. There&#39;s no use creating music that people don&#39;t want. The object is to bring joy into other people&#39;s lives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you want to achieve in the next ten years?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There&#39;s so much... but I do want to choreograph certain films that I do. I also want to do some &nbsp;directing. The main aim, though, is to keep people happy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Do you have a message for your fans?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There&#39;s a line that I do at the end of &quot;The Wiz&quot; that I feel is especially effective. It goes like this: &quot;Success, fame, and fortune--they are all illusions. All there is that is real is the friendship that two people can share.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think that sums it up, because the real bottom line is love and friendship. The rest just comes afterwards. I like to think everybody I entertain as being a friend. But I do particularly love children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Over the next ten years, how many children do you expect to have of your own then!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> About twenty! I want to adopt kids, too. I&#39;m crazy about them. It is the innocence they have--they are the way I wish the world really was, because they are not phony and they don&#39;t know prejudice. Prejudice is taught. If the world were full of only children, it would be a much better place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S [to Tito]:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What are your plans for the next ten years?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Tito: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">We are starting to produce records now and to write more songs. And we want to go into movie scores and into producing other acts. There is nothing definite that I can talk about, but plans are well advanced on both things. We have our own production company called Peacock Productions and it will all go through that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">B&amp;S:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I presume you are going to be producing your own next album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Tito:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, it&#39;s something we always wanted to do. But we have been lucky enough to work with a lot of brilliant producers and to be able to learn from them&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&quot;The Bojangles Story&quot; Film:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;A producer came up with an idea for a movie that I really want to do. It&rsquo;s about a tap dancer trying to get started in show business. The film explores the troubles he faces as an entertainer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s a very dramatic story. That&rsquo;s the kind of movie that would fit me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, unknown interview with more on &ldquo;Summer Stock&rdquo;, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The one I&rsquo;m really excited about is &lsquo;Summer Stock&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s about these two young boys who want to get into the theatre. The movie is about their struggle for success and the hard times they have to go through. But one thing I really want to get into is serious, straight acting &ndash; though I obviously want to do another musical eventually.</span></p></body>
