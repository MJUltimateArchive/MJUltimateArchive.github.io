It appears this may have been produced to send to radio stations when they were touring in a particular area, to give the impression they were being interviewed. Some elements can be found in the Michael Jackson Rocks Thriller interview in 1984.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael remembered how young they were when doing the Ed Sullivan show:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, Jackie and Marlon did all the choreography but not all of it rehearsed went to plan sometimes and they admitted a lot of spontaneous natural body moments were incorporated.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When there were disagreements between him and his brothers Michael jokingly said what happened:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We slap heads.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said that their biggest Motown hit &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There&rsquo; was originally written about a train. He sang a few bars from this version.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael notes that he loved the song &lsquo;Maybe Tomorrow,&rsquo; which he said was one of his favourites. His memory seemed cloudy when he said he wished it had been a single, when it had in fact been a hit at no. 20 on the American Billboard Singles chart and no. 3 on the R&amp;B chart.</span></p></body>
