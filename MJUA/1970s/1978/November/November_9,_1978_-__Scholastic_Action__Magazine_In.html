When Michael Jackson was in the second grade, a teacher asked him that question. Here is what he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;One, peace in the world. Two, a mansion. And three, to be able to entertain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is now 13 years later. Michael is 20 years old. We may still be having some problems with peace in the world. But what about Michael&rsquo;s other two wishes? They certainly have come true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has been a star for half his life. At 10, he started singing with The Jackson Five. Today, the brothers are just called The Jacksons. Michael has always been their lead singer. And he has always been great at it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But now there is something new for Michael. Have you seen his new movie? It&rsquo;s called &#39;The Wiz.&#39; If you have , you know he can really act. And you should see him &ldquo;ease on down the road.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s a regular dancing machine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But there is one thing you might not know about Michael Jackson. He&rsquo;s also a really nice guy. Recently, we talked to him at his home in Los Angeles. Here are just some of the things he had to say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Can you tell us something about your part in &#39;The Wiz?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> First, I loved doing it, I love acting. And this part was a dream come true. I play the Scarecrow. He&rsquo;s looking for something he thinks he doesn&rsquo;t have &ndash; brains. But he has all the brains in the world. His problem is that he doesn&rsquo;t believe in himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you do anything special to help you get ready for the part?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I studied the book &#39;The Wizard of Oz.&#39; It&rsquo;s not just a kiddie story, you know. It has deep, deep wisdom. You see, there are a lot of people today just like the Scarecrow, They think they can&rsquo;t do what they want to do. They think they don&rsquo;t have the ability. But really, they just don&rsquo;t believe in themselves. That&rsquo;s the real magic of life &ndash; believing in yourself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are you at all like the Scarecrow?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I hate to say it. But I really am shy. I know what I can do, though. And I try to learn all the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> If you were not in show business, what would you like to be doing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I would be into art. If there is a word that means more than love, that&rsquo;s how I feel about art. Sometimes I see a beautiful painting. And it really makes my cry. Really.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you have a girlfriend?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I have girlfriends. But they&rsquo;re friends. The right girl has to come along. I&rsquo;ll take my time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What would you say to a young person who wants to go into show business?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Just never give up. Work hard. Because the harder you work, the more your wishes are going to come true. Mine did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">ACTION:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And lots of fans are glad they did!</span></p></body>
