Michael talked about a variety of subjects from his early introduction to music from his parents, performing for the Queen and making The Wiz.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His favorite songs at that particular time were The Emotions, &lsquo;Best Of My Love&rsquo; and &lsquo;Got To Give It Up&rsquo; by Marvin Gaye.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Did he find producing with his brothers difficult?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No, not at all, because when we are producing our songs we become more free and more happy. You see, all our lives we&rsquo;ve always wanted to do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Did Michael and his brothers do many takes of the songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No, no, not often, in fact very, very seldom. If you do it over and over sometimes you lose the feeling and spirit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said that he didn&rsquo;t have a girlfriend but had two special girls in his life, Clare and Anne. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What was his favorite Jackson single?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;My one favorite would be Ben. That song is demanded all over the world wherever we go. Everywhere they must hear Ben.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking about the writers of the song, Michael said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;With Monty Sharp, who wrote Ben; we&rsquo;re doing some things together now. He&rsquo;s a great writer, Monty Sharp, and Don Black.&rdquo; *Please note Michael may have got mixed up in the interview here where he mentions Monty Sharp. I think he may have meant Walter Scharf.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s favorite TV show at the time was &lsquo;Wild Kingdom.&rsquo;</span></p></body>
