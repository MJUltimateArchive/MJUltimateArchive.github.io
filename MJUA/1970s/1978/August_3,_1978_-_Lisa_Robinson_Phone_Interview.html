When I&rsquo;m in New York, I get up early and I&rsquo;m ready to start the day. You have a whole schedule: I&rsquo;m going to see this play at this time, and I&rsquo;m going to have lunch, I&rsquo;m going to see a movie&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I like about it, so much . . . energy. Whenever I come back home, I look forward to going back to New York. I love the big stores&mdash;I love everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">You&rsquo;ve been seen out with Janelle Penny Commissiong, the former Miss Universe. Is it a romance?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [Laughter, giggling.] That&rsquo;s a hard question to answer. Like most of the people you may see me out with, like Tatum [O&rsquo;Neal] and Janelle, they&rsquo;re kind of on and off, they&rsquo;re friends, and [hysterical laughter] . . . I talk to them. I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it, really [more laughter]. I don&rsquo;t know what to say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">O.K., change the subject. What was it like to work with Diana on</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The Wiz</span><span class="cs43C038A">?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was incredible, wonderful. I learned so much from her. We&rsquo;re like brother and sister, really. She was such a help&mdash;she made sure I was O.K. on the set; every morning she&rsquo;d come to my room and ask if I needed anything. She was very protective. I just loved the world of moviemaking; I love it more than reality. Sometimes I just wish I could wake up in the morning to a big production dance number.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">As for reality, do you still like meeting your fans?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I enjoy all that sometimes, seeing people who love me, or buy my records. I think it&rsquo;s fun, and I enjoy meeting my fans and I think it&rsquo;s important. But sometimes people think you owe your life to them; they have a bad attitude&mdash;like &ldquo;I made you who you are.&rdquo; That may be true&mdash;but not that </span><span class="cs43C038A">one person.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Sometimes you have to say to them, If the music wasn&rsquo;t good, you wouldn&rsquo;t have bought it. Because some of them think they actually </span><span class="cs43C038A">own</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> you. Someone will say, &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sign this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can I have your autograph?&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Yes, do you have a pen?&rdquo; And they say, &ldquo;No, go get one.&rdquo; Honestly. I&rsquo;m not exaggerating. But I just try to deal with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Are you having fun with your new car [a recently purchased blue Silver Shadow Rolls-Royce]?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, it&rsquo;s my favorite car. I know how to drive it, but I hate to take pictures in it. You know, you see so many people with their new cars, and it&rsquo;s a little show-offy. I&rsquo;m really not like that.</span></p></body>
