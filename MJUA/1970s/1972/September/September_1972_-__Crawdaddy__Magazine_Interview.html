			music room in the summer of 1972 about his success with his brothers and future plans.</span></p>

	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Did he consider himself a star:</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yeah, sometimes when we go to the movies or go cart or
			horseback we have to have security cause like, everybody pile up and follow us around.&rdquo;</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is the publicity story of how Diana Ross discovered them at a
			talent show in Indiana.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Did they spend much time in the studio?</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s time to go on the road we come in here every
			day six to nine or three to six and rehearse. When we know it&rsquo;s time to go on the road we know, like,
			we have the whole show down but we do more improvements as we go along. Like we might find something funny
			or add new things or find a talk spot, you know, so we come in and do it.&rdquo;</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rockin&rsquo; Robin was first sung by Michael in the office to see
			how it sounded. When signs were good upon hearing it, Michael went to the studio to record it.</span></p>

	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s voice changes, but when your voice changes
			it has nothing to do with singing a different way or can&rsquo;t sing no more. If it just changes then you
			sing the same way.&rdquo;</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides music Michael what else would Michael like to do?</span></p>

			done Michael replied:</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of people starving and dying &lsquo;cause
			there&rsquo;s no food. Now if they wouldn&rsquo;t go to the moon so much just to see some rocks we can use
			it for something else.&rdquo;</span></p>
