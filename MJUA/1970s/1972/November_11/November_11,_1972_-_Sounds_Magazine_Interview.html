Michael is described as a phenomenon by Valentine, a talent that comes around once in a lifetime and drew on the similar excitement aroused by Stevie Wonder when first signed for Motown. But he gives the credit to his father for believing in their talent and pushing them to rehearse regularly to perfect their act.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He started us off and kept us going. We&rsquo;d come home from school and he&rsquo;d make us rehearse. One time I reckoned we&rsquo;d be rehearsing and winning talent contests until we were grown men. For a while we&rsquo;d get real tired. He&rsquo;d keep saying &lsquo;keep working on it baby. PractiCe makes perfect - one day you&rsquo;ll get to Hollywood!&rsquo; Well, I mean, I never believed that, but as it turned out, he was right.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
