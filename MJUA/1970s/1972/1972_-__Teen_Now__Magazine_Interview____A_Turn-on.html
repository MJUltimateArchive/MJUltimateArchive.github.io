There&#39;s a large heated swimming pool, equipped with diving boards and water chute, a basketball half-court, where all the boys play together at least once a day, a badminton court, and an archery range--one thing&#39;s for sure, the boys will never have to worry about keepin&#39; fit!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Alongside the pool the J5 have built themselves a playroom which is fitted out with pool tables and pinball machines--another favorite J5 hobby!

He also loves playing the drums--says it helps get rid of his nervous energy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;A Turn-on Evening with The Jackson 5&rdquo; article</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Another evening activity dear to the hearts of The Jackson Five takes place in the kitchen.
