Dee is a fantastic cook and when she makes something special she invites all of us over!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: She says marrying Tito got her a whole bunch of new brothers. Dee&#39;s a really groovy chick! We&#39;re all nutty about her!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TiGER BEAT: Do any of you ever have any regrets about being in show business?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON: It&#39;s been my life ever since I can remember, and I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything else!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: The traveling when we&#39;re touring gets me down sometimes—y&#39;know, rushing for the bus at the piano and barely making it when we are running behind schedule. There are days I think that this time we just aren&#39;t going to get there on time, but we always do! And then, once we&#39;re in front of an audience, I forgot about all the hassles and worries!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: The only thing that bugs me is when I have to get up an extra hour early to catch a plane! I really love my sleep in the morning!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TITO: It may sound hard to believe, but we really dig being together, and I think we&lsquo;re very lucky to be working as a group. If we didn&#39;t like each other it would be awful, but as it is, even rehearsing is fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TiGER BEAT: There must be times when you have disagreements. How do you handle them when they come up?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE: Oh, we just gang up on whoever doesn&#39;t go along with the rest of us and persuade him to change his mind! Well, seriously, we do have our differences sometimes. Instead of getting all uptight, we try to talk things out and figure who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON: Mostly we get along on all the big things like the music and the dance routines. It&#39;s little stuff like who is going out to get pizza that we argue about!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: And when we aren&#39;t getting anywhere, we usually settle it by a vote.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Yeah, and I get to go &#39;coz I&#39;m the youngest around here!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TiGER BEAT: What area of show business do you enjoy the most—working on TV, doing live concerts, or recording?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE: I dig all of it. But if I had to make a choice, I&#39;d say doing the TV shows. I&#39;m a real TV fan anyway, and when I get a chance to work with a guy I admire like Flip Wilson, it&lsquo;s groovy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TITO: I think I like recording best. That&#39;s probably because I like our music to be just right—with the sound and beat where it should be. Only when we record can we take the time to have everything just perfect. Even when we have to do a number over 10 times the results are worth it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: That&#39;s cool, but nothing replaces performing in front of a live audience! It&#39;s really a thrill to look out at a huge crowd and think they all came to be entertained by us! That&#39;s the best feeling as far as I&#39;m concerned!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON: I agree, don&#39;t you Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Yes! I&#39;m just as nutty over our dance routines as the singing, and when there&#39;s an audience I try even harder to be good! But even when we&#39;re recording, I&#39;m still dancing even though nobody can see me!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TiGER BEAT: Speaking of your audiences, are there any fans that you&#39;ve met that you especially remember?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: I remember a girl who was standing outside the recording studio one day, holding a camera. She was looking at us when we came in and I waved at her, but she didn&#39;t come closer, so I guessed she was waiting for somebody else. We were in there almost 8 hours, and when we left, she was still there! So I went up to her. She wanted to take a picture of us but she had been afraid to ask!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TITO: We felt so bad that she&#39;d been out there all day that we took her on a tour of the studio and then out for a hamburger afterwards!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE: The fans we meet at our concerts are terrific! There was this one girl who kept writing me that she&#39;d be at our show in New York wearing a cowboy hat! I got letter after letter, and it stuck in my mind. I looked for her and there she was! I waved at her and pointed to her hat and we laughed and laughed!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON: There are lots of fans right out here who know where we live and come over all the time. We know them real well now—like what grade they&#39;re in in school and all that. There&#39;s one bunch of girls who are always bringing us homemade cookies and stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Oh, and just last week two girls brought us all t-shirts they&#39;d tie-dyed themselves. We were really zonked out that they went to all that trouble!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE: There&#39;s only one problem with having fans, and that&#39;s that we can never find enough time to talk to all of them! When we&#39;re out of town staying at a hotel some of them always find out where we are staying. We all try to get down and at least say hello.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TITO: But then we have to run all and rehearse and there are some girls we weren&#39;t able to talk to. They looked so disappointed it makes all of us feel bad.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: I think they understand, though. Gee, I hope so!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TiGER BEAT: One last question. Think it over real carefully and then tell us the one word which is the most important in the world to you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON: Music!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TITO: Peace!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: Family!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE: Loyalty!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Love!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TIGER BEAT: Well put! Thanks a lot, all of you!</span></p></body>
