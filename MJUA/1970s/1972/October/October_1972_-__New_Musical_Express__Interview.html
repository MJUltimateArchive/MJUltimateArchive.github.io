		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;New Musical Express&quot; Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that Jermaine mentions their upcoming trip and Royal Variety Performance, which takes place on October 30, 1972; the recent &ldquo;Corner of the Sky&rdquo; single release (October 1972 release) is also mentioned by Jackie. / Publish date of October 28, 1972 confirmed on <a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808114850/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/j5_articles.html"><span class="cs149B5A36">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s website</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115013/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/nme5.html"><span class="cs8567212B">New Musical Express (October 28, 1972)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It seemed easy enough: &quot;Phone this number in America at 9:30 pm our time and ask for Michael Jackson in Rehearsal Hall 5.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the dot of 9:30 I got through. &quot;You want Michael?&quot;, asked a suspicious female voice. &ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I answered this interrogation loud and clear and after about 15 seconds the chirpy voice of Michael Jackson came on the phone demanding to know exactly what I&#39;d told the suspicious voice. I tried to emphasize that previous arrangements had been made by Motown in Britain to interview him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson M. would have none of it. &quot;I don&#39;t know about that. Phone back in an hour. Ask For Reggie Wiggins, our road manager. I can&#39;t talk to you.&quot; I hung up thinking this treatment a bit strong from a 14 year old.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hanging round for a further hour at 10:30, I put down my knitting and got through to Mr. Wiggins, who was duly apologetic for the inconvenience, explaining that Michael had to wait until he arrived before he could say anything. It put me in mind of suspects being questioned by the police refusing to say a word until their lawyer arrived.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nevertheless, I still wasn&rsquo;t able to speak with Michael. Instead, I got two of his older brothers, Jermaine and Jackie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking first to Jermaine, we got talking about their upcoming visit to Britain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;re really looking forward to it&quot;, he said. &quot;We&#39;ve never been to England before and are all very excited about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;But the most important thing we&#39;ll be doing there will be the Royal Variety Show and we&#39;re very honored at having the opportunity of performing before the Queen. Far as I can remember we&#39;ve never played for anyone so important before.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Our youngest brother Randy who is only 10 will be coming over with us. But it won&#39;t be his first time on stage. He toured with us in the summer so he&#39;s quite a professional now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;As for our schooling we&#39;re having to bring a tutor along with us on this tour, and all of us except Jackie will have to spend three hours a day studying which is a drag. But we&rsquo;re not going to miss out on sightseeing because of that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Suddenly there&#39;s a lot of movement over the telephone wires, a voice breaks in and says, &quot;Here&#39;s Jackie&quot;, taking me completely by surprise because I&#39;d been in mid-conversation with Jermaine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyway, we spoke about the solo careers of himself, Jermaine and Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Well I&#39;m doing solo recordings now and I&#39;ve an album called &quot;Jackie&quot; which will be released in the States shortly. Jermaine has one out already.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;As for Michael he&#39;s had a great success with the album and single called &quot;Ben&quot; just lately which is the soundtrack for the movie. The single was No. 1 in the American charts last week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Our last single and album in the States (both called &#39;Looking Through The Windows&#39;) are still selling well. The single has just been released in England.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And we we&#39;ve a new American single called &#39;Corner Of The Sky&#39;, which was taken from the Broadway musical Pippin&#39;, and that is just taking off now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;By the way we&#39;re still calling ourselves the Jackson Five even though Randy&#39;s joined us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then as suddenly as Jackie had taken over from Jermaine. I was told they had to go off to rehearsals and goodbye and hope to see you when we&#39;re over. Uhmm...</span></p></body>
