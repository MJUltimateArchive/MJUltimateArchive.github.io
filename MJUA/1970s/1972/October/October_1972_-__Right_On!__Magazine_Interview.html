I can walk to the store here near my house, but anytime I go somewhere else I have to have some kind of security. It&#39;s nice just to be able to go out and get lost in a crowd. However...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...it&#39;s also true that I kinda like the idea of girls trying to get to me! I think about girls, but I don&#39;t go out with them yet because I&#39;m too young. My brothers do though. Sometimes girls will find out where I live and come to see me at the gate in front of our house. They want photographs and autographs and stuff like that. I give them what they want and they leave. I have to. After all, *they* buy my records! But it makes me feel good to know they like me enough to wait outside like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love the whole thing my brothers and I have been going through. I like traveling, staying at hotels, meeting different people, flying. To me work is fun!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love to meet people who are interesting. It&#39;s kind of a drag to always meet people who spend our whole time together talking about me! When I meet someone, well someone like &quot;Right On!&quot;&#39;s photographer Kenny Lieu, who&#39;s from a different country like China. I really have a lot of questions to ask him! Why should we talk about me? He&#39;s probably more interesting. Everyone knows about my life!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diana Ross makes me happy! She&#39;s still very involved in our career and visits us whenever she can. She&#39;s like a sister to us!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I dig messing around with my brothers. We have all the normal hassels and stuff, but we also have a good time... lots of times!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I really feel good after I&#39;ve cut a good record--either by myself or with my brothers. It&#39;s just groovy to listen to the playback of something you&#39;ve worked so hard or in the studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I also love it when the record I&#39;ve cut turns out to be a big hit! Don&#39;t think I take it casually! The biggest moment of my life was when &quot;I Want You Back&quot; went to number one!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love sports, team sports. When my brothers and friends and I play basketball or something--it really turns me on! I feel great!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love drawing. I spend most of my weekly allowance for art supplies... and sometimes bubble gum too. Drawing is really fun. Lots of people don&#39;t think they can draw--and they can! Maybe they don&#39;t draw exactly like someone else draws, but so what? What&#39;s a good drawing? Sure, you have to practice, just like with music. But I understand how important practicing is now. My father used to make us practice our music every day after school back in Gary, Indiana. Maybe we didn&#39;t like it back then, but we understand it now. Watching yourself get better at something is a turn on--no matter what you&#39;re doing.</span></p></body>
