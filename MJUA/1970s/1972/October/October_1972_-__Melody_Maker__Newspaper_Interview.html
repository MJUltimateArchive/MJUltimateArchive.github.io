For accompanying the Jacksons and Osmonds is the biggest move of fan worship since Beatle-mania.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First to arrive are the Jackson 5. Their plane, Pan Am Flight &nbsp;Number 706 is scheduled to arrive at Terminal 3 at 7:20 a.m. The Osmonds arrive on TWA Flight Number 790 which is [unintelligible] to arrive at Terminal 3 at 10:30 a.m. Special arrangements have been made for the Osmonds to drive in front of Terminal 2.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Together with David Cassidy, the Jacksons and the Osmonds make up a trio of American acts that have brought back fan hysteria on a massive level. Record sales for the Osmonds alone are topping records met by the Beatles at the height of their touring days.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Britain alone, the Jackson 5 have sold two million singles and 100,000 albums for Tamla Motown in tow years, counting recordings by the group and lead singer Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First-to-arrive Jacksons will spend the Sunday at rehearsals for the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium which takes place the following day. Following concerts on the Continent the group plays two shows at Birmingham Odeon &nbsp;on November 9, Belle Vue Manchester (10), Liverpool Empire--two shows--(11) and winds up with a massive concert at the Wembley Empute Pool on November 12...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the eve of the British tour, The Jackson Five talk to MM in New York</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Obviously I had the market on teen magazine heart throbs cornered. I was sitting in my Las Vegas hotel room in front of fuzzy textured wallpaper picturing a romantic vision of the Roman ruins and I was chatting with the Jackson 5 on the telephone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I finished with them it was into an elevator next to a statue of Julius Ceasar to zip upstairs to talk to the Osmonds. If David Cassidy had knocked on my door the teen triumvirate would have been complete.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson 5 had just spent a beetle week in Motown&#39;s Los Angeles recording studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Songs</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were recording a lot of songs&quot;, 21-year-old Jackie told me over the phone from the Jacksons&#39; Encino, California home. &quot;They could end up being on an album. What we do is cut a lot of songs and the producers and staff at Motown pick the best ones.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Aside from having a swimming pool and basketball court, the home boasts a 18 track studio. &quot;We use it to make [illegible]&quot;, explained the 14-year-old. &quot;Ain&#39;t No Sunshine&quot; brother, Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The biggest thing in the Jackson&#39;s life now is the upcoming English tour. &quot;I&#39;m kind of excited and I want to sightsee some&quot;, Michael told me. &quot;Which place is Napoleon in?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;France&quot;, I answered. Michael must have been daydreaming when the tutor, who gives the boys lessons three hours a day on the road, discussed Napoleon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh, right&quot;, he said. &quot;I would like to go there too. In London, I&#39;d like to go to the stores and get some clothes, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackets</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I hope we have a day or two off to do some sight-seeing&quot;, Jackie said. &quot;I&#39;d like to buy some jackets there.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I asked Jermaine, 17, what was the most exciting thing that happened to him so far, he answered, &quot;It hasn&#39;t happened yet, but it&#39;s going to England. We&#39;ve never been before and we got a lot of fan mail and have a lot of friends there.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The fan mail is important to Jermaine who says he tried to read it to [see] how people feel about the group. Despite their huge success, Jermaine is able to get to know kids his own age in school.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I go to public school in Encino&quot;, he said. &quot;The kids treat me nice. A few ask for autographs but most of them don&#39;t know who I am.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It sounds incredible that anyone would not recognize a Jackson Fiver. It&#39;s only a few short years since Mayor Richard Gordon Hatcher of Gary, Indiana, their hometown, asked Diana Ross to listen to a group of local youngsters who had appeared in a talent show. Miss Ross told Motown boss Berry Gordy about the boys and soon they were signed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not only have they been stacking up the gold records ever since but they also became the fastest selling recording group in Motown history. The boys are now an integral part of the Motown family. Michael said that the week before, they had hosted a big party at the house for all of the Motown gang.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although it&#39;s not easy growing up in the limelight, Michael said that he doesn&#39;t ever miss doing the things normal kids do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I like what I&#39;m doing&quot;, he said. &quot;I do have a lot of friends outside show business too and they [illegible] as regular.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When we first started&quot;, [illegible] Jackie, &quot;I missed the social things a little. But I&#39;m used to it now and I don&#39;t mind it. It&#39;s my job. My work is entertaining people. I get a chance to go out with friends on weekends when we&#39;re not on the road, I love the work--it&#39;s hard work, but I love it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&#39;s no denying that the Jacksons can inspire their fans. Jackie feels they&#39;ve influenced their fans with &quot;our style of music and the way we entertain on stage. We try to give them a good show. I think our togetherness is a good influence too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Happiness in excess is what the boys provide their fans. When they played Madison Square Garden they had to stop the show and leave the stage four or five times until ushers herded the kids out of the aisles and into their seats. That happened often at J5 concerts and Jackie confessed: &quot;It&#39;s not too good because sometimes you lose the groove when you have to stop the performance for a few minutes.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">None of the boys worry about being trampled by the fans because as Jackie said: &quot;We have very good security. Whenever we see the crowd getting over anxious, we make a quick getaway. We have it worked out to get off the stage and into the cars in six seconds. It&#39;s the quickest getaway in show business.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Frightened?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We don&#39;t get frightened of the crowds&quot;, commented Tito. &quot;We know our security even have good brains, and they know when to say walk and when to say run. I think that sometimes the guards are too rough with the kids and I would like to do a concert sometimes without all that security. But it&#39;s impossible. The fire marshals usually make the rules about the aisles being kept clear.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine told me: &quot;I don&#39;t feel like a prisoner because we can [illegible] go out with security people. That&#39;s their job whether we like it or not.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Occasionally they do go out shopping or visit radio stations. But, said Michael, &quot;Girls chase me. That&#39;s why we need our security who come on stage with us too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Movies will probably be the Jacksons&#39; next big step. &quot;We&#39;ve had a lot of offers&quot;, said Michael. &quot;I want to act in either comedy or serious things.&quot; Marlon&#39;s aim is acting in a cowboy film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boys&#39; father, who was a crane operator back home in Indiana and played guitar as a hobby, inspired them to become musicians. Onstage Tito plays guitar and Jermaine plays bass while Randy joins in on the congas as well as sings and dances. &quot;Nobody ever took lessons&quot;, Jackie pointed out. &quot;Music was just a family thing and we used to come home from school and rehearse. There was nothing else to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jermaine and Michael have been writing some songs together. &quot;I wrote several songs for a special person&quot;, adds Jermaine. &quot;One is a [sad] song that I&#39;m doing for Glen Campbell to record. It&#39;s not finished yet and I&#39;m fixing [it] up now. Eventually I&#39;d like to make an album containing all my own original songs.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">New Stuff</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon, who can&#39;t wait until he gets to England, said the group will be doing some new material for their shows there. &quot;I don&#39;t know what it is yet&quot;, he told me. &quot;They haven&#39;t told us yet, but we&#39;ll be rehearsing some new stuff.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &quot;they&quot; who haven&#39;t told them refers to Motown&#39;s staff of writers, choreographers, costumers, conductors, and producers who keep a close watch on every aspect of each group. It&#39;s been that way from the beginning at Motown, where very little is left to chance. Even interviews are closely watched with definite time limits laid out and even [illegible] often feels answers controlled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The only spontaneous happening during my phone interview occurred when Michael was about to hand over the phone to Jermaine. I complained that I was having trouble hearing because the phone connection was so poor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Don&#39;t get tired&quot;, Michael exclaimed in a loud voice, &quot;You&#39;ve got four more to go.&quot; I could almost see him smile at the other end of the wire.</span></p></body>
