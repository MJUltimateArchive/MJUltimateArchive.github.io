Soul had been with the Jackson 5 right from the beginning when Diana Ross introduced them at the Daisy in Beverley Hills in August, 1969. From that point on Soul magazine followed their progress and conducted many interviews and articles on the group.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This particular issue was no different as Soul travelled to the Motown offices home to interview them once again. What had endeared the Jacksons to soul was their courteous manner and willingness to speak. Spiegelman asked what the ultimate success was. Michael replied:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like acting. I like it just as much as singing. Serious acting &ndash; not comedy, that&rsquo;s fun too, but I want to do serious movies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael stated he always wanted a bike and was happy to now have one. This partly due to the success they had achieved since signing to Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On being asked by Judy whether people love them, Michael was quite diplomatic about it. Michael realised how much their fans loved them as they were always telling them, but said it didn&rsquo;t affect them and they just carried on being themselves.</span></p></body>
