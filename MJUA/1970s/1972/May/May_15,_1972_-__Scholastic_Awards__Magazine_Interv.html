They aren&rsquo;t active in any movements, and we don&rsquo;t want you creating any illusions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson 5&rsquo;s strategy, which would carry on throughout their career was to unite all colours and creeds with their music, and that&rsquo;s what very much happened. Jackie shared his thoughts on this:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Look, we appeal to both black and white. You can see little kids and adults at our concerts, and we play for all of them. We don&rsquo;t make black music or white music, or kid music or adult music; we make our sound for everybody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To Rauseo, it was Jermaine who came across as the most serious musician, although on the day of the interview Rauseo was scared witless as he was confronted by the site of &lsquo;Crusher&rsquo; his pet snake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael came across as a level headed young man as Rauseo spoke briefly with him. Although, mainly the focus of attention of the group, Michael didn&rsquo;t as he put it, hog the limelight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So where did the feeling come from in the songs he sang about love:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m singing about a girl, and I call her my sweet little sunflower, all I do is picture girls who I&rsquo;ve known like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the time of the interview The Jackson 5 were preparing to introduce Randy to the group, which would see him feature more prominently on TV and at their concerts.</span></p></body>
