		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jackson Five - Pranksters, Puppets?&quot; Article</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that &ldquo;Jermaine already [had] an album in the American Top 20&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Jermaine&rdquo; album was released on July 14, 1972.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;New Musical Express&rdquo; magazine (December 12, 1972)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Taunts that the Jackson Five are nothing more than carefully manipulated puppets just aren&#39;t borne out by the facts. Five minutes in the company of Michael Jackson will convince you that the precious talent just could not be programmed--he&#39;s got far too mischievous a nature.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As we talked, a flustered-looking photographer was clicking away like it was going out of fashion and as the man reloaded for another 36 shots Michael palmed one of his lenses and hid it up his shirt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What kind of cameras do you use?&quot;, asked Michael of the cameraman, drawing the man unsuspectingly into earnest conversation over types of lenses--until the sudden realization that his &pound;300 pride-and-joy lens had gone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was then Michael showed just how mature he is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Most kids of his age wouldn&#39;t have known when to stop but, sensing that the joe was at the point of turning nasty and into something less than amusing, he produced the missing lens with an impish grin and an innocent: &quot;Is this what you&#39;re looking for?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Turning to other matters at hand, Michael had this to say about the group&#39;s first U.K. visit: &quot;When we were on the plane, the captain came back and said there were 1,000 kids waiting for us at the airport. We&#39;d been told we were popular in England but we hadn&#39;t really believed it until then.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Judging by the crowds who haunted their every movement--leading to an elaborate security screening and sneaky maneuvers like whisking them out of the back door in mini-cabs while sending decoy limousines round to the front entrance--the Jackson Five&#39;s following here is primarily a teeny one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">... Michael would be more than capable of &nbsp;taking on drums were it not more beneficial to have him up front concentrating on singing and dancing his heart out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Then there&#39;s the visual side which comes over with just as much impact, as anyone who&#39;s witnessed their dazzling choreography and incredible stage clothes will know. This is carried over into TV via their cartoon series.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A new series of half-hour TV comedies is set for the New Year: &quot;I really enjoy doing TV. It&#39;s very different and demanding, having to do things over and over but it&#39;s good fun&quot;, says Jackie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Next summer we&#39;ll be making a motion picture too but I don&#39;t know anything about it as yet. We&#39;re aiming to be complete entertainers&quot;, added Jackie. Michael just grinned and planned his next prank.</span></p></body>
