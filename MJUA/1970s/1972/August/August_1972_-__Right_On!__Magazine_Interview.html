Younger brother Randy was having a piano lesson in another part of the house.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael began his conversation by saying how he felt lucky to have the privilege to visit different parts of the world and meeting different people. Michael particularly took notice of how different the reaction was to the music in different countries.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Success he said also brought other opportunities:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Also being successful at one thing gives me a chance to branch out &ndash; to develop my other interests. Like acting for instance &ndash; I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do that. But I know it&rsquo;s no good being impatient. I&rsquo;ve to wait until I&rsquo;m really good enough, or else I&rsquo;ll just make a fool of myself, and give it up altogether. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same with my drumming. I practise every day on the drums, cos&rsquo; one day I&rsquo;d like to play them on stage with the group.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke of his ambitions of song writing and had already written a few.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Everybody in the family is writing music now. I&rsquo;ve written a song called, &lsquo;Got To Be With You&rsquo;, and we&rsquo;re going to record it. Jermaine&rsquo;s written stuff for his solo album and we all wrote &lsquo;Our Brand New Thing&rsquo; together. Yes, I think we&rsquo;re going to be doing more and more of that in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s busy recording schedule didn&rsquo;t give him too much time for hobbies, but when he had a few days off he said he liked to learn different instruments like the drums, piano, guitar and Congas. He also loved riding his motorbike and playing basketball with his brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While the interview was running friend Donny Osmond rang. They discussed when they could play each other at basketball.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They really want us to play them at football, but we&rsquo;d know we&rsquo;d lose!&rdquo;</span></p></body>
