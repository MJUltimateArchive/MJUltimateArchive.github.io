		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Star&rdquo; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date of publication confirmed in Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (&ldquo;2nd August 1972&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Laurie Brannen, Star Magazine, &ldquo;&lsquo;Heavy&rsquo;: Lover or Killer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(As I drove up the long driveway to the gate of the J-5&#39;s Encino home. I can hear Black Girl, the J-5&rsquo;s guard dog, barking from her kennel. As I get out of the car, open the gate, and enter the patio I see Heavy, Michael&rsquo;s German Shepherd pup, dancing around on his hind legs! Michael comes walking toward me, wearing a yellow tank top and brown cord pants, smiling happily!)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &quot;Laurie, I see Heavy is as glad to see you as I am!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ME: &ldquo;I&#39;m real happy to see you both, too! For a pup, Heavy has a pretty loud bark! I&#39;ll bet you&#39;ll never have any problem with prowlers with him around!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &quot;No, Black Girl, our grown German Shepherd guard dog protects us fine. But, as a matter of fact, we do have a problem with Heavy. He loves people so much, and has such a sweet personality, that we can&#39;t decide if we should try to make a guard dog out of him or not.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ME: &quot;Can&#39;t he be gentle and still he a good guard dog?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &ldquo;It&#39;s not all that simple. A dog has to learn to be a guard dog by going to a special school for attack training. Actually, what they do is teach the dog to react in a mean way to strangers who may or may not be dangerous. For instance, if Heavy was trained as a guard dog, he would snarl, bark, and even try to bite someone he didn&#39;t know who came into our yard. That person might be just a harmless mailman!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ME: &ldquo;So you feel that the training Heavy would get at one of these schools would be bad for him?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &quot;I think that it would be cruel to take a dog with Heavy&#39;s sweet personality. and turn him into something he wasn&#39;t meant to he. It&#39;s kind of the same thing as putting some guy into the army who is real sensitive and gentle, putting a gun into his hand and trying to make him a good soldier. In the first place, it&#39;s probably not going to work, &#39;cause you can&#39;t change someone into something completely different, and in the second place, you would be causing that person a lot of pain and heartache making him do things he doesn&#39;t want to do!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s the same way with Heavy. If I sent him to guard dog school, I&#39;d be taking a dog who is loving and gentle, and trying to change him into a completely different dog. I just don&#39;t think it would he fair!&quot; ME: &ldquo;I can see what you mean, Michael! But why do you and your family think you have to have a guard dog?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &ldquo;Well, Dad always goes on concert tour with Jermaine, Marlon, Tito, Jackie, Randy, and me, and that leaves Mom and Latoya alone in the house while we&#39;re gone. Dad got Heavy to help Black Girl. He didn&#39;t dream that Heavy would turn out to be the super friendliest dog in the whole world!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ME: &ldquo;Is your Dad planning on sending Heavy to school to be a guard dog than, for sure?&quot; MICHAEL: &quot;He&rsquo;s leaving that decision up to me, since I spend more time with Heavy than anyone else in our family. He&#39;s kind of my dog. and my father wouldn&#39;t make any decision about Heavy without asking me ﬁrst.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ME: &ldquo;Well, Michael! I guess that leaves you with a hard decision, knowing that your family needs another guard dog for protection while you&#39;re on the road, and knowing that Heavy wasn&#39;t cut out to be that kind of dog!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &quot;I just don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do! I love Heavy very much, and I want him to he happy, to be the lover dog you see right here. But I also want to feel that my Mom and Latoya are safe, and that Heavy could be a killer if he ever had to be in an emergency. I sure could use some advice!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ME: &quot;STAR will ask your fans to write in and tell you what they think you should do, Michael!&ldquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: &quot;That would be right on! Heavy and I would really appreciate that!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(After our goodbyes, and a &quot;kiss&quot; on my cheek from Heavy, I walk down the long shady driveway. way. I look back to see Michael throwing a ball and Heavy wagging his tail, running after it! It hurts me to think of that happy, loveable dog becoming a mean killer. I wonder what the future will hold for both of them!</span></p></body>
