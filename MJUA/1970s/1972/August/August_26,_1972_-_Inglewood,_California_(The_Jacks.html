		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inglewood, California (The Jackson 5 US Tour)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Soul&rdquo; Magazine, Rosalind Goddard (October 23, 1972) (Image 001)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They probably started arriving about 6:45 that night in an army of automobiles of all sizes and makes... some of them with groups of friends, some with mothers and fathers, and some who were charged with the care of younger brothers and sisters &mdash; to be admonished with stern words if anything happened. It was sold out, according to the marquis and anybody with good sense wouldn&#39;t have been surprised... for this was the annual concert, live at the Forum, of the country&#39;s &mdash; and perhaps the world&#39;s &mdash; most talented young Black group, the Jackson Five. The time was perfect ...7:30... which kept in mind bedtimes of the smallest children as well as the tenuous nerves of unconvinced parents, who knew of the talent of the Jacksons, but who needed maybe just a little more &quot;proof&quot; to be really convinced.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once inside, the cavernous space of the Forum buzzed loudly with young voices rapping about Michael... what he was going to have on and how &ldquo;fiine&rdquo; he was and how &ldquo;baad&rdquo; he was &mdash; hoping that he would sing &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; and &ldquo;Got to be There&rdquo; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and all the rest, but mainly those, &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Brown, ebony and beige faces were framed by benaturalled, braided and pressed heads whose bodies were finely dressed in high-waisted pants, blazers, body shirts, long and short dresses befrilled and slinky. The youthful brothers were just as fine in their skinny tops and suits, cool perhaps to the hysteria of the &quot;chicks&quot; but really just as excited to check out the new stage routines of the Jackson brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was a family affair, too&hellip; and the youngest set probably outshone their older peers... there were the four and five and six year olds decked out in their Sunday best, with faces shining, holding tightly on to Momma and Daddy&#39;s hand, but pulling anxiously just the same so they could get to their seats and look around bright-eyed at the stage and wonder about the microphone&rsquo;s cords and other &quot;stuff&quot; on the stage... knowing some of it but maybe not all of it, asking Mom &ldquo;when was Michael coming on the stage.&rdquo; And then of course there were the sage seven, eight, nine, and ten year olds sitting together in pairs of otherwise... allowed a night out on their own to see their idols... and who giggled incessantly at passersby. And</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">whispering slyly among themselves about whether that was Tom Cross from KGFJ sitting behind them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So it was a kids&#39; show filled to capacity with avid fans whose undeniable allegiance and loyalty to their heroes was overwhelming! Decked out in Jackson Five buttons, posters, and souvenir booklets, they flocked to seats, holding fast to ticket stubs and waiting anxiously for the grand moment. Binoculars and cameras were clutched fast in hands ready instantly to capture the faces of each of the group.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The Undisputed Truth&quot; who preceded the Jackson Five were given a rousing but token response to their act which included their hits &ldquo;Smiling Faces&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa was a Rolling Stone&rdquo;, the response didn&#39;t quite equal the shrill screams as the lights dimmed and Johnny Soul, master of ceremonies introduced the Jackson Five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pandemonium? Yes! Spotlights merged continuously, sweeping the audience as the Jacksons performed their first routine. Heads bobbed, fingers snapped, and bodies undulated with the rhythm of the music. Michael moved upstage and then to each corner of the stage to tease groups of frantic girls who hung precariously from their balcony seats trying desperately to touch his hand... and it was this way repeatedly throughout the show until it would finally happen... a touch and screams were heard above the crowd as the lucky girls jumped up and down in a paroxysm of joy, to cherish forever that hand and those fingers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Needless it was an overwhelming success; the Jackson Five put on a beautiful show, precise and fluid in their fantastic routines and their fine singing. But the show was in the audience and the waves of good feelings one felt just observing almost 18,000 fans adore their heroes with a vigor unmatched anywhere... it was special.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Soul&rdquo; Magazine, David Gest (October 23, 1972) (Image 001)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five are still making hit records, selling millions of albums, filling up concert halls and maintaining the prestige they have held since &#39;69 when things just started cooking for these young lads. In late August they performed at the Inglewood Forum and once again Jacksonmania came alive as thousands of young ladies screamed out the names of Michael, Marlon, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and let&#39;s not forget the youngest brother Randy, who made his first California appearance. Their special stage charisma has not disappeared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is not hard to see why they are considered Motown&#39;s biggest act and why they receive so much attention. Their act is well choreographed and rehearsed. At times they seem so well rehearsed that they could loosen up a little bit to make their movements flow a bit more natural. They prance around on stage in an exciting manner, putting a lot of discipline into their act as well as their music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The show not only spotlighted the group as a whole, but also gave Michael and Jermaine a chance to prove themselves as singers. Michael Jackson had no trouble wailing out &ldquo;I Wanna Be Where You Are&rdquo; and &ldquo;Got To Be There&rdquo;. He moves like a little hurricane around the stage. moving from one end to the other to croon the young ladies sitting on the sides of the stage. At times he even stopped to shake their hands, making the crowd go wild for every movement and gesture he made. The song which was most effective was &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; as it really demonstrated his vocal power, ability, and charisma as a performer. He sang it smooth, touching, and hauntingly loud, in the manner of a true professional.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine is also coming into his own now with his first Motown album moving nicely up the charts. His voice also has a crystal clear freshness which radiates warmth. He sang &ldquo;I Found That Girl&rdquo; and his current single &ldquo;I Let Love Pass Me By&rdquo;. His rendition of &ldquo;Bridge Over Troubled Water&rdquo; proved to be very impressive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group went through many of their hit records including &ldquo;ABC&rdquo;, &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo;, &ldquo;Never Can Say Goodbye&rdquo;, &ldquo;Goin&#39; Back To Indiana&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Sugar Daddy&rdquo;. Each tune created a little nostalgia of a certain time or place or person. These songs have not lost the punch and bounce which have made them all classics.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Randy Lucifer Jackson was introduced about midway during their set and demonstrated his snapping young talent on the congas. For a kid of his age, he sure plays the drums exceptionally well, and one day could prove to be the main attraction of the group, if his voice is as good as his playing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group kept the moving through their hour and fifteen minute set without any lag. They closed with &ldquo;The Love You Save&rdquo; and proved that they still as popular as they ever were, and if they keep this up, they could possibly be another Mills Brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Undisputed Truth opened the first part of the show with tunes like &ldquo;Smiling Faces Sometimes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa Was A Rolling Stone&rdquo;. Their act could use some choreography (the kind which Motown affords most of their acts) and some tighter vocal harmonics. Their voices seemed very strong and the group shows a lot of potential.</span></p></body>
