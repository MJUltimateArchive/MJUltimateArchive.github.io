They had all been recording at Motown all day, and were ready to relax. They walked in with big smiles, and sank back in big comfortable leather chairs as I passed out cokes and pretzels. Michael and Marlon dug right into those pretzels!)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: Mike, let&#39;s talk about Jermaine first. DO you get along with Jermaine as well as with your friends?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: &quot;Jermaine and I have a lot of groovy times together! We get along really well and hardly ever fight like a lot of brothers with a big age difference do! Jermaine is the kind of older brother you can dig &#39;cause he&#39;s not the type that thinks he&#39;s smarter just because he&#39;s older!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;What do you dog most about Jermaine&#39;s music?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: &quot;The way he plays the bass and sings at the same time amazes me! Until I started my piano lessons, I had never played an instrument while I sang, and I think it is very hard to do! Maybe Jermaine&#39;s secret is the slow, cool way he moves on stage. People tell me that I jive around on stage so much that I wonder if I&#39;ll be able to play while I sing!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;What do you think is the thing that&#39;s most different between you and Jermaine?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: &quot;There&#39;s a big difference in the kind of girls we like. People say I&#39;m full of energy, and I guess that&#39;s why I like lively girls who laugh and talk a lot. Jermaine is more cool. He digs girls who are the foxy type, mysterious and quiet.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;Do you and Jermaine like singing together?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: &quot;Singing has made us even better friends because we spend so much time together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;It sounds like you&#39;re proud to be Jermaine&#39;s brother.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: &quot;Right-on! But I&#39;m also proud of him because he&#39;s a groovy person and an outtasight musician!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON TALKS ABOUT MICHAEL!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;Marlon, let&#39;s hear from you! I know that sometimes kids don&#39;t dig doing things with their brothers just &#39;cause they see a lot of each other. Do you and Michael spend much time together?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon: &quot;Besides being my brother, Michael is the best friend I&#39;ve ever had! We&#39;re about the same age, and we like to do the same things. Michael and I spend a lot of time together when we&#39;re on tour.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;What do you and Michael like to do when you&#39;re not on tour?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon: &quot;When we&#39;re at home, we love to take our mini-bikes into the hills on a sunny groovin&#39; day and race around. Next to singing and playing in the J-5, we like riding our mini-bikes more than anything else!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON TALKS ABOUT JERMAINE!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Me: &quot;Do you get along with Jermaine as well with Michael?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon: &quot;Yeah, we get along just as well, but it&#39;s kind of a different thing. Jermaine, being older, often...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Missing page]</span></p></body>
