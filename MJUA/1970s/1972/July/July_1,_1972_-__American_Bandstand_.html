Marvelous Mike revealed that his life had changed a lot since he and his brothers were &quot;unknown&quot; performers at local rallies in Gary, Indiana. In fact, now that he&#39;s recognized wherever he goes, Mike doesn&#39;t mind a [unintelligible] bit! You could say that he loves it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some other tasty tidbits that you might not have known: Mike wants to go to college and become a record producer! His fav groups are 3 Dog Night, the Staple Singers, and the Temptations. And, speaking of groups, Mike mentioned that he and his brothers have indeed met the Osmonds (last year in Canada) and hot to be quite friendly with them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout the show, Mike&#39;s and the J5&#39;s records were played as the groovy Bandstand gang danced and rocked to them. Mike sang &quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot; and &quot;Ben&quot; and</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">judged Bandstand&#39;s dance contest.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, suddenly--Marlon, Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine appeared on the scene, laden with J5 gold records. Dick and the boys talked about the J5 super successes, and these dynamic darlin&#39;s harmonized to &quot;Lookin&#39; Through the Windows&quot;. Wow! What a whopper of a show--and you gotta see it all!</span></p></body>
