Jermaine says, &quot;He wears them on every tour. It&#39;s his traveling shirt.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has a solo album out on Motown &quot;Got to Be There&quot;. A single from it. &quot;I Wanna Be Where You Are&quot;, was a hit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We ask him about singing love songs at his youngish age, and he says, &quot;It&#39;s not odd for me to sing love songs because I know what I&#39;m singing about.&quot; This brings laughs and snickers from his brothers. Jackie says, teasingly, He gets really deeply involved.&quot; Michael defends himself, &quot;There is no age limit to love.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...As the group talks, an adviser says, I never saw you guys so quiet.&quot; They explain that they have just flown to New York and are still geared to Los Angeles time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">About Rany, Jackie says, &quot;He has been dying to get in. He finally passed the test. He had to get his thing together first before he could join. He is okay now.&quot; He adds that the name of the group still is the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito and Jermaine play guitar. Michael mostly and also Jermaine are lead singers. A couple of cousins play organ and drums.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Asked if they ever compare themselves with the Osmond Brothers, Michael says, &quot;There is room for everybody.&quot; Jermaine says, &quot;We just compare ourselves with ourselves. We just keep trying--&quot; [article cuts off]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie says, &quot;There&#39;s only one way to go and that is up. We don&#39;t think about going down. Right, fellas? Right.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are also three sisters in the family, Maureen, La Toya, and Janet. Tito says, &quot;Our baby sister wants in show business.&quot; &quot;But no girls in the act&quot;, quickly adds Jermaine. &quot;We&#39;ll give her a little boost some other way.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group got its start in Gary, Ind., where the family lived until moving to California three years ago. Jackie says, &quot;We were amateurs. Everybody had groups competing against each other. We won a talent show. The mayor of Gary had Diana Ross for a guest at a benefit show and he invited us to sing. She told us she&#39;d take us to Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We sang the latest songs that were out, by the Temptations, the Miracles, the Supremes; whoever had a big tune on the charts, we&#39;d sing it. We sang in Berry Gordy&#39;s office at Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon says, &quot;When we were amateurs we played at the Apollo Theater a lot. We used to do five or six shows a day. We have spent Christmas at the Apollo&quot;, Jermaine says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Back then, that was what we wanted to do&quot;, Jackie says, &quot;We were just getting started so we were quite anxious. Back in &#39;64 or &#39;65 we started as amateurs.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is only the first of the brothers to come out with a solo album. He says, &quot;Jermaine is doing his thing. He&#39;s going to have a solo album. Everybody is going to have a solo album.&quot;</span></p></body>
