		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chicago, Illinois (The Jackson 5 US Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (July 23, 1972) (Images 001-002)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Astor Towers, in the rain. Outside, kids clutter the drive-proof once again that the groupie grapevine works in mysterious ways, but works--clutching autograph books, plucking the alcoves of anyone who looks like they could possibly be staying at the hotel and might be induced to coattail a kid through the doors. Inside, a couple of bored cops. And on the 17th floor, Michael Jackson, at 13 the youngest and giggliest of the original Motown mint group, surprisingly spontaneous sweetheart of synchronized soul...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And far more interested, on the eve of the group&#39;s two sold-out Amphitheater concerts last week, in the weather than the welter of activity below.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There&#39;s going to be a tornado,&quot; he announced with obvious relish, heading under a coffee table. &ldquo;I&#39;ve seen a couple of them back in Gary. Everybody has to get behind a door or under the table and do a whole number. That&#39;s what they&#39;d say on the radio.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh, that sounds more like what you&#39;d do for an earthquake,&rdquo; gently protested Rose Fine, Michael&#39;s tutor for two years [and, it would seem, up against a pedagogic Waterloo with his persistent preference for &ldquo;he don&#39;t&rdquo; over &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t&quot;). &quot;An earthquake, or something like that....&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No,&quot; Michael repeated firmly. &quot;I remember they&#39;d tell you to do it. On the radio. I remember in Indiana everyone would be behind their doors.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At any rate, it was back in Indiana where it all started &mdash;and longer ago than you or any of the hordes of J-5 fans, who&#39;ve snapped up the group&#39;s records by the millions since 1969 and &ldquo;I Want You Back,&rdquo; might suspect. It was three years ago that what Michael terms the &ldquo;big break&rdquo; came, when Motown&rsquo;s mistress of soul Diana Ross &quot;discovered&quot; the quintet at a Gary talent show [&quot;She came backstage, we said ooohhaah, that&rsquo;s Diana Ross, she say &#39;you good!&#39; and took us to Motown&quot;]. But papa Joe Jackson, at that time a Gary crane operator, had been putting his kids through their paces a long time before that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&rsquo;ve been dancing since I was 8 or 6,&quot; Michael says. &ldquo;Every day after school we&#39;d come home and dad would make us rehearse. Sometimes we&#39;d want to, you know, slack off and dad would make us practice. He&#39;d say, &#39;Practice makes perfect.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Our first show was at this place called the Big Top. It was a big store and they were having a sale and to get people in they&#39;d say such and such a group&#39;s going to be here. Then the people would come and buy something. Maybe some baby powder or something. A lot of people came. We did James Brown and Temptations stuff. Then we did talent shows, and little places&mdash; I remember Joe Cool&rsquo;s&mdash;and the Regal, and the Apollo. You ever heard of the High Chapparel? Or Bill Street? We used to play around there. We&#39;d sing and dance and people&rsquo;d throw money on the stage and we&#39;d gather it up. &ldquo;There used to be a lot of groups like that around Gary, but they&#39;d all split up, someone would get married or someone would get mad at someone else. When you&#39;re brothers, it&#39;s easier. You all live in the same house, you know what everyone&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and his brothers&mdash; Jackie, 20, Tito, 18, Jermaine, 17, Marlon, 18, and Randy, 9, who just got into the act&mdash;still have friends in Gary, but it has been three years since the family left that city for California and a home in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles, There, as on tour, there are the usual problems with security and overzealous fans. Michael takes it in stride:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Having crowds of people around trying to get at us doesn&rsquo;t bother me, though,&rdquo; Michael says. &quot;We all sign autographs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&#39;ve got a gate and a block long driveway in front of the house with a master button. People mash the button and talk to us. Some of them say, &lsquo;I don&#39;t want to grab you, I just want to be your friend.&rsquo; We let people in all the time to swim or play basketball, then we give them a picture and an autograph.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito no longer lives at home. He recently moved into an apartment a block or so away with his new bride; Michael&rsquo;s memories of their wedding center around eating cake and seeing his tutor dance with Lawrence Welk. &ldquo;Geritol, Sominex,&rdquo; he giggles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The senior Jacksons run a fairly tight ship, with little space for swelled heads. Each brother [and sister] gets a weekly allowance&mdash; Michael is up to $10&mdash;and is expected to manage it wisely. Everybody is expected to study hard in school, to help out around the house, to share in the care of the pets which threaten to outnumber the Jacksons: German Shepherds Lobo and Heavy, a wolf named Black Girl, Jeffrey the Mynah, Peter Rabbit, Tweety Chicken, and two boa constrictors&mdash;one Jermaine&#39;s, the other Michael&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just got my boa,&quot; Michael says. &quot;It&#39;s even bigger than Jermaine&rsquo;s, too. But I don&rsquo;t have my mice any more. They started multiplying and it got outrageous... They got loose in the house, too, millions of them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At home, Michael studies three hours a day with his tutor, just as he does on tour. In the winter, the Jacksons attend Walton, a private school in Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At first, they went to public school, but &quot;people not in the school used to come and run into the school and make noise and try to get our autographs, so now we go to a private school,&rdquo; Michael says. &ldquo;School&#39;s okay, I like studying art&mdash;I like to do oil paintings, abstracts (giggles). I didn&rsquo;t like the cafeteria at the public school, though. At the private school, they have a catering truck bring in the food. But it&#39;s like a jail, there are only two or three people in each class.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;After school, I mess around a lot at home. We don&rsquo;t go out too much. We don&#39;t have to go to a park or anything&mdash;we have everything at home. Basketball, swimming pool, pinball. Then there&#39;s a recording studio &mdash; soundproof &mdash; and the game room. That&#39;s my favorite room. And we have motorcycles and a lot of room to ride. I&#39;ve got one now but I&rsquo;m getting too big for it. I&rsquo;m trading that baby in for a Yamaha dirt bike.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sometimes we go out to movies or for Chinese food. I always have chicken chow mein because I don&rsquo;t really like Chinese food. They say it don&rsquo;t make you full. Jermaine had some today, and he said right after he ate he was hungry again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like soul food much either. Well, it&rsquo;s okay. Some of it. Barbecued ribs and pork and beans are okay. But not pigs&rsquo; feet or chitlins, and I hate neckbones. Cornbread&rsquo;s okay, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If females&mdash;the kind mill around outside the hotel during our interview and their counterparts that lurk outside the Jackson gates in L. A., &ldquo;mashing the button&rdquo; &mdash;don&#39;t seem to figure much in Michael&#39;s conversation, it&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t figure much in his life either. He wears a turquoise ring a girl got him at a swap meet, L.A.&#39;s version of the flea market. &ldquo;She paid $11 for it,&rdquo; he says. &quot;But she&rsquo;s just a friend. I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend yet.&quot; A bracelet coils around the wrist of his other hand. &quot;In Detroit, they call these slave bracelets,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;This one&rsquo;s real silver, tho. It don&rsquo;t make your wrist turn green. That one Reggie [the J-5 road manager) wears, it just turns your whole hand green.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has been on one date so far, a chaperoned outing with a girl he selected during a guest appearance on the Dating Game television show. &quot;We went out to dinner in New York.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Tell her what happened the *next* night,&quot; Reggie of the green wrist reminds Michael. This sounds more licentiously promising.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The next night we had a concert there and she came and was in the front row but everybody recognized her from television and started grabbing at her [giggles] and wanted her autograph [more giggles]. They had to put her backstage.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So it goes. At 13 going on 14&mdash;with plans to celebrate quietly in San Diego, where the tour will have taken the Jackson 5 come Michael&#39;s birthday Aug. 29&mdash;there&#39;s plenty of time for the superstud stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Time is, however, a commodity running out for his schoolboy soprano.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Michael says, &quot;I&#39;ve got future plans. I want to stay in music all my life, produce records, get in that bag. Everyone&rsquo;s voice changes. So when mine does, it won&#39;t be a big thing.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
