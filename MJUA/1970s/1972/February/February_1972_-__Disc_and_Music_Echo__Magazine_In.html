		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that the interview took place shortly before the March 1, 1972 airing of &ldquo;Hellzapoppin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rockin&rsquo; Robin&rdquo; had been released (was released on February 17, 1972) / Published March 18, 1972</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Disc and Music Echo&rdquo; magazine (March 18, 1972) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113847/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/disc_music_echo.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The most amazing thing about little Michael Jackson&#39;s solo success is how calmly he&#39;s taking it all. &quot;I think it&#39;s great&quot;, is all he says, talking from Los Angeles half an hour or so after finishing school for the day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Questioned about reasons behind him recording solo, he&#39;s pretty quick off the mark: &quot;It don&#39;t have nothing to do with me quitting the group. It&#39;s just that I wanted to do it&quot;, he says before you even get a chance to breach the subject of a split. &quot;I could never go solo, not with the group being a family thing. It would be like breaking away from the family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Anyway, the other guys are doing more solo things too. But we&#39;re still recording as a group. We&#39;re working on another album right now, which should be coming out shortly.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s hard not to suspect that Michael&#39;s solo career was partly prompted by the incredible success of Donny Osmond, young lead singer of the Osmond Brothers, who, as soon as The Jackson 5 broke adopted the same style and became equally as popular in America. But Michael denies it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, that had nothing to do with it. I just wanted to try it&quot;, he says. And considering this is his first interview on his own, his confidence is frightening. &quot;People seem to think that because the Osmond Brothers became big with records that sounded something like ours, we should have something against them. But it&#39;s not like that. I think they&#39;re a good group and don&#39;t have nothing against them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s solo success has more recently overshadowed the achievements of the group as a whole. For instance, it went almost unnoticed that, while Michael was resting at No. 1 in the American charts with &quot;Got To Be There&quot;, the group was only a few places below with &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Motown are going to make sure the group doesn&#39;t get ignored. There&#39;s a TV special planned--&quot;It&#39;s called &quot;Hellzapoppin&#39;&quot; and it&#39;s going to be really great&quot;--plus a tour of the U.S. in the Easter. Michael&#39;s looking forward to that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I really like appearing. The first time I went on stage I was [so scared?] but now I&#39;m never afraid. Sometimes I don&#39;t like leaving the stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Also, I enjoy touring because I like traveling. I like staying in different hotels and I like meeting different people. It&#39;s fun.&quot; He says he&#39;s always wanted most of all to get over to England and [illegible] to get here before the end of the year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A lot of people [illegible] have wondered whether his solo success was just a one-time thing, but he&#39;s actually showing that isn&#39;t the case at all. Right now he&#39;s back high in the U.S. chart with his second single &quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Actually the track was never planned as a single, it was just one of the tracks on his &quot;Got To Be There&quot; album but disc jockeys started playing it so much Motown were forced to lift it as a single. It should be another No. 1 hit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His album too is selling in great quantities... Michael doesn&#39;t have much say in the selection of his material &quot;but&quot;, he says, &quot;if I feel I&#39;d like to comment on a song, I do, and the producers take notice of what I say.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For a little man of such star status his outside activities are really quite down to earth. When he&#39;s not singing or recording he likes to play basketball or to draw.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He gets an allowance of five dollars a week and spends most of that on &quot;art supplies; paint and stuff like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mum and Dad Jackson have kept his feet firmly on the ground and never let all this fan worship and public limelight go to his head. Not that it seems it ever could. Asking about the future and he says: &quot;I hope to still be doing the same thing but I hope to go to college. I want to get a good education. That&#39;s very important.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s why the only time he gets for interviews is after-school hours and personal appearances have to be restricted to weekends and holidays.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse me now&quot;, he says, &quot;but I&#39;ve got to go to a session.&quot; You can be it wasn&#39;t an all-nighter either. Mum Jackson has Michael tucked up well before midnight.</span></p></body>
