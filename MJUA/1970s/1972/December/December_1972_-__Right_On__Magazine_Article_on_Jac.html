So this is the way we decided to do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And what a way it was! The beautiful Jackson home was just buzzing with excited people, all saying hello to Michael, Randy, Jackie, Marlon, Jermaine, Tito &amp; Dee Dee and of course, Papa Joe and Mama Katherine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Are you having a good time?&quot; Michael kept asking all his happy guests. The answer was obvious! Between all the delicious food and drinks the Jacksons had spread out by the backyard swimming pool, and all the groovy people to sit and chat with, you can be sure we were having a fantastic time&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Interview with Michael]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I&#39;m up there, in front of all our fans, and I&#39;m into a song I can really feel, like &quot;Ben&quot; or something, the thing that drives me is my love for singing&quot;, says 14-year-old Michael Jackson, when we asked him about his sensational stage performances.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I say &#39;love for singing&#39;, I hope that doesn&#39;t sound corny or anything. Because I really mean it. Singing is one of the most important things in my life. It&#39;s the way I&#39;ve found to get all my deepest feelings across to the people I love.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Watching Michael do this thing onstage, you quickly realize that no amount of money or fame could make anyone give so much! It could only be love that drives Michael. His energy is just too great, too open, too beautiful to be anything else.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I know when we&#39;re finished with a show, when I&#39;m backstage and all that music and yelling is suddenly over, I sometimes feel a little lost. It takes me a few minutes to get my head back together. The whole thing is so overwhelming, it just takes time to return to normal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Some performers don&#39;t mind sorta winging it onstage&quot;, a close friend of Mike&#39;s confided. &quot;But not Michael! I remember the first time I saw the J-5 live--Michael really blew my mind. I said to him after the show: &quot;Hey man, you don&#39;t mess around up there, do you?&quot; And he just looked at me and laughed: &quot;Mess around? That&#39;s not what I&#39;m up there for!&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It sure isn&#39;t!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Right On&rdquo; magazine (December 1972), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several stars, including Michael, Jackie, Marlon and Jermaine, along with Ricky Sylvers and Aretha Franklin, were asked what their kind of friend was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said that his kind of friend was someone who enjoyed being with him and not seduced by the showbiz world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I dig easy going people. People who you can act natural around. That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s at for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Joe Jackson, father, &ldquo;Right On&rdquo; Magazine (December 1972) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808114838/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/rightinon2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe Jackson is a very groovy dude--there&#39;s no doubt about it! When Right On was invited out to visit Joe in his family&#39;s beautiful Encino home. we just couldn&#39;t wait to find out what the father of The Jackson Five was really like. He seemed cool. He seemed wise. He seemed strong. He seemed like a man who would have to be super special--otherwise, there just couldn&#39;t be anything as together as The Jackson Five. And of course, Joe turned out to be exactly what he leaned!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a casual walk around the Jackson&#39;s tree covered backyard, and a delicious glass of lemonade (thank you lovely Katherine Jackson, the J-5&#39;s mother), we settled down for our chat in between all the cords and microphones that decorate the J-5&#39;s own personal &quot;music room&quot; (a room they built for their rehearsals).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Future Recording Plans</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&lsquo;m thinking about turning this room into a kind of recording studio.&quot;, Joe said, pointing out how the room could be easily converted. &quot;That way the boys could tape some of their stuff right here. We could also record other young singers that we thought were good. We already use the room to make practice tapes. That helps a lot.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What&rsquo;s that mirror for?&quot; I asked Joe, noticing that one of the walls had been converted into a huge mirror.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh, that&#39;s so that the boys can see how they&#39;re doing when they practice.&quot;, Joe answered. Then he quickly added: &quot;However, towards the end of their rehearsal periods, we draw those drapes closed so that they don&#39;t become too dependent on watching their dance steps and stuff. They have to start *feeling* when they&#39;re together and when they&#39;re not. For example, Marlon and Michael can get out of step for a second, and if they&#39;re using the mirror, they can immediately see that something&#39;s gone wrong and correct it. That&#39;s fine for early rehearsals. But there isn&#39;t going to he any mirror out there for them when they&#39;re performing before a live audience, right?&quot; So the boys have to learn to feel when they&#39;re together and when they&#39;re not/ As you could see during their tour last summer, they really do find ways of keeping those complicated dance steps together!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Obviously Joe Jackson is a very proud father! And who wouldn&#39;t be? Watching literally thousands and thousands of dedicated fans flip right out when his sons &quot;do their thing&quot;, well, it&#39;s just mind-blowing, even if he is their father.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">DID DIANA ROSS REALLY DISCOVER THE J-5?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Tell me&quot;, I asked, &quot;is there any real truth to the Diana Ross story? Did she really &#39;discover&#39; The Jackson Five or what?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Let me put it this way&quot;, Joe said slowly. &quot;We were at the gate. To me it seems that there is an iron gate into the entertainment field, and there has to be a way to open that gate before you can get through, before people are willing to accept you in this field. We were one foot through the gate and one foot out. What Diana Ross did was more or less open that gate for us. Yes, as far as I&#39;m concerned, that gate was opened for The Jackson Five by Miss Ross.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WHY WERE THE J-5 GOOD RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Watching Michael, Randy, Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon, and Tito on stage and off, it&#39;s no surprise that their magic comes from deep within. The family is special. There&#39;s just no way of getting around that fact. I had to ask Joe why he thought his sons were good right from the git-go. &quot;The boys obeyed! They would always listen and try to do anything that I would tell them to do. This means a great deal in the world of music, because it is understanding that counts. And you can&#39;t understand anything unless you&#39;re disciplined, unless you can take direction from someone else. Of course this doesn&#39;t mean that they just did what they were told and that was that. Obviously my sons have a lot inside then to give! But you have to be able to have some kind of an understanding with the musicians you&#39;re working with and this means discipline.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">HOW DID THE J-5 GET THEIR NAME?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe smiled, &quot;Well, I used to call them &#39;THE JACKSON BROTHERS&#39;. Did you know that? One day we were doing some show in a department store in Gary--I think Michael was all of five at the time--and this model who had us on her show, Evelyn Lehey, said to me: &#39;Joe, The Jackson Brothers sounds a little old fashion. Why don&#39;t you call them the Jackson Five?&#39; I thought that sounded like a good idea. and that&#39;s what we started to call them all the time: THE JACKSON FIVE.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What about Randy?&quot; I asked, &quot;Will Randy make six or what? Will you just keep the same name anyway?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RANDY WON&#39;T MAKE THE GROUP: THE J-6</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We have to keep the same name. See, it&lsquo;s a name that went down so big and so many people know us by THE JACKSON FIVE. The actual number in the group really doesn&#39;t matter. We have great plans for Randy because Randy&#39;s very, very talented! He plays the congos and drums and he&#39;s playing the piano fantastically. He studies a lot and seems to like what he&#39;s doing--and boy, does he catch on fast. I&#39;d like to see Randy go into the writing and arranging field of music, because he seem to have a special ear for all that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL&#39;S THE #1 LEADER</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite all Joe&#39;s enthusiasm for Randy, there&#39;s little doubt who he feels leads The Jackson Five:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael has always had the talent for being a leader. He doesn&#39;t play any instruments onstage, so he can run around and get close to the fans. Being a natural leader, he&#39;s always been into moving around and making gestures with his hands, dancing, spinning around, while the rest of the boys sort of stand in the background playing and singing. Michael was always the smallest and the swiftest, and he could dance the best and sing very, very well. It&#39;s just the way he&#39;s cut.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE SINGS TO AN OLDER AUDIENCE</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jermaine sings to a much older audience.&rdquo; Joe continued. &quot;Michael sings to the little ones--Randy too, but Jermaine is getting a very special audience. It&#39;s been happening slowly, but it is happening. Tito and Jackie play a major part to background harmony. You see that&#39;s not to he ignored! If your background singing doesn&#39;t sound good, then your leads can&#39;t lead!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JOE REMAINS IN CHARGE OF HIS SONS!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Summing up his part in forming and keeping The Jackson Five&#39;s magic. Papa Joe told us:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You see, my sons were never allowed to run the streets like a lot of other kids did. They were never out all times of the night. They always had to be in just when it would start to get dark and we knew where they were at all times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They never went riding around in different cars with different kids and they never got into any kind of trouble! Their record is clean and we hope to keep it clean! As a father you have to stand behind your kids and talk to them and help them learn what is right and what is wrong. It&#39;s hard, because often they don&#39;t understand--but when they get older, they realize. They see what&#39;s happening.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yes, the Jackson brothers have much to be grateful for with a father like Joe Jackson--and the nicest part is that they know it!</span></p></body>
