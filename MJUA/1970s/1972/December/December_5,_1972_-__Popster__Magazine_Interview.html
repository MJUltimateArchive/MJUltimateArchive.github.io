At thirteen, he was an international big name. He was fourteen on August 29, 1972... and not only growing upwards and outwards physically, but his reputation is also, incredibly, still growing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He&#39;s a Virgo man. And when you meet him, it&#39;s no surprise to find that Virgo characters should be modest, industrious, energetic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He says: &quot;I don&rsquo;t feel like a star. I feel like a youngster who has a lot to learn--&#39;bout living, &#39;bout my business&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the show-biz experts say there&#39;s nothing the kid can&#39;t do as he gets older... like being another Sinatra, or another Sammy Davis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael would like to be a Sidney Poitier one day. &quot;That guy is just a great, great actor&quot;, he says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve seen all his movies. He gets intensity through to his audiences audiences... we try to do that with our music&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This superstar Jackson never stays still for long. One minute he&#39;ll be drawing cartoons, listening to records at the same time... Ray Charles &quot;Georgia&quot; can be guaranteed to bring tears of admiration to his eyes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He digs Three Dog Night, too. He loves the ballad voice of Johnny Mathis; the excitement of James Brown... and can imitate both of them to perfection!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he&#39;s a terrific practical joker. When he and brother Marlon get together with a touch of wickedness in their eyes... well, anything can and does happen!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was the first Jackson to make a solo record, so maybe it was only natural that people thought he might be going solo for good.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Nope&quot;, he says, and he&#39;s real serious now. &ldquo;it&#39;s just that we have different sides to our nature, our personality--and so we do our own things, then we&#39;re only too glad to get back together again as a group&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has been singing since he was four. He remembers some of the first records he heard and his own efforts to sing along with them--like Drifters on &ldquo;Under the Boardwalk&ldquo;, and that Isley Brothers&#39; oldie &ldquo;Twist and Shout&quot;, which was later to become a vital part of the Beatles&#39; act.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And as he got up to his &#39;teens, people were amazed at how he could sing songs of love, romantic things, and make it sound like he was baring his soul...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I do talk a little on stage about how I come to feel the blues&quot;, he says. &quot;I get a song, work it over in my mind a little, and it comes out... I don&lsquo;t force it. It just comes out. But I listened a lot, too. I became a blues singer by ear, I guess. Just played it by ear.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he adds: &ldquo;We work to get our sound, and then do it on stage and it&#39;s drowned by all the screaming. That doesn&#39;t worry us. It&#39;s that audience reaction that helps us work. Those fans are part of the act, too, you know.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the family lived in Indiana, Michael liked to go up into the hills and just sort of soak up the quiet. He&#39;d catch lizards, then let them go. He&#39;s mad on animals of all shapes and sizes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now he&#39;s by no means a loner. &quot;When I&#39;m not working. I like to have people round me. But that&#39;s no problem--everybody in our family is my best friend, so I&#39;m never lonely.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and the others live in a super twelve-room house just an hour&#39;s fast drive from Hollywood and they have their own swimming-pool, basketball arena, plus volleyball, pin-table machines, recording studio, menagerie (that&#39;s for Michael!).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So they don&#39;t go out to find a good time; and anyway it&#39;s not so easy for pop superstars just to stroll round town, window- shopping or visiting the local drugstore.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Says Michael: &ldquo;When I do go out, I generally have a security man with me. or my own chauffeur or whatever.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But don&#39;t make it sound like I&#39;m some kind of prisoner. I&#39;ve had a lot of lucky breaks so far, and it&#39;s no hardship that I&#39;m sometimes not as free as if i was unknown...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since childhood, Michael has got his education where he can--on tour, at home with special tutors, anywhere. But you only have to talk with him for a few minutes to realise that he&#39;s a clever and shrewd boy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He&#39;s seen a lot of the world already. He can remember when the family had no money--and that helps you live with big money when it arrives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;m lucky&quot;, he says simply. And he says it like he sings - with soul, and from the heart.</span></p></body>
