On Christmas morning they get up and begin with a good hearty breakfast of bacon, egg, fried potatoes, toast and jam, hot chocolate and a special Christmas coffee cake with walnut frosting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We all come to the table in our bathrobes and pyjamas and our dad plays Christmas music on our stereo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael says Jermaine is always the one to leave the table first to put on his special gear for special occasions. Everyone soon follows the same. When the rest of the family arrives, cousins, uncles and aunties, they all gather around the tree laughing and talking. Michael says they all give each other joke presents first before presenting the real ones. One year Jermaine&rsquo;s jokes gift to Michael was a comb so as he wouldn&rsquo;t have to keep borrowing his.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sometimes our fans send gifts right to our house and we open them up with our family on Christmas morning. These are gifts we can&rsquo;t wait to open, &lsquo;cause we know our fans put a lot of special thought in to them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The family go to Church before they return for mother Katherine and his aunts to prepare dinner. Michael&rsquo;s always the first at the table, something Jermaine teased him about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This later followed by the brothers giving a family concert with everyone joining in. Michael says he looks forward to one day sharing Christmas with a special girl.</span></p></body>
