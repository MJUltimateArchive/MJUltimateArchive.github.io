Motown executives and employees omitted having their annual Employee Christmas Party In favor of making die holiday season happier for those less fortunate and needy by having a Children&#39;s Christmas Party at the Pacific Town Club. Mary Wilson, of The Supremes, led the youngsters in singing carols and playing of games, before the arrival of the Jackson 5 dressed in Santa Claus costumes. Commenting on the gala affair, Miss Wilson said, &quot;I found It difficult to decide whether the youngsters got a bigger kick out of seeing their idols or whether the J-5 were more delighted about distributing more than 700 bags of gifts and records to the enthusiastic children. But it is certain that a good time was had by all who attended, especially me.&quot; Among the 700 invited youngsters who attended the party were representatives from the Mafundl Institute, the Frederick Douglass Head start Center, the Faustina Home for Girls, Harambee, the SCLC, the Urban League Headstart Center and other community organizations. Just two weeks ago, the Jackson 5 entertained more than 400 blind youngsters at a live performance hosted by the Southern California Foundation for the Junior Blind, On Jan. 12, they will again show their concern for community Involvement by headlining at the First Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Birth day Commemoration Concert in Atlanta.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
