He appeared to grasp the censors of opinion on describing Michael perfectly. On stage he witnessed a bundle of energy commanding the stage like a seasoned performer beyond his years. But when he got the chance to meet him off stage, he witnessed a rather more private and reserved person.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pete interviewed Michael at the Churchill Hotel, in London where the Jackson 5 was staying during their first British shows in November, 1972. Michael had sat quietly as the interviewer was getting prepared with his questions, that was until he saw the reporter&rsquo;s fountain pen, which seemed to capture his attention.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What sort of pen&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Michael enquired.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The pen was an old Parker 51. &ldquo;How does it work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Having had it explained to him Michael&rsquo;s response was full of mischief and somewhere down you the line you could imagine his brothers were going to be the victims of one of his pranks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You could squirt that through a keyhole couldn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Michael grinned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pete learned that Michael had discovered a lot of things he liked in Britain while he was visiting. He liked a brooch he&rsquo;d seen of a train a girl was wearing and also several tee shirt designs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael planned to decorate his bedroom with posters when he returned back to California.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Posters are the only thing I&rsquo;ve brought with my pocket money. Usually, I save it. Or spend it on postcards when we&rsquo;re touring. That way, when I get home, I&rsquo;ve got lots of pictures to remind me of where we&rsquo;ve been. It&rsquo;ll be nice to get home again, of course, because touring is very tiring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said he wanted to spend more time in Britain on future visits. Next time he stated he wanted to take in more sites and shops.</span></p></body>
