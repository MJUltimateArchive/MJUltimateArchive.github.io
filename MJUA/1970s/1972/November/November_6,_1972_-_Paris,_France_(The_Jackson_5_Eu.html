So in San Francisco, where they were performing this summer, Emmanuel Choisnel could not enter: the 30,000 seats were rented! This success, the Jackson Five are still far from knowing it in France and it is natural to the extent that they represent a &quot;product&quot; essentially intended for the American market. We will come back to it. Nevertheless the Olympia was full that night, the &quot;beautiful people&quot; - African and West Indian - was at the rendezvous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &quot;Jackson Five Show&quot; opened on a group of R &amp; B English, the Orange Rainbow whose style is obtained by the resumption of success of Sly and the Family Stone, Isaac Hayes, etc. With poor singers and honest musicians, the group still broke their teeth on &quot;Shaft&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The orange rainbow also had the task of accompanying the Sisters Love who have just signed with Tamla after recording for Man Child and A &amp; M. This group originally consisted of ex-Raelets (of which Merry Claytona now includes Lillie Ford, Jeannie Long, Gwen Berry and Vermettya Royster.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On stage, they show a profession proven but still new enough to leave room for some improvisation and humor. Each of the sisters is able to take the role of soloist in a particular register: the little Gwen Berry sings with the conviction that already animated it at Ray Charles; Jeannie Long, longiform (!) Shows tremendous vocal possibilities with a lot of nonchalance; Lillie Ford, naughty, does not lack temperament. As for Vermettya Royster, who appears as leader of the group, she has all the qualities of a great singer: superb voice and extraordinary slaughter. Obviously, she went through the gospel choir and kept the flame. All these individual qualities make Sisters Love a valuable group, able to reach the first places. For this, they will one day find a repertoire that hangs. They too often sank into banal ballads that did not even have the excuse of having pretty melodies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After settling in the dark under the ovations of an already conquered audience, the Jackson Five appeared radiant, all dressed in brightly colored suits. Tito and his guitar on the left, Jermaine and his bass on the right, framing Marlon, Jackie and Michael. The rest of the orchestra consisted of a drummer (Johnny) and an organ pianist (Randy), cousins! We have the family spirit or we do not have it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The show of the J5 as that of the big stars of RNB is adjusted to perfection: perfect implementation, amazing choreography, juggling with microphones, gags studied. Today we have some experience with James Brown or Ike &amp; Tina. But what is surprising here is to find such a safety, such a job for boys as young, who three years ago were going very nicely to school.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the hour that will last their performance we will attend a great festival both musical and visual. Of course, the star is this phenomenon of Michael, a real showman who at thirteen already has all the tricks of the trade and sings with great enthusiasm the success that has become: ABC, I&#39;ll Be There, Goin &#39;Back To Indiana, Lookin &#39;Through The Windows, Rockin&#39; Robin. Jermaine, bassist, will be an excellent singer with a mature voice and very soul. The other brothers have a less brilliant role but nevertheless essential, because the J5 are above all a group: the choirs have a great importance, as well as the stage set as a real ballet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Musically, the Jackson 5 bring nothing new. These are not the few exceptions to the rule (Lookin &#39;Through The Windows) or the tricks of the guitar wah-wah who must abuse us: their music is related to that of the vocal groups of the 50s (doo whap doo whap) as 5 Satins, Platters, Charms, Robins etc. And it is not insulting to Diana Ross&#39;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;s to say so. On the contrary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Note that the group has added a new member in the small person of Randy Jackson, 9, who typed with a good conviction on his bongos. Jackson Six then!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We have to stop for a moment on the &quot;Jackson Five phenomenon&quot;. How did this family group become so popular in two or three years? Talent does not explain everything. I think a lot more than it meets a kind of need of the American public. If one had asked a computer, after a serious market study, what this audience wanted, he would probably have answered: a friendly group, even touching (children or teenagers), no protest for two cents, spectacular if possible. The only thing left for the group to do was to sponsor them by an established star and propel them to great publicity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Soul&rdquo; newspaper (January 18, 1973)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fourteen-year-old Michael rates Paris as the trip&#39;s highlight. He dug the clear and sunny Parisian weather, the delicious cuisine, and he got a chance to practice his classroom French.</span></p></body>
