He sat around Editor Sharon Lee&#39;s office just talking and passing the time and Sharon would like to share a few of his thoughts with YOU!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Michael, do you ever think about writing any song or have you written any that have been recorded or will be?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I&#39;ve written a song that&#39;s going to be recorded soon called &quot;Got To Be With You&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Do you think the J-5 are going to change a lot in their music because you&#39;re all starting to write now and you&#39;re getting more involved in the music part of it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah, we&#39;re learning more, but, like, the way we&#39;re doing it isn&#39;t going to change. We&#39;re learning more but it&#39;s not going to change.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: The solo album, how does that affect what&#39;s going to happen now? Everybody&#39;s writing in saying, &quot;Is Michael leaving the group? Is someone taking his place?&quot; What&#39;s happening with all that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: It has nothing to do with splitting up because while I was doing the album, everybody was there listening. And as a matter of fact, Jermaine is doing his own album, Tito&#39;s doing his own thing, Jackie&#39;s doing his thing and Marlon&#39;s doing his. This has nothing to do with breaking up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: What about your girlfriends? Haven&#39;t they changed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I don&#39;t have any. I&#39;m still too young and I&#39;m always busy, too!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: What about Randy now? Is that going to make any changes in the music? What kind of thing happens when he comes out on stage? I know you&#39;ve been kind of sneaking him on every now and then. What do you feel happens with the audience and how do you feel about him being the youngest now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I think it&#39;s good. Everybody jumps up and they like it. That&#39;s our brand new thing. We do a whole medley with him. He&#39;s in the group because he&#39;s always been trying real hard. He used to practice with us in Gary, Indiana, playing bongos and now he plays congas. He&#39;s happy and I&#39;m really happy about his being in the group!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: What do you do when you&#39;re not rehearsing and you&#39;re not at school?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Watch television or swim or play things in the Music Room like the drums, piano, guitar, and congas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: I read something once where you were saying you played the drums a little bit but you were a little nervous doing it because you didn&#39;t really feel sure yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah, because I really didn&#39;t know how to play at first, but now I plan to get into it more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: What about your brothers, are they changing instruments at all?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: We&#39;re all learning how to play different things. Like Jackie&#39;s talking harp, Marlon plays saxophone now, Randy&#39;s having his piano lessons now and Tito and Jermaine know how to play all instruments.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: What song did you like the best and did you know when you were recording it that it was really going to be good?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: My favorites are &quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot;, and &quot;I Want You Back&quot;. I knew &quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot; was going to be really good.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Somebody told me that you talk a lot to Donny Osmond or is that just a rumor?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah. He calls me sometimes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: If you&#39;re friends, what do you talk about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: He&#39;s always talking about football and he wants to play a game with us. We&#39;re getting that together. I&#39;m sorry, not football but basketball. They say they&#39;ll probably beat us in football but we can play everything including baseball!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: What kind of girl would you think you would like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: A girl with a good personality. Like, you wouldn&#39;t get a girl and marry her in one day, would you? Well, you have to talk with her, see what she&#39;s like and ask a few questions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Do you have any special problems being one of the Jackson-5?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Problems? I don&#39;t have any problems--not a one. I guess the worst one would be if I was conceited, but I don&#39;t have those kind of problems now... maybe when I get older.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Have you ever wanted to go into the movie business?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I&#39;d like to be in a movie one day, but I mainly like to sing. I want to be with the group, singing, all my life!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Do you do any cooking at all?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah, you know, grits, oatmeal, bacon, eggs, Cream of Wheat. I like enchiladas best but I can&#39;t cook them yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: How do you feel when you hear yourself singing on the radio?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I&#39;ve been asked about that a lot of times. I don&#39;t feel any different, I just listen to it. I don&#39;t tell people, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s me.&quot; I would feel funny if I said that, you know, because there are some people I know who are jealous, and I don&#39;t like to make them feel that way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: Most reports say that your favorite singer is James Brown. Is this true?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: He&#39;s good. I like his records--the funky ones and the jazzy stuff. When we went to see a show of his, he taught me a few things he does on stage, you know, drop the mike and catch it. It only took me about thirty minutes to learn that... yeah, it looks hard, but it&#39;s easy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sharon: How do you like working with your brothers, Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Jackie, he keeps the group together for practice, Jermaine can really play that guitar and Tito, he&#39;s got heavy ways but doesn&#39;t like comedy stuff or cartoons. They get too serious sometimes. Marlon sticks around with me all the time. I can always be with him, and Jermaine is sometimes funny. He clowns with us.</span></p></body>
