The Jackson 5 had kicked off their summer tour receiving the key to New York City from Deputy Mayor Edward Hamilton.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke about having Randy on stage with them for the tour:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Randy is driving them wild. He&rsquo;s really, really good! We&rsquo;re so proud of him. Wow! This was his first real tour with us and he&rsquo;s been waiting so long to get up there with us that when he finally did &ndash; POW!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A funny moment at the shows was when they came to play &lsquo;Never Can Say Goodbye.&rsquo; On past tours this normally led to the guys getting ready to leave the stage, but this time they were due to end with a different number. Jermaine said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They thought we were about to split so they mobbed the stage and then we&rsquo;d have to leave. This happened to us at almost every concert stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Keeping Up with Michael Jackson&rdquo; article:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This Right On article covers a variety of topics from &lsquo;Michael&rsquo;s changes&rsquo;, to &lsquo;new songs take longer to record&rsquo; to &lsquo;I learned to dance watching.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael admitted there had been some changes since they had left Gary. The obvious being they now lived in a much larger house and rehearsed a lot more.Remembering Gary, Michael said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In Gary we always had to walk a couple of miles to a basketball court when we wanted to play. Now all we have to do is walk outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On new songs taking longer&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The brothers normally travelled by bus or in Jackie&rsquo;s car to the studio. When they get there it can take anything from 25 minutes to two hours to record a song, this all depended on whether it was a song they already knew or if it was a new one to learn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael recorded the lead first for his brothers later to lay their vocals on. Ironically at the time Michael said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really hot to do solo work. I&rsquo;d much rather keep singing with my brothers. I don&rsquo;t want to do any solo concerts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was keen to act one day, which was now becoming a common answer during many of his interviews. In the meantime Michael stated that he was writing regularly and hoped to release something of his own.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;So far we haven&rsquo;t recorded anything I&rsquo;ve written, but I&rsquo;m saving them. I think someday we&rsquo;ll be recording a lot of songs, too. Jermaine&rsquo;s been writing songs, too. It&rsquo;s a really groovy thing to get into&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael explained that a lot of the groups dancing came from studying other people. The family used to watch TV a lot and try and incorporate a lot of what they learned into their own choreography.</span></p></body>
