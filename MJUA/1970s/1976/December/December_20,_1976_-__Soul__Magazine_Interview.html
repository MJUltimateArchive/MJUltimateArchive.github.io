Sitting in on this Soul Train interview were Rebbie and La Toya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Maureen, aka Rebbie to her family, had been devoting her time to Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness, as well as sewing and interior decorating, of which she had been helping brother Marlon and his wife Carol on with their home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rebbie joined the family on their Las Vegas dates, coming out of her own secure family unit to appear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">La Toya enjoyed being with her family and being on stage with them. She said she found it hard having a boyfriend as she didn&rsquo;t trust anyone, but was not worried about the situation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, having just arrived back from a recording session with his brothers, joined in with Tito&rsquo;s observation of black music being categorised when it shouldn&rsquo;t be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But black radio stations won&rsquo;t play white music. Well, they&rsquo;re just beginning to. And they won&rsquo;t let white artists play on Soul Train. But then white people are the ones who set up the rules.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The brothers were all open to branch out into other things away from music. Randy was keen to try acting. Michael joked:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yeah he wants to be another Mantan Moreland. Another Stepin Fetchit.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
