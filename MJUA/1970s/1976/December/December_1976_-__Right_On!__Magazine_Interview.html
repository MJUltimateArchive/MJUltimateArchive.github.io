Their single &lsquo;Enjoy Yourself&rsquo; had been performed exclusively on the Cher show on 10th October and there was a lot to discuss with old friend Cynthia Horner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Highlights from the interview included:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the new album:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s nice about this particular album is the fact that it&rsquo;s more mellow, more rounded out, and more for everybody. I do most of the leads but the other guys come in and out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the wait to record with their new producers Gamble and Huff, due to the ending of their Motown contract, the brothers went camping in the California Sequoias and enjoyed games of volleyball.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spent time writing new songs, horse riding and taking photographs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What type of girls he likes:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I like all types of girls. But I like quiet girls the best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the fans touching him:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In London they grab your hair.

It&rsquo;s true. He won&rsquo;t talk to guys.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Cynthia Horner, &ldquo;Right On!&rdquo; magazine editor, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.vibe.com/2011/06/michael-jackson-vs-prince-oral-history"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (June 25, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190724184529/https://www.vibe.com/2011/06/michael-jackson-vs-prince-oral-history"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met Michael back in 1976 and he was one of the shyest people that I&rsquo;ve ever dealt with. It was a little difficult to interview him because even though as a professional entertainer he realized he needed the press, he wasn&rsquo;t somebody that knew how to relate to the media in terms of being open with information. He was just super shy unless he was around his family. But he picked up the fact I was shy as well, so he kind of embraced me and we became friends. He and Prince were quite similar because Prince was shy as well. If you were a journalist he would give you the same monosyllabic answers that Michael did. But Prince would also speak in riddles a lot of the time; he was very evasive. He would never answer any of my questions [laughs]. He wanted to keep his privacy protected at all cost.</span></p></body>
