I remember the palm trees in Los Angeles. When we moved there, from Gary, my brothers and I had never seen a real palm tree before, only on television. I enjoy visiting lots of places like Buckingham Palace, because I can write reports about them. But wherever I travel, whether it&rsquo;s Chicago, Mexico City or Manila, I love meeting the children. Really, they are no different from kids in the United States. I remember when we performed in Tokyo, Japan. The kids couldn&rsquo;t understand our language, but they certainly understood our music.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&ldquo;We were visiting in the land of thrilla-in-Manila. Muhammad Ali had just fought there and he told us that it was a beautiful city with lots of friendly people. That was true, but on our first day, we had a real thrill. The city was struck by an earthquake! I headed right for the door when the concert hall started shaking. But since Los Angeles has earthquakes too, I wasn&rsquo;t really that afraid. [...] The world is real big. Big and very different. I can&rsquo;t say where I liked it best, but I am happy to have seen so much of it by now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
