Yet the five brothers and three sisters who are starring in &quot;The Jacksons&quot; this summer on CBS-TV deliberately opted for a 30-minute format. &quot;We were offered an hour, but we decided to do half an hour,&quot; explains Michael Jackson, who soared to fame six years ago as lead singer of the Jackson Five. He&#39;s now all of 17. &quot;We&#39;d rather just give them (the audience) a little — make them want more. Then they&#39;ll be ready for us next week.&quot; The Jackson clan was offered a weekly series by ABC two years ago but Michael says they turned it down because they were just too busy recording and touring to devote themselves to a one-hour TV show each week. They still are, he notes — another reason for the 30-minute format. The family was able to knock off the four CBS summer shows — the second of which airs tonight — in less than three weeks. Jackson says the musical clan is more willing to accept a long-running series commitment now — &quot;there&#39;s a TV craze goin&#39; on&quot; — but if CBS wants them as a midseason replacement this winter, it will have to take them at half an hour. Whether the network will buy the concept permanently he isn&#39;t sure, but he believes the channel-hopping public will. &quot;America is on the move.&quot; he declared. &quot;It&#39;s hard to make &#39;em sit still for an hour unless something goin&#39; on - like somethin&#39; dirty.&quot; The latter came with a sly grin from the shy high school senior. He spoke quietly at a table beside the swimming pool at the tree-shrouded home where he lives with his parents and three siblings. His pet parrot squawked loudly from its nearby cage. The five oldest sons of Joe and Katherine Jackson burst onto the national musical scene in 1970 with a string of records that hit the top of the sales charts and forever ended the days when their father had to operate a crane in a Gary. Ind., steel mill. The original group consisted of Michael, Jackie, now 23, Tito, 22, Jermaine, 20, and Marlon, 19. Brother Randy, now 14, joined them on the concert circuit in 1973 and the three girls — Rebbie, 26, LaToya, 20, and Janet, 10 — followed in 1974. Only Jermaine will not be seen on the summer series. Michael says he was busy recording a solo album at the time they taped the shows. Father Joe, the primary musical influence on the talented children, also got involved, serving as an executive producer. But Mother Katherine. who played clarinet in high school, would have none of it, Michael reports. &quot;We couldn&#39;t push her up there,&quot; he said with a chuckle that indicated they really had tried. &quot;She just sits in the audience and claps.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Jet&quot; magazine (June 24, 1976)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Five plus one, minus one, plus three, equals...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Run that equation through your handy show business calculator and the readout is: The Jackson Family!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The equation breaks down thusly: the original Jackson Five—Michael, Marlon, Tito, Jackie and Jermaine—were joined by brother Randy, then lost Jermaine and finally picked up sisters LaToya, Maureen and Janet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The result is a sparkling entertainment package television viewers will receive when the Jacksons debut their comedy&mdash;variety series June 16 at 8 p.m., EDT, on CBS- TV.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As their summer mini-series proves, the Jacksons do it all. With such guest stars as Sonny Bono, Joey Bishop, Ed McMahon and MacKenzie Phillips, the Jacksons romp through comedy sketches and trade one-liners at top speed. There are running gags throughout the series, which tie together the four half-hour shows. (Introducing the first show, Michael quips, &quot;We&rsquo;re not the Osmonds, folks. Do not adjust the color on your sets!&quot;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Best of all, they sing and dance up a storm. They sing their golden hits and some new ones as well. Their footwork is flashy in routines that range from tap to the latest disco dances.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A highlight of each show is the &quot;Fonz-Off&quot;, a contest to determine the best imitation of &quot;Fonzie&quot;, the popular character in the Happy Days TV show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe Jackson, father of the group, and manager Richard Arens are executive producers of the show. They oversee the production team of Bill Davis, Arnie Kogen, and Ray Jessel. Aiding Jackson on various projects with the Jackson Family was Steve Manning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We started talking about the show back in March&quot;, Jessel told JET. Jessel and Kogen had worked with the Jacksons on previous occasions and were familiar with the talents they had at their disposal. &quot;So we had some idea of how they function in areas beyond what they&#39;re known for—the record act&quot;, Jessel said. &quot;They&rsquo;re much more than that. That&#39;s why we were excited about doing this show, because we knew they had so much potential in a lot of other directions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They have a musical capacity to reach a very wide audience and, I think, that&#39;s what CBS was interested in. And that&rsquo;s what the Jackson Family is interested in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When you&rsquo;re on television, you reach out beyond the record buyers. You may sell two million records, but with television you reach 30 million people.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although this is the first TV exposure for the Jackson Family, the original J5 were no strangers to television. They appeared on many specials as guest stars, and even had their own special, &quot;Goin&#39; [Back] To Indiana,&quot; with Bill Cosby as a guest. More recently, viewers have seen them with Rich Little and Dinah Shore and on &quot;Soul Train&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Janet and Randy have stand-out spots in all the shows, doing hilarious take-offs on such show business teams as Captain and Tennille, Sonny and Cher, and Donny and Marie Osmond. With Ed McMahon as W. C. Fields, Janet struts her stuff as a miniature Mae West to the delight of the studio audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jessel describes Janet as &quot;in- credible! She&#39;s, what, 9 or 10? She&#39;s a superstar!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The young producer was also highly pleased with the other Jackson girls. In particular, he digs the way Maureen, LaToya and Janet perform on &quot;Save the Bones for Henry Jones&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What we have&quot;, he continued, &quot;is a show for everybody. It&#39;s not a soul show, it&#39;s not a rock show. It&#39;s a variety show, a very fast-paced variety show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Half-hour variety shows are a new form, and I think we&#39;ve solved that form. There&#39;s no room for fat. It&#39;s very lean and tight, with lots of music, laughs and entertainment&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With the mini-series all taped and ready to air, Joe Jackson is apparently concentrating on his next step... preparing for The Jacksons&#39; first release for Epic Records. (Their split from Motown Records was effective April 1.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those who have previewed the TV series agree that the Jackson Family has plenty more to show their fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ordinarily, one would have to enter an expensive nightclub to see the entire eight&mdash;member group in action, since the young ladies were not put on the concert trail. Also, as Jessel explained, &quot;Rebbie (Maureen) and LaToya are both very beautiful girls, very sexy girls. I&rsquo;ve been surprised at their acting; they&rsquo;ve done some tremendous things, and they are both very delightful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Maureen is kind of quiet, but you can see there&#39;s a whole lot going on behind the quiet. And little Janet—she&rsquo;s like Pearl Bailey. She&#39;s a little take&mdash;charge lady, and you just can&#39;t take your eyes off her. I can&#39;t tell you what a nice experience it&#39;s been working with them (the Jackson Family). They are very professional, very cooperative... very creative.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Right On!&rdquo; magazine (Summer 1976)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the first time in the history of television, a Black family has been given their own regular TV show and it&#39;s fitting that the first group to receive what&#39;s due is the Jackson family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The Jacksons are one family in the business which tried to make every venture a family affair so the TV setup is no exception. Strong family feelings are evident in every part of the show whether it&#39;s just a look exchanged between brothers and sisters or Michael simply slipping his arms around his baby sister, Janet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then there&#39;s the behind-the-scenes Jacksons without whom the show couldn&#39;t go on. Papa Joe Jackson and his brother, Lawrence, are there with the children ironing out executive duties and making sure the show runs smoothly. If you take a quick glance around the TV studio you&#39;ll see Mrs. Jackson sitting quietly and proudly in the audience. Some of the wives are there too, and the children, giving the moral support that is necessary to keep plugging away when rest and sleep are so tempting!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The professionalism of these young people can&#39;t be overlooked either. From the way they perform under those hot camera lights you&#39;d never guess that most of them haven&#39;t had TV experience before and it wasn&#39;t until the summer series that they had much chance to do that kind of work. And they&#39;re very exact about each minute detail. No matter how many times they might have rehearsed a number, if Michael or one of the other fellas isn&#39;t satisfied with the performance, it is redone until it meets everyone&#39;s approval—and without a complaint!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons themselves composed the opening titles tune.</span></p></body>
