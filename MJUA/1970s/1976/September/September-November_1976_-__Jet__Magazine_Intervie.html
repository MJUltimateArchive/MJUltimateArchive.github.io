		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jet&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that the interview took place during the &ldquo;upcoming second season&rdquo; at the &ldquo;Hollywood studio where the new show is being taped&rdquo;; the second season&rsquo;s filming started around August, and the range is estimated by the interview&rsquo;s publication date.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Jet&quot; magazine (December 2, 1976)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They&rsquo;re The Jacksons now, well matured beyond the bubble gum-rock &#39;n&#39; soul image that rocketed them to stardom. They did their thing so well in a CBS-TV summer mini series they&rsquo;ll hit the tube again soon in the network&rsquo;s upcoming second season.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The sons of Joe and Katherine Jackson&mdash;Jackie, Tito, Marlon, Michael and Randy&mdash;outgrew the &ldquo;cute kid&rdquo; stage of their development, the point at which many show business youngsters get bogged down. Today they are serious performers determined to reach even greater heights.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During a JET visit to the Hollywood studio where the new show is being taped, each one of the fellows was full of talk about the morning&rsquo;s work, the progress of their fast-rising single, &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;, and their hopes for their forthcoming album for Epic titled (what else?) &quot;The Jacksons&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We worked with Gamble and Huff. They&rsquo;re great&quot;, volunteered Michael, referring to Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff&quot;, creators of the &quot;Philadelphia Sound&quot;. He modestly mentioned that he had written the tune, &quot;Blues Away&quot;, and collaborated with Tito to pen &quot;Style of Life&quot; on the new album. The two brothers also produced those songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito eagerly expounded on their idea for more original songs and deeper involvement with the production end of the recording industry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Interestingly, in the absence of Jackie, the eldest, who could not make the meeting, it was Marlon, the second oldest, who took over as spokesman. He took a seat behind the big desk in the producer&rsquo;s office and bemusedly announced, &quot;I&rsquo;ll go first. Then Tito, then Michael, and then Randy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The professional attitude of the Jackson brothers contrasted sharply with the juvenile jiggling for position that sometimes occurred at press conferences during the early days of the J-5. What happened?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Responsibility, that&rsquo;s what did it,&rdquo; explained Marlon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Even Randy, the &ldquo;baby&rdquo; brother, has acquired an adolescent aggressiveness that makes the older fellows hesitant about teasing him like they used to. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d better not. I&rsquo;ll hand out a few blibs&rdquo;, Randy growled, shaking a fist to illustrate what he meant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons&#39; TV Show will be much like their previous outing, and is produced by Bill Davis, who also directs with Bonnie Burns and Jim Mulligan as associates. Joe Jackson is executive producer. CBS has not yet announced a tar- get date for the show&#39;s premiere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jacksonettes&quot; To Debut Tito said he was especially pleased by how he and his brothers have been able to contribute ideas and suggestions for the show. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than just being there and having people tell you what to do&rdquo;, he began. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to know you can be creative.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito also revealed that future concert appearances will provide new visual treats for their audiences. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on different effects that will make the shows new and exciting,&rdquo; he explained.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And we want to go back to Europe,&rdquo; Michael added. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want our overseas fans to think we&#39;ve forgotten them&rdquo;&mdash;especially in London.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later, during the lunchtime break, two Jackson sisters, Maureen and LaToya, arrived. They revealed a new project that had both the beautiful, talented young ladies excited.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to cut a record,&rdquo; LaToya revealed, &ldquo;just the three girls... Renie (Maureen), Janet and I. We can&rsquo;t call ourselves the Jackson Sisters&mdash;there&rsquo;s already a group by that name&mdash;so we&rsquo;re the Jacksonettes.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mention of the &ldquo;littlest&rdquo; Jackson, whose singing, dancing and on-target impersonations of Mae West, Cher, Diana Ross, et al., are highlights of the Jackson family performances, led to the obvious questions: Where was Janet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She&rsquo;s at home... with the chicken pox,&rdquo; sighed LaToya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fortunately, Janet&rsquo;s attack of a common childhood ailment will not disrupt the family&rsquo;s working schedule.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A smile of quiet satisfaction at the way things are going crosses the face of Joe Jackson, whose lovely wife Katherine keeps the family&rsquo;s tummies filled with her fine cooking. The Jackson family act is the realization of a dream he envisioned back in Gary, Ind. In those days he worked in the steel mills by day and gigged with a musical group called the Falcons by night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, he sits in his office high above the center of Hollywood near Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street directing the diverse activities of his entertainment clan. He is obviously enjoying the freedom and the responsibility he did not have under previous contractual arrangements.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Epic Records has been wonderful to us,&rdquo; Jackson told JET. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re really promoting the boys, and that&#39;s the name of the game&mdash;promotion.&rdquo; Jackson emphasized that there are now three entities under his wing, the Jacksons, comprising the five brothers, who record for Epic and will play concert tours; the Jacksonettes, the three girls separately; and the Jackson Family, all eight youngsters together for showroom dates, such as the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. He has high hopes for the TV show, pointing out, &ldquo;With them (his sons) being able to help make it a good show by making suggestions for the comedy, dancing and songs, if the ideas are good, that&rsquo;s great. If they&rsquo;re not, that&rsquo;s okay too. Now I know some people might say, &#39;What do those kids know about putting together a television show?&#39;, but they&rsquo;ve been on lots of TV shows, they observe and they see what people like and they know what it takes to make a good show. And this will be a good show everybody can enjoy&quot;, he reasoned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A flicker of sadness crossed his face. &quot;Jermaine...&rdquo;, he said softly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d still like to have him with us. We&rsquo;ve got a place for him, but&rdquo;, his voice trailed off. He was surrounded by other thoughts, thoughts unspoken but from the determined angle of his jaw, it seemed clear that whether or not the &ldquo;prodigal son&rdquo; returned the Jacksons, who remained in the Motown Records stable, will keep on stepping.</span></p></body>
