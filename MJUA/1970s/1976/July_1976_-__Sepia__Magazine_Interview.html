Sure, we thank Motown for the things they did for us. But then we hope they appreciate the things we did for them, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Jermaine stayed on at Motown to pursue a solo career, he was still a regular visitor to the Jackson compound. The brothers all agreed that the day would come when he would return to the group, but until then they all wished him well with his career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were arguments sometimes, Michael admitted, that were part and parcel of any tightly knit family unit:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;All brothers have arguments. It wouldn&rsquo;t be normal if we didn&rsquo;t. But we always work things out. Our love for each other overrides any differences we could ever have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael enjoyed performing in Las Vegas:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quiet in the Vegas club. Then you really show what you can do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We knew before we ever made it big that image was important, and that we couldn&rsquo;t let the fans forget how important they are to us. I just don&rsquo;t see why so many people on top change their personalities. It&rsquo;s not our style.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With the family going in the direction they had wanted to since leaving Motown, Michael was keen on producing films.</span></p></body>
