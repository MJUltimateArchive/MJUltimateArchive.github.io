As I drove up to the huge steel gate blocking the massive driveway, I was greeted by the Jackson Family&rsquo;s lovely mother, Katherine Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs. Jackson informed me that Michael was waiting out by the pool (which is massive) for me to conduct this interview. As I walked up to the idol of millions of adolescent girls, he was feeding fresh roasted peanuts to one of the many birds in his collection; a particularly hungry Mexican parrot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was kind of difficult to believe that this Michael Jackson was the same power packed, full of energy, and enthusiastic entertainer that I had viewed recently on stage. One could even define the superstar&#39;s personality as introversive. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m on the stage, singing a song, I try to really put everything l have into it. Especially a beautiful ballad&rdquo;, says Michael as the colorful parrot wobbles up his arm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Would you consider yourself a bashful or shy individual? &ldquo;Well, I&lsquo;m basically a very quiet person at home. I really prefer to live a nice easy going life. I&#39;m not one for a lot of hustling and bustling. Really I care more about a small dinner party, where there is not a lot of people packed in one room, smoking and drinking. I don&#39;t really like the typical huge glamour-style party. But you know one thing, here in California, people naturally seem to be more relaxed than folks in other parts of the country.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has been performing along with his brothers now for over twelve years (seven of them professionally) and relishes his early years when the Jackson Family resided in Gary, Indiana. &ldquo;l can remember the very first talent show that we won back in Gary. l believe l was around five or six years old. l recall watching Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine really practicing hard on their vocal and music talents before l joined the group along with Marlon. The days that I spent in Gary doing talent shows are extremely important to me and will always be&quot;, said Mike.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Apparently the struggle for stardom while in Gary has made a lasting and beneficial impression on the mind of Michael when he says, &quot;Quite often when I&#39;m traveling by jet to a concert, I think back to the days when my brothers and me would have to ride in our Volkswagen bus for hours to do a show all the way to the East Coast with our father. Man, those were rough days, but I must say it&#39;s made me appreciate life better. The things I have now and experienced I am grateful for them. One should never take anything for granted.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the past year and a half the media has constantly touched on and at times ripped up The Jacksons&rsquo; departure from Motown Records; their recording company for seven years. Then The Jacksons exited and signed with Columbia&rsquo;s Epic label. Jermaine Jackson decided to remain at Motown and pursue a solo career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Discussing the group&rsquo;s decision not to renew another long-term contract with Motown, the lead singer of The Jacksons said quite candidly, &ldquo;I, as well as my brothers, learned a great deal from the folks over at Motown. We wanted to expand, to have the opportunity to pursue more areas with our talents. There are no hard feelings as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I still communicate with Diana Ross and Mr. Gordy (Motown head, Berry Gordy, Jr.) for example.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine and Michael have always been very close and tight knit brothers of the family; and this bond of brotherhood still exists when Mike says, &ldquo;Well both of us are real busy as you know, but we get together every time we can. Whether it&rsquo;s to go out someplace, horseback riding, to exchange videotape movies, or just to be able to see each other and talk. I love my brother as well as the other members of my family, but I do wish Jermaine was with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Hollywood, being known as the super haughty, high strung and egomaniacs, galore, town it has justly earned the reputation for, Michael Jackson in contrast remains, an earthly individual. &ldquo;I never have felt that people should feel that they are better than others, simply became they just happen to possess a larger share of material items and monetary wealth than others less fortunate. I believe in sharing, assisting, and just lending a helping hand to people&rdquo;, said Michael. Like most male superstars, Michael virtually has the power to command the affection of a countless number of beautiful young females the world over. &ldquo;A young lady&rsquo;s physical beauty can by no means outshine the inner-beauty that radiates from her inner heart and spirit. The kindness of a girl is more important than anything, really, to be honest about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson&rsquo;s search for inner beauty, kindness, and his general attitude of goodwill is directly related to his study of The Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses religion. &ldquo;Each day I take time out to study the Bible, no matter where I am. The teachings of the Bible have added a new dimension to my life. It somehow makes me whole.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whether Michael Jackson is traveling in the beautiful country of the Philippines or the busy streets of America, he is deeply touched by the poverty of the world, particularly the hunger of children. &ldquo;I love to travel and so far, I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to see a great deal of the world. In certain parts of the globe, I&rsquo;ve seen hungry children walking the streets with no shoes on. I&rsquo;m very concerned about the hungry children of the world and I hope I can do something positive to help alleviate this problem. Oh, before I forget, Steve, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to traveling to India one day. It&rsquo;s a long held desire for me to visit that country to see the Taj Mahal&rdquo;, says Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The summer of 1976 saw The Jacksons with their very own television series. Their four half-hour shows were widely acclaimed by industry critics and the public alike. The fast moving, television programs outscored the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bionic Woman </span><span class="csD5D7D290">in their highly competitive television ratings war. &ldquo;We really enjoyed doing the shows this past summer. I learned a lot about television production. I just found out today that the CBS-TV network decided to give us a regular show to be slotted into the 1972 schedule in January most likely. My little sister Janet was really amazing the way she came across on television.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Commenting on his favorite entertainers and musical interests, Michael says, &ldquo;I enjoy all types of music, disco to some classical material. It&rsquo;s difficult to say who are my favorite artists, but I do enjoy people like Fred Astaire, Diana Ross, Johnny Mathis, Stephanie Mills, and Paul Anka.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons recently combined their vocal talents with music geniuses Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff for their long awaited debut Epic Records album, entitled simply, &ldquo;The Jacksons&rdquo;. Their first single, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Enjoy Yourself</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, written by Gamble and Huff without a doubt will add yet another Golden Record to their already vast collection. &ldquo;All of us in The Jacksons have respected Gamble and Huff&rsquo;s musical talents for a long time and the combination of our efforts has been terrific. We are all looking forward with great anticipation to working with them again&rdquo;, commented Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The world can certainly use more people that have the characteristics of a Michael Jackson, an honest and true human being, and multi-talented. What is a legend? Michael Jackson (but you could never get him to admit it!)</span></p></body>
