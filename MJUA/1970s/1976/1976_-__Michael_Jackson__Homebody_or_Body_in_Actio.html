The quiet introspective one, and the other side of Michael that dances across TV screens and shows around the USA.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At home Michael loves to spend his time in the family games room and do a few lengths in the swimming pool. Michael also loves animals and takes care of Ricky the parrot and his sisters dog Mitzi.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I have all the time in the world for that,&rdquo; Michael said when asked about learning to drive as his eighteenth birthday approached.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to drive yet. And it isn&rsquo;t because I want to relax and have somebody else drive me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s favourite authors are Ernest Hemingway and Somerset Maugham. &ldquo;Short stories are so neat. They&rsquo;re something special, like a package. Reading one makes you want more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Due to his extreme shyness Michael said he didn&rsquo;t like crowds and didn&rsquo;t even attend his school graduation party.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be with a few people where we can talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke of his love for the stage and musicals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I love old musicals because of all the dancing and singing, the lights and action &ndash; that shows real talent. People get away with murder today. Entertainers used to have to sing and dance and act &ndash; today a lot of them just make noise, or copy what others do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael had an ambition to appear on Broadway, as well as appearing one day in films.</span></p></body>
