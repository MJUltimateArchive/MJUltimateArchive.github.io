Judging by your letters and I had several girls ask me what &ldquo;Lobo&rdquo;, the J5 mascot, was like. Well, he&rsquo;s a full grown Alsatian German Shepherd dog to give him his correct name, and he has the most delightful nature. However much you tease him, he never seems to get bad-tempered, although we don&rsquo;t risk going too far, like it would be a very brave guy who tried to take his food bowl away from him in a joke. Lobo isn&rsquo;t a sable alsatian like most of them. In fact, he&rsquo;s at least 3/4 jet black with just touches of sable color around the eyes, on his cheeks, and down the front of his legs. He really is a very original animal to look at, quite the trendiest dog I&rsquo;ve ever laid eyes on. He seems to realize he&rsquo;s pretty cool and swanks around the place as though he&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s gift to female poodles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As you probably know, we&rsquo;re slap bang in the middle of our Stateside tour at the moment and I&rsquo;m writing the column this week in blistering heat. I mean we&rsquo;re used to it being hot but this is unbelievable. Some other news we&rsquo;re happy about is Jermaine&rsquo;s graduation to the Californian Institute of Art and he starts what will probably be a four-year course in the middle of September. Fortunately, we do the last date of our tour in Honolulu on September 2, so he&rsquo;ll have about a week&rsquo;s rest before he gets down to studies. He&rsquo;s pretty excited about the whole thing because the course isn&rsquo;t like ordinary school subjects. He&rsquo;ll be doing practical film-making and learning how to write and direct TV-shows, things like that. Sounds great, doesn&rsquo;t it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hope you like my latest album &ldquo;Music and Me&rdquo;. I was very pleased with it and I&#39;m very grateful to all the people who worked so hard on it. The singer really only plays a very small part in these things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lilly Poster wrote to ask if my latest single &ldquo;Morning Glow&rdquo; was in fact the &ldquo;B&rdquo; side of my latest Stateside release. Quite right, Lilly... but the Motown people in Britain thought that &ldquo;Morning Glow&rdquo; is more suitable for the English market and I think probably they were right. I guess that&#39;s all there is room for this week, but I&#39;ll look forward to another chat in the next issue. Keep smiling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Love,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Michael Jackson signature)</span></p></body>
