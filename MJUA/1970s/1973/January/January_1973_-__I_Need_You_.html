He just wanted TJ to re-sing one or two sentences and put more emotion in it. So TJ said that was a great idea but he wanted Michael to how him how to do it. So we all went to the studio where Michael was recording his own songs five minutes away from where we were. We gave him a call and he came. He helped TJ all the way through the recording of his part and he also got the idea for the voice inflexions in the end. The producer of the track then asked him if he would sing at the end of the song and Michael said &quot;of course.&quot; When Michael started singing, the producer started crying because it was a dream come true for him; to see Michael Jackson singing one of his songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Taj Jackson, Twitter (@tajjackson3) (January 3, 2012) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjjcommunity.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-120806.html"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191001221901/http://www.mjjcommunity.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-120806.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At first my brothers and I didn&#39;t want to record &quot;I Need You&#39;.
