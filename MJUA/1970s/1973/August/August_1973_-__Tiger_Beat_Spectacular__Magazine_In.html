At first appearing as though he didn&rsquo;t want to speak, as the editor began to walk away he suddenly rustled in his seat to say:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about lately &ndash; what is your business or mine? I mean, I was thinking, some of our fans know us better than we know ourselves! Interviewers ask questions and the answers are printed all over the world. I have no privacy&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael accepted that perhaps he would never have a private life, but he was concerned about the attention he would have to cope with when the day came when he would begin dating or raising his own family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t people in show business keep part of themselves private &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d want everyone to know everything about me. After a while, I&rsquo;d feel like running when I saw someone coming.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
