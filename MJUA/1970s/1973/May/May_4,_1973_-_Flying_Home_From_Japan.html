They could wander the hotel and gardens at will, take their time shopping and really talk to fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the flight home Tito had a surprise for his mother. They were flying home on the Friday of her birthday so Tito slipped out of the hotel early Friday morning and got some cakes. He slipped away at the airport, too, and made arrangements for serving the cakes with a stewardess.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The flight took off at 4:30 p.m. and right after dinner everyone sang her a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; 37,000 feet in the air. The flight arrived in Los Angeles at 9:30 a.m. but because of the International Dateline, it was Friday morning again so Mrs. Jackson celebrated the longest birthday of her life.</span></p></body>
