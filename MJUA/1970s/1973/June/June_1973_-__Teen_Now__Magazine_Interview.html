But this article suggested quite the opposite. In fact the family would like nothing more than to spend their vacation on a farm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Author Lorna Harris is asked to guess what type of vacation she would expect the family to enjoy. It wasn&rsquo;t spending it on the ski slopes and it wasn&rsquo;t on a beach. Neither was it camping. Michael gave her a clue.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You know how I love to draw and take photographs. Well, in this place, there is a greater variety of things to see and draw and photograph there, either in the woods or on a mountain or in the desert.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The rest of the brothers chipped in with clues from; apple trees, ponds, streams, home grown vegetables, freshly picked berries and sweet smelling hay. Harris finally guessed it was a farm with the Jacksons love of fresh food. Michael said why:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not just the fresh food and the fresh air. It&rsquo;s the whole scene &ndash; the once scene we&rsquo;ve never had time to spend at &ndash; with the variety of woods and fields and streams and ponds and trees and animals and whole feeling of being able to get along on your own.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
