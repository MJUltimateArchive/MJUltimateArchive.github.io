		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">New York City, New York (The Jackson 5 World Tour)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lisa Robinson, &ldquo;Disc&rdquo; magazine, &ldquo;Take Five&rdquo; article (August 4, 1973) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808112931/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/d3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It happens once a year now--The Jackson Five come to Madison Square Garden and perform for their New York fans. It&#39;s the closest thing to that old style Beatlemania, so much hysteria is created that you almost wonder how the whole event comes off as smoothly as it does.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well--it does, because there is a well-oiled, smooth operating machine behind every single step that these six boys take.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The scene at the Garden was just this huge, vast arena of young black faces... primed for their first look in a year at their boys. From 7:00 pm, all eyes were at that backstage door; waiting for over an hour, during the first act--The Commodores, one of those Motown get-it-on acts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Around 7:45 there was a bit of bustling backstage, as Motown PR Chief Bob Jones appeared and Reggie&#39;s usual laidback style seemed a bit more determined... and one could see limousines starting to pull up the ramps in the very recesses of the Garden&#39;s backstage area.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hearthrob</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And--there they were! But the fans couldn&#39;t see them of course; piling out of the big, black cars were Randy--in a yellow and chartreuse outfit, Michael--resplendent in his green and white costume with flared inserts on the trousers and sequins on the jacket. Marlon wore the same outfit in lavender and purple, Jackie&#39;s was red and peach-colored, and Jermaine--hearthrob Jermaine was wearing brown and beige.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The entourage moved slowly toward the dressing room, followed by a few groupies who managed to get backstage, bodyguards, photographers, a very few writers, and the inevitable hangers-on. Very few, with this group, for let there be no doubt--you don&#39;t hang around with the Jackson Five unless you&#39;ve got some business being there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For 15 minutes--while 18 thousand fans screamed outside in anticipation, the Jackson Five were assaulted in the dressing room. And I mean assaulted. Relatives of the concert promoters came up to the boys--&quot;Now, please sign this picture &#39;To Sara&#39;, that&#39;s &#39;S-A-R-A&#39;&quot;, and &quot;Michael, please sign that &#39;with best wishes to Darrell&#39;... that&#39;s Darrell with two l&#39;s&quot;, and so forth. Michael, Marlon, Jackie, Jermaine, and Tito posed with an entire family of fans who somehow managed to get into the dressing room. Papa Joe Jackson observed it all with unbelievable calm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What totally knocked me out was the way the boys responded to the attention. Of course, they must be used to it by now, and they are pros--but my goodness, it&#39;s still amazing to realize how smooth these teenage stars are.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Hey, I remember you from the house&quot;, Michael said to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Will you send me those Discs with my picture on the over? Where did you get that blouse, it&#39;s great!&quot;, he said, touching the glitter on my last year&#39;s black satin jacket from Bus Stop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Introverted</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I asked Michael how he liked being in New York: &quot;It&#39;s nice&quot;, he smiled, &quot;I really like it the best in the East--it&#39;s entertainment, all those movies and all.&quot; He seemed to be slightly more introverted than the last time we saw each other, his hair is a bit shorter, too; other than that--he&#39;s all Michael. All charm and incredible bottled up talent.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;New York&#39;s where you live, right?&quot;, he asked me. &quot;You like it?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Well--I&#39;ve lived here all my life, and it&#39;s noisy, and crazy, and dirty, but...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Yeah, you like it!&quot;, he laughed. I noticed Jermaine taking out his bass in the corner to start to strum a few notes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Okay, I&#39;m going to get this marriage business straightened out once and for all... &quot;Well, no... I&#39;m not exactly officially engaged&quot;, Jermaine smiled in response to my inevitable question about Hazel Gordy, Berry Gordy&#39;s daughter. &quot;Ssssssshh...&quot;, he laughed. &quot;I really can&#39;t say anything about that!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon still walked around the room not talking much, a bit moody. Jermaine told me that Tito was taking it a bit &quot;slow&quot;, about being a father any week now, Randy signed programme books, Jackie talked to a few of the young ladies in the dressing room, and then it was time for everyone to leave--with thanks all round for the photos and the hospitality.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But it still wasn&#39;t time for the band to get onstage. The build-up, suspense, and tension still had about 20 minutes to go to make it complete. A few adorable &nbsp;black teenage girls stood around the backstage area, speculating. &quot;You talk to them inside?&quot;, they asked &nbsp;me. &quot;Is Jermaine getting married?????&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Well...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;If he gets married, I&#39;ll bust his ass!!&quot;, one girl huffed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Out front the M.C. was telling the audience that last year the show had to be stopped because of the kids rushing the aisles, and so would this year&#39;s if it happened again. That merely served as a signal to start the screaming again... momentarily the band would emerge.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Screaming</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And sure enough--first the backup musicians ran out onstage to the monumental screaming... and slowly from the dressing room came Randy, surrounded by bodyguards, then Tito, Michael, Jermaine, Jackie, and Marlon. All in a line, waiting behind the curtain to go on, hidden from the fans in the huge arena, surrounded by policemen and bodyguards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They&#39;re very quiet, can they possibly be nervous after all this time? Tito catches my eye and grins at me, they&#39;re not nervous. &quot;Let&#39;s go fellas!&quot;, Tito shouts and they race out onstage to a roar that would have put the Romans to shame... and at 8:25, the show begins at last.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;re Gonna Have a Good Time&quot;, the Jackson Five standard opening song is barely heard for the shouts of &quot;MICHAEL!&quot;, &quot;MARLON!&quot;, &quot;JACKIE!&quot;, &quot;JERMAINE!&quot;, and so forth that fill the hall. Eighteen thousand people have had a full year to get their vocal chords in shape for this event and they are </span><span class="cs43C038A">letting go</span><span class="csD5D7D290">!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boys go into one song after another: &quot;Hallelujah Day&quot;--their most recent single, followed by &quot;Looking Through The Window&quot; and &quot;Ain&#39;t That Peculiar&quot; with Jermaine singing solo and the girls going wild. Their precision dancing is more precise than ever, the choreography has been worked on and they are now a combination of the funkiest Soul Train style and Las Vega revue ever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dancing</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon&#39;s dancing is incredible, so is Michael&#39;s. Randy&#39;s beating on the congas, singing along. Michael grabs the microphone and jumps all over the stage, running to the back to see those faces sitting behind the stage; he springs to life, all the energy comes out onstage and it&#39;s quite amazing to watch the development of a performer that you must know will be around entertaining people for as long as you&#39;re alive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The big surprise of the evening, for J-5 watcher, is the excitement that greets Marlon&#39;s foray into the solo field--he takes the mike and leaps out front for a few lines of a song on his own and the girls all freak out; he is very definitely the next brother to watch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The concert is like that--it&#39;s a different show than last year--new songs, it&#39;s tighter, there are still some ballads that the audience doesn&#39;t respond to quite so loudly as they do to the more familiar songs such as &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot;. But for those who have waited and managed to come and see them, it&#39;s a fulfilling experience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">These are their boys--the Jackson Five </span><span class="cs43C038A">belong</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> to the young black kids in this country, they&#39;re proud of them, and they&#39;re their stars, and they never let their fans down. They give the best of what they&#39;ve got and it lasts over an hour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To the strains of the theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;--with dry ice floating all around them onstage, the Jackson Five do a real chorus line kind of slick dance routine, and they&#39;re off.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Racing</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Oil is an understatement. They get off in exactly four seconds--racing through a &nbsp;line of guards and police who even have to pull a few girls off Jackie, and within seconds they&#39;re in the waiting limos with guards all round talking in walkie-talkies, &quot;They&#39;re leaving now, okay--hold it up... here they go...&quot; and the Jackson Five are speeding out of the building... Michael literally waving goodbye to me through the car window, and I&#39;m laughing because I haven&#39;t ever seen this kind of an exit before. The faces are still in the hall shouting for an encore... they&#39;ll have to wait until next year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Robin Katz, &quot;What the Summer Means to the Jacksons&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What does summer mean to you? Are the first things that come to your mind a day at the beach, ice cream cones to the sky, or going on that holiday you&#39;ve saved up for?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In America, summer means pretty much the same thing. But for music fans summer is the most special time of year. It means outdoor concerts that go on till all hours of the morning, car radios blasting as you fly through the countryside in a convertible, and staying out very late without having school to worry about the next day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the start of the holidays most of us plan nothing but three months of deliberate laziness, but one American family is packing up and planning three months of traveling. While we run down beaches, they get mobbed by fans and security people. As we just lie back and bask in the sun, they get subjected to hours and hours of interviews. And while we line up to enjoy being entertained at a concert, these gentlemen spend time getting ready to do the entertaining.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But would the Jackson family want it any other way?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No&quot;, exclaimed Michael. &quot;We wait all year to go across the States touring. It&#39;s the only real chance we get to take a good look at the people who&#39;ve kept us popular all year long. It&#39;s funny, but people are always asking us if we mind giving up our &#39;free time&#39; in the summer to go on the road, but we can&#39;t think of a better way to spend the summer than giving concerts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie, the oldest of the group, explained: &quot;It&#39;s the best time of year to do concerts, you know. Audiences are much happier because they aren&#39;t under the usual pressures, and we enjoy ourselves more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When we first started, like anyone else who&#39;s just beginning, we had to prove ourselves. My dad figured the best way for people to know about our group was to do as many concerts in as many places as possible. If you can imagine, we&#39;d rehearse for three or four hours every evening and on Fridays, as soon as school was over, we&#39;d pack into a van and travel, playing concerts each night, as spread out as we could get from our home area. We&#39;d get back on Sunday night exhausted and then have to be in school bright and early the next day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Summer was a relief for us. It meant we could pack into our van, travel and play concerts for a few weeks at a time without having to rush back right away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s funny, but since we&#39;ve become famous most fans don&#39;t think we go to school or anything, but it&#39;s not true. I mean I&#39;ve graduated from school, so has Tito, and Jermaine has just, too, but wherever we go, Marlon, Mike, and Randy have to be up early for three hours of tutoring a day or we can&#39;t do anything else. So, you see, we&#39;re used to touring in the summer and when you get down to it, it&#39;s easier for us as well.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The idea of summer touring brings a wide smile to Jermaine&#39;s face. &quot;I love playing concerts in the summer. It&#39;s hot, but the heat&#39;s off if you know what I mean&quot;, he grinned. &quot;We toured England in November and it was very cold and rainy. We travelled by bus, which we loved, but too often the beautiful British countryside got washed out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Because of the rapid changes in weather, all of us were pretty sick, and one night when the heater didn&#39;t work in our bus, it was almost disastrous. Luckily our tour party had two buses and we all just climbed aboard the second bus and kept going. But had we done the same thing in the summer we probably wouldn&#39;t have had to worry about colds and heat so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;In summer, everyone is a lot more relaxed and we don&#39;t mind waiting around in places for planes and things like that. Also, our fans don&#39;t have to bundle up, and a lot of them look great coming to concerts in their jeans and short skirts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;A lot of people say they feel sorry for us because we work through the summer, but they&#39;ve got it wrong&quot;, added Marlon. &quot;First and most important, we don&#39;t consider it &#39;work&#39;. We love what we&#39;re doing, and that automatically makes it fun. Also, now that we live in Los Angeles where it&#39;s pretty warm throughout the year, we don&#39;t miss out on the warm weather. We have a swimming pool and a basketball court and we get in our &#39;summer&#39; sports all year round. We sure didn&#39;t have that in Gary, Indiana.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Summer touring is like a vacation, and since we&#39;re playing in our own country, where we&#39;ve been very successful for four years now, we don&#39;t have to prove to people who we are&quot;, said Tito.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, what I mean is people already have a good idea of what we do and our responsibility to our audience is to do our show well. Like Jackie said, when we were in Gary, and just beginning we had to get people to even come to see us, nowadays we can&#39;t do enough shows!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No example of Tito&#39;s comments could be better found than in a place on the east coast affectionately known as New York City.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the center of all those skyscrapers and hot dog sellers is a huge oval auditorium called Madison Square Garden. It houses sporting events, conventions, the world heavyweight boxing championship, and concerts. The garden holds an incredible 20,000 people and 20,000 New Yorkers must be just about the loudest audience in the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons&#39; concert was announced for a few days on New York&#39;s hottest soul station WWRL and within 48 hours every seat in the place was gone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How did the Jacksons take to playing for 20,000 people?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Great&quot;, cried Mike, &quot;just like Liverpool. The kids didn&#39;t even need seats because from what we could see most them were standing through the concerts. That makes us feel fantastic inside. We love recording in the studios, but when you play in front of people, it makes everything inside of you come to life.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mike admits he doesn&#39;t know what else he&#39;d like to do if he wasn&#39;t a pop star. &quot;It&#39;s places like Madison Square Garden that don&#39;t let you get lazy. It&#39;s not easy keeping all those people hopping and dancing&quot;, he laughed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t care what I&#39;m doing as long as I&#39;m doing something&quot;, grinned Randy, the youngest addition to the group, &quot;travelling&#39;s fun, and if you&#39;re not in a bus or car you can always play cards, or just have a party. We have a good time wherever we go. Don&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons&#39; touring family is a lot bigger than the one they have in Los Angeles. Jermaine gave us the run down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Besides the six of us, there&#39;s always our dad, who most people call Papa Joe, and Tito&#39;s wife sometimes goes with us. There&#39;s John who takes care of all of our costumes. He&#39;s responsible for everything from our shoes up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We have a team of lighting and sound technicians. A few hours before each concert they go into the concert hall with our road managers and set up all the equipment. The idea is that we want to sound on stage as close as we can to our records.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Actually, if the worst came to worst, Tito, Jackie, my dad and I could always set up our equipment. We used to do it by ourselves in the old days. But there&#39;s a lot more of it now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There&#39;s Rose Fine, our tutor. She&#39;s great, and did you know she used to tutor Walt Disney&#39;s children? You should really talk to Rose, she&#39;s a celebrity herself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There&#39;s Reggie Wiggens, our road manager. He used to work with Diana Ross and The Supremes before he came to us, and we also travel with different people from Motown. Everyone becomes part of the family.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So, while you&#39;re packing away your notebooks and pens with a sigh of relief, you can think of the family who are packing up their suitcases. And while you store away your good clothing for the comfort of faded jeans, remember who&#39;s getting into their three-piece suits. But a summer without The J5 in tour would be like a beach with no sand. While America gets ready for their annual musical heat wave, British fans can start scanning the papers for a tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the meantime, keep your ears glued west. If their concert at Madison Square Garden is anything like last year&#39;s, you&#39;ll probably hear the crowds howling--all the way across the Atlantic.&quot;</span></p></body>
