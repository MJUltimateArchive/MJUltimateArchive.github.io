His appearance on the show was an achievement in itself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wouldn&#39;t it only seem natural for Michael and the other members of his famous singing family to start acting? After turning on audiences for several years with their showmanship, why not the screen now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael a &quot;Ham&quot; and Natural Actor!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Recently when I ran into Mike, we rapped about the movie business. He was playing around and imitated the main character from a bit black movie. I was extremely impressed at how someone so young could possess so much talent. I commented to him that he would make a really great actor. Being the modest little fella that he is, Michael was surprised and quite pleased at my comment. Michael&#39;s a natural little ham, and so acting would not seem to pose any problem for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After my comment, Michael told me, &quot;I would really like to get into acting eventually because it seems interesting and seems like a whole lot of fun. But right now I guess we&#39;ll have to stick to our music.&quot;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Katherine Jackson, mother, &ldquo;My Family, The Jacksons&rdquo; autobiography (1990)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">while Michael acted like your average kid in many ways, when I watched him sing &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; on the 1973 Academy Awards show I was once again reminded of the fact that, professionally speaking, he was savvy beyond his years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I can&rsquo;t imagine a more nerve-wracking situation in show business than performing on the Oscars show. Yet fourteen-year-old Michael appeared to be no more nervous singing &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; that night than he had been singing &ldquo;Climb Ev&rsquo;ry Mountain&rdquo; at Garnett Elementary School in the first grade.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Even the comment he made to me after the show -- &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; was fated to win the Oscar for Best Song -- smacked of a seasoned pro: &ldquo;Mother, did you notice that in his acceptance speech the writer of &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t thank me for singing the song and helped to make it a success? That he didn&rsquo;t even mention my name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mamadou Johnny Secka, Senegal promoter, Blues and Soul (March 12-25, 1974)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I met Mr. Joe Jackson and Michael at the Academy Awards in Hollywood.
