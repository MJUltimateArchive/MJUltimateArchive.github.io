Robinette now believes he must have been more nervous than she was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1973, she and her family went to Seattle, where she stayed in Seattle Children&#39;s Hospital - then The Children&#39;s Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Robinette received a bone marrow transplant, which at the time was an experimental surgery. She was one of the youngest to ever have the procedure. She went through chemotherapy, radiation and an ever-changing plethora of medications.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But worst of all, she was kept in isolation for three months.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She spoke to her sisters through walkie-talkies, and only her mother was allowed in the room. Doctors told the family they had done all they could do, but her condition just wasn&#39;t improving.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;After you go through all of that, you just get tired and want to go home; you kind of give up the fight,&quot; Robinette said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She listened to her favorite group, The Jackson 5, on a sterilized record player doctors allowed her to have.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On March 7, she received her first visitor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was sitting in my room looking out the window, ironically listening to &#39;Looking Through the Window&#39; by the Jackson 5, when I heard all the nurses going wild and carrying on,&quot; Robinette said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She looked through the plate glass that was her only connection to the busy hospital and saw The Jackson 5 standing there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They asked me which one I wanted to see, and I said I wanted to see Michael - he was the cute one,&quot; Robinette said, laughing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She described the teenage Jackson as obviously shy but incredibly kind and sincere. He gave her an autographed picture, held her hand and asked her how she was doing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It had been so long since I&#39;d touched someone not wearing gloves, and I saw hair instead of just a green cap with eyeballs peeking out,&quot; said Robinette.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After that visit, Robinette started getting better.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I would never say that he saved her life - that&#39;s crazy - but he gave her back a little of her will to live because she had lost it,&quot; said Trine Robinette, 49, Leslie&#39;s sister.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Leslie eventually did improve, and her family returned to their farm in Greeneville, Tenn., where she still lives with her parents.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Leslie was 17, she met Jackson again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...When Robinette left Seattle Children&#39;s Hospital three months after her first meeting with Jackson, doctors said she might live 10 years. Still struggling with her disease, she is less than 4 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds, but she is now 42 and lives an active life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like Jackson, she has a strong passion for animals. She is involved in North American Riding for the Handicapped Association and currently is training to become an instructor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve always felt that Michael and I were kind of kindred spirits, because we both grew up not being able to really go anywhere or do anything normal kids do,&quot; Robinette said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
