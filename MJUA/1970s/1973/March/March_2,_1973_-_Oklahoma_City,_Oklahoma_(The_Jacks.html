I was a faithful reader of fan mags back then, and one of them suggested the way to meet your favorite recording artist in your hometown was to go the local concert hall around noon the day of the show and try to catch them rehearsing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After dodging all kinds of facility personnel and, at one point, even scaling a glass wall, Minnie and I nervously found ourselves sitting front row center no less, gazing at a set of red drums sporting the now infamous &quot;J-5&quot; logo. Technicians and roadies were still busy assembling and testing musical equipment when the Jacksons casually strolled onto the platform. We couldn&#39;t believe it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A sound check can be a fan&#39;s delight, for there you can observe nuances usually reserved for insiders. Tito routinely strumming through a rendition of &quot;Hallelujah Day&quot; with a cigarette dangling from his mouth; Jackie and Marlon nearly colliding while rehearsing choreography for &quot;Looking Through the Windows&quot;, a shy Jermaine spotting strangers and strapping on his bass guitar over a bulky winter coat, a young Michael adjusting his microphone stand and cordially flirting with two of my blushing female classmates, who obviously found their want into this joint a lot easier than Minnie and I. We all eagerly took in the sights and sounds until the building manager threw us out. Despite the illusion of disorder at the sound check, the night&#39;s performance--not counting Randy&#39;s mike going out on him during a lead vocal--came off without a hitch.</span></p></body>
