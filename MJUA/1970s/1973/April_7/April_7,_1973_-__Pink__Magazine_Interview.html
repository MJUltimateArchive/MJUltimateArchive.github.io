		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Pink&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date of publication confirmed in Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (&ldquo;7th April, 1973&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael discusses the type of girl he&rsquo;d like to date in category order: Honesty, Adaptable, Good Personality, Non Jealous Type and Music Lover. Before he talks about his ideal girl, Michael does point out that he thought it would be unfair to have a girlfriend during this period in his life, as he preferred to be busy with his career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Honesty: Top of Michael&rsquo;s list was &ldquo;Honesty&rdquo; which he thought was the most important quality in a girl. He wasn&rsquo;t keen on girls playing tricks to gain attention or becoming hysterical around him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Like one girl I know used to call me up, and when I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;hello,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d giggle, then hang up. I knew all along who she was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Adaptable: Michael said his girl would have to be able to be flexible for the lifestyle he led. She should be able to enjoy running around to different events and in quieter times enjoy sitting by the fire and relaxing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Good Personality: Michael said there was more to a girl than a pretty face. It was important his girl was understanding, sweet and kind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really a freak on comics and cartoons, and I love sketching and making up different characters. I know this is unusual, so I wouldn&rsquo;t expect my girl to be really goony about all this stuff &ndash; but I sure would like her to understand my liking for it. It&rsquo;s a part of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Non Jealous Type: Trust would have to be an essential in any relationship Michael had. Because of the adoring female fans he had, who often ran and hugged him and sent love letters, his girl would have to understand the situation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Music Lover: With music being the most important part of his life, any relationship he had would also have to be compatible with him. He often played his hi-fi around the house and played instruments like the drums. He said he could also suddenly burst out in tune also.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And sometimes, I&rsquo;ll do on the spot performances &ndash; like when I&rsquo;d just be walking down the street with my girl, I might suddenly burst out with &lsquo;I Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You&rsquo;, Ray Charles style. And I&rsquo;d want my girl to laugh and take it all in good fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...This article was part of an 8 page tribute to Michael in Pink magazine which was read by teenage girls in the UK. Titled Music, Music, Music, the article is in two separate parts. The first part is based on a letter he as supposedly sent to thank Pink magazine for the booklet tribute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Highlights included:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael telling the readers about the day he received the news from the editors of Pink that they were going to do a booklet on him. After excitedly running around the family pool he showed his brothers the letter, and then felt embarrassed by it. All the brothers congratulated him then threw him in the pool.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The second part covers Michael answering if they have changed since becoming professional and all other subject matters about his career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael admits they have changed; living in Sunny California in a big house is the biggest change.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group rehearses every day:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We rehearse all the time. Every day we come home from school we get together and work things out with our music.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael knew the value of practice making father that had been instilled in him by his father. However, he did admit that at first all he wanted to do is go out and play with his friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael discussed the process of how they recorded:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You see, if I&rsquo;m singing a lead on a song, then I go in alone and just do my part &ndash; the instrumental part is recorded first. When I&rsquo;m done, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon &ndash; Randy, too, sometimes &ndash; come in and adds their voices to the record.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael confirms he and Jermaine are both writing songs, but hadn&rsquo;t recorded anything. Michael was not in a hurry to go solo all alone:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like solo work, I just like singing with my brothers.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
