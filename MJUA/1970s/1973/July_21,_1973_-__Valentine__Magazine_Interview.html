Well, I can tell you at this point in time it doesn&rsquo;t seem very likely. The full story started quite a few months ago when we all got done up in our tuxedos and frilly shirts for a special night out. On that occasion, Jackie met up with a 22-year-old charmer called Debraca Foxx. She&rsquo;s the daughter of Red Foxx, one of the stars in the American version of your &ldquo;Steptoe&rdquo; program - it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Sanford and Son&rdquo; out here in L.A. Debraca and Jackie get along just fine and they&rsquo;ve been seeing quite a lot of each other. She runs a record shop of her own and often pops into our home to let us know how the latest J5 releases are selling. As to those rumors, I think it&rsquo;s just a case of Jackie having found someone he likes to be with. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a serious thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[A fan, Patsy White] wrote to ask me what I do when I&rsquo;m feeling down in the dumps. Fortunately those moments don&rsquo;t come along too often, Patsy, but when they do, I really enjoy a trip to a cartoon theater on my own. Nothing like a string of cat and mouse &ldquo;funnies&rdquo; to put a smile back on your face, is there? As I say though, it&rsquo;s rare for me to be that down. I spend a lot of time joking and teasing with my family. For instance, a favorite prank of mine at the moment is looking up a really long word in the dictionary. You know, something with about 30 letters in it, and then what I do is get in a casual conversation with, say, my Pa. I let the chat go along smoothly and then suddenly let this gigantic word drop out of my mouth as though I know exactly what it means. It&rsquo;s great to watch your victim gasp with amazement. The real trick is not to giggle and give the game away. Try it sometime and remember to keep a serious face all the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The best letter of the week award goes to Joanne Beddon...who sent a card in to tell me about one of my most UNUSUAL fans to date. Evidently her pet budgie digs the J5 and can even sing &ldquo;Rockin&rsquo; Robin&rdquo;. You must send me a tape of it, Joanne: maybe I can get [the budgie] &nbsp;recording contract. At the same time, send us your full address because you left it off your postcard. Can&rsquo;t send you your prize otherwise, you see!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thanks for being with me, hope you&rsquo;ll all be here again next week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Love,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Michael Jackson Signature)</span></p></body>
