But, as each of brother&rsquo;s state in the article, success did have its drawbacks. Michael said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had to change school three times because fans just wouldn&rsquo;t leave us alone. Our parents have always insisted on us having a good education and it kept getting to the point where we just weren&rsquo;t able to concentrate on our studies anymore. And it isn&rsquo;t nice leaving friends behind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon missed his friends, too, while Jackie wasn&rsquo;t getting the private times he craved for and Tito missed the music they played in the early days. Jermaine though felt rather different. He missed his mother&rsquo;s homemade sweet pie. This was mainly due to the fact they spent a lot of time being fed at the many shows and functions they attended.</span></p></body>
