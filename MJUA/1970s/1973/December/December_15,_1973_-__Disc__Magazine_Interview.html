On the other end was a buoyant sounding Michael Jackson, who ended up having as many questions for Brinton as he received for the article.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson 5 was on a short break over Christmas as plans were being made for tours and TV Specials in 1974.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke about his new hobby Rock Collecting, which he had started while on tour in Australia.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I brought a lot of rocks, while we were over there. Although I can get them over here too from the rock stores. I&rsquo;ve got quite a lot of different kinds &ndash; opals and jade.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brinton discovers that while the Jackson 5 is on a break, they are individually spending time writing their own material. Michael and Jermaine have collaborated on two songs called, &lsquo;She Found A Way&rsquo; and &lsquo;Crack A Smile.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Plans were also taking shape for their next album called &lsquo;Get It Together&rsquo; which Michael described as being a departure for the group from pop influenced to a more funk edged sound.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael confirms he has a new solo album planned, as did elder brother Jackie, his first.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll probably be quite a few slow songs on my album. I really like a lot of the slower ones. They are usually my favourites on the records I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and his brothers were keen to visit the UK again in 1974, after there last tour had to be cancelled due to the David Cassidy concert tragedy. The brothers still kept in contact with their mail overseas, sending photos and autographs. Michael said many of the fans knew the family phone number and used to call constantly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;At one time we had this number which our fans could dial and we could speak to them, but so many were ringing that they jammed the lines all over the country. So we had to stop that &ndash; but they can still write.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
