Situated around a patio, the walls are splashed with bright colors and healthy plants adorn table tops.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This afternoon, one of the studios is occupied by The Jackson Five, hard at work on their next super album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine, one week shy of marriage, is in the soundbooth, laying down the lead vocal for a song called &quot;Window Shopping&quot;, while his brothers, ensconced within the producer&#39;s box, work out their all important counterpoint, singing along without benefit of microphone or tape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are quite a few takes as the producer works with Jermaine for emphasis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finally, Jackie pipes in with &quot;he was sharper before&quot; and the producer calls into the microphone &quot;one more for Jackie&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s perfect and the Jackson brothers descend into the recording booth to lay down the backup track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s a heady time for the Jacksons (although recently you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a time that wasn&#39;t); not only the wedding, but they are already preparing for their first tour of Nigeria.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...During a break, one by one they go out to the patio for a little fresh air and some conversation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whenever more than one Jackson brother is together at the same time they get into routines, trying to answer questions without cracking up with &quot;in&quot; jokes but rarely succeeding.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, for instance, did a soft shoe number while talking about his writing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I spend a lot of time with my songs&quot;, he says, sort of mastering the sly art of shyness. I want to make them perfect, really good.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Each time I write a song, I think to myself that this has to be a top ten record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I have more trouble with the lyrics than the music&quot;, he adds, &quot;so I write a lot with Jermaine.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With the unfailing precision of someone who has been turning out million selling records since he was 8 years old, Michael sums up the Midas touch by saying &quot;all you need for a hit record is the right kind of feeling.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just what that right kind of feeling is might be left uninterpreted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Their recent tour of New Zealand, Australia, and Japan left little doubt that they&#39;re superstars across the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;We watched our cartoon in Japan&quot;, they tell you, marveling at seeing their animated selves speak a foreign language so fluently.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But Australia was pretty old fashioned&quot;, they added. &quot;There weren&#39;t many color televisions.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Four years ago, the family built an 8 track recording studio in their backyard, just a stone&#39;s throw from the all important basketball court.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just recently they completed the finishing touches on a 24 track studio so that the musical family need never venture past their own doorsteps again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;re recording here at MoWest now, but in the future we plan to record almost everything at home.

They can really see you, but Michael gets scared.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 13-year-old superstar looks beguilingly shy and adds under his breath, &quot;I&#39;m not scared.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When asked why none of the three Jackson sisters ever became part of the singing group, there&#39;s a long pause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finally, Michael shrugs and said, &quot;they never wanted to be in the group. Besides, if we let Janet in the group, she&#39;d have eaten up all the [illegible].&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But at least one of the sisters will be following in her brothers&#39; footsteps. Seventeen-year-old La Toya Jackson is about to record a song especially written for her by Michael and Jermaine. Michael, additionally, is planning to produce the single.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I want to get into other things&quot;, he says dancing around. &quot;I just cut some tracks with Glen Campbell&quot; and undoubtedly the Motown film organization is looking out for the project that will put Michael across on the big screen as they have on records, in concerts and on television.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back in the recording studio, standing up under an enormous poster that reads &quot;Diana Ross is Billie Holiday&quot;, Jermaine is singing out what will certainly be another million selling single...</span></p></body>
