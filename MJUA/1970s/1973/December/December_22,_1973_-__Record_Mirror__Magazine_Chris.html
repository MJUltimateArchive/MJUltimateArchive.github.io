We&rsquo;ve been very lucky this year and I think that&rsquo;s about the best anybody could get for Christmas&hellip;good luck, and being very healthy. Presents are very good too, but being happy is much more important. We&rsquo;re sorry that we didn&rsquo;t make it to England this year. I hope you don&rsquo;t think that we&rsquo;ve forgotten you, because it&rsquo;s not like that at all. We had other things we had to do&hellip;and one of them was school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael continued by saying how they celebrated Christmas by having the family over and singing around the piano. Jermaine&rsquo;s girlfriend Hazel&rsquo;s family were invited this particular year, Berry Gordy was her father. There was also one more addition, Tito&rsquo;s new son Taj.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The brothers would also be visiting some local hospitals which was something Michael loved to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t usually see who&rsquo;s in our audiences, but when you go into a hospital ward you see everyone. It&rsquo;s the greatest feeling, you know. And you don&rsquo;t have to be in a group to go around cheering up less fortunate people at Christmas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Robin Katz, &ldquo;Record Mirror&rdquo; editor, &ldquo;Record Mirror&rdquo; (November 25, 1972) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZTUI2Nvop_MJ:www.mjtranslate.com/en/aboutmjs/1453&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=1&amp;vwsrc=0"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were several times on the tour when Jermaine and Michael, in particular, would team up to do some very funny things so that I would have something to write about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was one meal that I was eating, and Michael came up behind me very quietly and just said, &ldquo;How come whenever I see you, you always have something in your mouth?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I turned very red till I realised he was just pulling my leg.</span></p></body>
