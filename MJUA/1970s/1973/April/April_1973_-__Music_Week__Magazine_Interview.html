		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Music Week&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the facts that, at the time of the interview, &ldquo;EMI have rush released the new Jackson Five album &lsquo;Skywriter&rsquo; (released March 29, 1973) and Michael&#39;s new solo album &lsquo;Music and Me&rsquo; (released April 13, 1973) to coincide with the tour.&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Jermaine&rsquo;s new album&rdquo; had not yet been released (Released May 6, 1973)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Music Week&quot; Jackson 5 Special (April 1973)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...There is no doubt that The Jackson Five have worked really hard to get where they are and continue to do so to stay there. &quot;We used to rehearse all the time in Gary&quot;, says Michael. &quot;My father used to make us keep going and he put it in our minds that practice makes perfect.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael interview]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyone who has seen Michael Jackson perform will admit that he is not only one of the greatest performers around today, but is destined to become one of the greatest names in show business.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although he is still only 14, Michael already handles himself like a hardened professional who knows all the ins and outs of the name. And Michael does. He has been singing with his brothers since the age of four and since their rise to fame he has sung lead on nearly all of their songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As well as this he has done tremendously well as a solo performer. His favorite song is &quot;Ben&quot;, and not many readers would realize that his hit &quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot; is as old as Michael himself. It first entered the American charts in August 1958, when Michael was born.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Five minutes with Michael shows you that he already has all the proper attitudes and charm that fit a top flight show business personality. Michael has already had to change schools several times because his female classmates started chasing him and now attends a private school in Los Angeles. He likes swimming and tennis and is a keen painter. He has also recently begun songwriting but none of his work has been shown beyond the family yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The fact that Michael has recorded solo does not mean that he is about to leave the group, or anything like that. He is quick to point this out. &quot;It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with my becoming a single artist. It&#39;s just something that all of us want to do, covering the entire scene.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael loves to travel and stay in different hotels and has been looking forward to the Australian trip. He used to find stage work frightening at first, but is now very relaxed. Sometimes, when the fans become really enthusiastic, he doesn&#39;t want to leave the stage. EMI have rush released the new Jackson Five album &quot;Skywriter&quot; and Michael&#39;s new solo album &quot;Music and Me&quot; to coincide with the tour.</span></p></body>
