		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tokyo, Japan Arrival</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Soul&quot; Newspaper (June 25, 1973)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Japan has traditionally gone all out in acceptance of American music styles and artists over the past twenty years but nothing has ever reached the heights of the takeover soul music in general and The Jackson Five are in particular has made with Japanese youngsters. The first four-day Jackson Five journey to Japan was not only one of the most successful of any American performers ever to tour the Far East, it was also one of the most enriching and rewarding experiences for the Jackson family on any tour they have taken.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Japan is a serene country in both its physical appearance and in the nature of the people. There are bright lights and noisy traffic-riddled streets and bustling stores and business centers, of course, but most of the places where people live and get together socially are deliberately serene and peaceful, reflecting the feeling and pace of the Japanese people. For this reason, the Jacksons were better able to enjoy sightseeing and relaxing in Japan than they have in many of the other places they&#39;ve visited.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The youngsters, accompanied by both parents this time, were first greeted at the airport by a large assembly of admiring fans who loaded each of the fellas with dozens of roses which the group quickly learned was the typical way Japanese fans show their love. Flowers rained on the Jackson Five by the hundreds of dozens at every one of the five performances&hellip; The Japanese kept throwing rose by the hundreds, but they rarely ran up to the stage. For the first time in years the group could [illegible] and change clothes, receive guests and relax right after the show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;Most of their spare time was filled with sightseeing and shopping trips. Interpreters met the group the day they arrived and escorted them all over often working twelve and fourteen hour shifts (if you can call touring with America&#39;s number one singing group work).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The interpreters helped tremendously at interviews and in talking to fans. But for the most part, one-to-one encounters with Japanese youngsters required no language at all. A group of five girls followed Jackie almost everywhere, not only at the airport was any real contact made. They each gave him a bouquet of flowers and he gave each of them a kiss. They had trouble crying and laughing at the same time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sightseeing and shopping</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs. Jackson bought jewelry and clothes for her daughters and daughter-in-law. The guys bought [illegible] for themselves and friends at a Japanese department store.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group visited Buddhist Temples, art museums, tea gardens and parks, but they also had a time to check out a bowling alley and some garden walking. They even had a real traditional tea ceremony in a real Japanese garden. On the street they were frequently recognized by kids who asked for autographs and giggled a lot, but there was none of the pulling and clutching that they usually get. 150 Jackson Five Fan Club Members came to the hotel. The fan club president spent one day sightseeing and shopping with the family. He was treated more like a member of the troupe than an outsider.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meet Ambassador</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The family was presented to the United States Ambassador to Japan, Robert Ingersoll, [illegible] trade between Japan and the U.S. and business opportunities. They learned about the importance of of his job and he suggested where they could get the best bargains on their favorite items. He even called a camera store and made arrangements for them to get a discount on on some items. Since he is from Chicago and they are from Gary, they all found a common frame of reference.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On their shopping expeditions their varied interests cane to notice Tito, Michael, Randy, and Mr. Jackson really got into cameras, buying many lenses, filters, and other accessories as well. Jackie and Michael also bought watches and everyone went wild on cassette players and radios.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the hotel... Japanese radio played lots of soul music, but one really great surprise was tuning to the Far East Network and hearing Wolfman Jack and Roland Bynum direct from Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">School was held daily with their regular tutor, but one of the most educational parts of the trip was their first train ride at 150 miles an hour from Osaka to Tokyo where they really got a look at the Japanese countryside, including rice paddies and workers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">T.B.A. had a reception for the group which was attended by Sammy Davis, Jr., who was appearing at a hotel in Tokyo, and Mrs. Jackson accepted his invitation and saw Sammy&#39;s show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group learned a few words in Japanese and opened every show with a Japanese greeting. They also thanked their audiences in Japanese, which the fans just loved, it was a most courteous gesture on the part of the Jacksons in a country whose whole culture is based on courtesy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Surprise for Mom</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie and his mother visited a few discotheques which they found very modern and very beautiful. The reserved Japanese also know how to get down and party when it&#39;s appropriate, too. Soul music dominated the disco play.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Spec&rdquo; magazine (September 1973)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael had stars in his eyes the first night in Tokyo, when the J5 were honored at a reception by the Tokyo Music Festival, which had invited them to Japan. Randy and Michael were honored to participate in a tea ceremony at a tea house in a Hiroshima garden. The kimono-ed maiden served them green tea and a sweet white cake. Michael&#39;s comment about the tea: &quot;It doesn&#39;t have any sugar in it!&quot; It&#39;s time for a lesson in how to use chopsticks--and Marlon, Jermaine, and Michael seem to be getting the hang of it! That&#39;s Emiko Komuro, a translator who traveled with the group in Japan, helping out. Michael liked the Japanese fans in all sizes and shapes--but he especially found the babies cute! He also had a kiss for a loyal, slightly-older fan. And, for this Japanese friend who followed him all over Tokyo--a reward. Michael gave him his bracelet! How&#39;s that for international relations?</span></p></body>
