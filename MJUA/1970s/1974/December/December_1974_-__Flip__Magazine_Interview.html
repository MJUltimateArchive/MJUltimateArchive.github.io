Not Jackie as was naturally assumed because he was the older brother. The Jackson 5 was run on a democracy vote system, so anything that needed to be discussed seriously was put to the vote. Jackie said there was a tremendous amount of respect for each other and he was just part of the team that helped out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said that if there was a difference of opinion on anything then a compromise was reached:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We compromise. We learned how to do that. Of course when we were younger we weren&rsquo;t always able to do that. We all acted immaturely and tried to impose our will on each other. It was sort of silly but we all thought we&rsquo;d be more important if we played the boss. Now that we&rsquo;ve all gotten out of that hang up we get lots more done and have lots more fun doing it too.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
