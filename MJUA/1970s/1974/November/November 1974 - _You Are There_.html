Michael pointed out to Brown that he may not like that version, but being the true professional he delivered as requested. After the session Brown took both versions of &lsquo;You Are There&rsquo; home with him, and was astounded to discover that Michael&rsquo;s version was the better of the two. He phoned Michael to tell him he was right, of which the reply came back, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</span></p></body>
