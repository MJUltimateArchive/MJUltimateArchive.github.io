I already like the name of this many-sided megacity. When we came on landing, I have seen one of the most beautiful cities of the world from the window of the plane. On the road to hotel another shock waited for me: I have found out, that everybody around walk in bathing suits. It seemed that, these people really enjoyed their life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Hit Pop Magazine interview (Image 003) (translated)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five was in Brazil with total strength. Michael (15 years old), Tito (20), Jackie (22), Jermaine (19), Marlon (16) and Randy (11) led to the biggest onslaught on Brazilian stages. They came with an entourage of twenty people and brought more than six tons of apparatus. Their gigs in Sao Paulo (two), Rio (two) in Brasilia (one) were a cheap, as well as singing the group&#39;s successes, they showed an incredible rapport (acquired in five years of career), dancing and Moving with impressive agility and perfection. The image that remained and that the Jackson Five is a well regulated sound and entertainment machine, in the best style of the American musical spectacles. And as the index of professionalization of the group is very large, offstage boys are subject to strict rules of behavior. Always accompanied by his father and employer, Joe, and Miss Rose Fine, a lady who takes care of them during their travels (in addition to muscular bodyguards), the Jackson brothers, as far as possible, showed the greatest goodwill and sympathy. They were not filmed with the recording of a video tape for the TV Tupi of Sao Paulo, which was until dawn, because of technical problems, nor with the rush of the fans who wanted autographs, much less with the general disorganization that marked Their presentations in Brazil. HIT POP chatted with the boys, almost in hiding, trying to escape the stern vigil of Joe Jackson, who forbade his children to speak at will and say what they thought. Let&#39;s chat with J5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - How come you can face the tremendous bar of show business with this good mood?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE: Look, what saved us so far and be very close. We work with family, which avoids many problems and, besides, we have a lot of professional awareness and we take our work seriously.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - And the bids that all boys enjoy, like playing, dating, having sex with friends? Is there any time to do this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: We&#39;re not a kindergarten. We&#39;re a rock band. But even so, we are equal to everyone. Our house in Los Angeles lives full of friends and Randy loves to take a swim with the people of the neighborhood. Jermaine and I like to play basketball and to have sex in the studio. At home, everyone does what they like, and we like to keep inventing things ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - And at school, how and what&#39;s the bar? Are you behaved?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON - We&#39;re just like every boy our age is. We studied, we got good grades (almost always), we played soliloquies in the classroom and we enjoyed the teachers&#39; quarrels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - But does not the school get in the way of the group&#39;s career?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE: It disturbs us, but it&#39;s a necessary evil we like. We all wanted to attend a college, but it will be difficult to reconcile the group&#39;s commitments with the studies. But we will do our best to achieve this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - But how do you go to school if you&#39;re traveling most of the time? And the faults? Do not you have cricket?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RANDY: We have solved the problem: we have a teacher who always travels with us and all the lessons we lose during the trip.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - Voices, that already sang in the great capitals of the world, like and that they felt the transaction in Brazil?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TITO - Look, we&#39;ve traveled a lot, sang for very different audiences and lived a thousand experiences. Everything went very well here. We wanted to sing in Brazil and tried to show the best of the Jackson Five. The Brazilian public was too hot, danced and sang with us all the time. The group knows all our songs! We did not know that we were so tanned like that. It was crazy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - Did you guys have fun around here? What did you do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKIE - There was no time to do almost anything, but only the sea and the beaches in Rio were worth it. Sao Paulo also surprised us: it seems like New York, especially when we were driving in the night, downtown, and I saw all those bright people and all those people in the street ... When we spent a little time, we visited the Institute Butanta and did some shopping.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - Why did you refuse the five cars that KEP Producoes put in your voice?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: And that the bus is much cooler, because it takes everybody, and we&#39;re more comfortable. Give to make a sound and even rehearse, which is very important, because in these trips you can not waste time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - There are people who find the songs of voices square, sugared and without content. How do you define the sound of the Jackson Five?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MARLON - Anyone who saw the shows that we gave here is aware of things. If our sound was square, the mocada would not dance all the time and vibrate like that. We picked up the dust from the floor and proved that the Jackson Five is not a grimace. Our rock and heavy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">POP - What are the group&#39;s plans for the future?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JERMAINE - We want to become more and more united, to perfect our work and perhaps to increase the whole. All this to keep our audience that put us in the place of the Beatles. Their place is now ours. The proof is in the incredible amount of discs that we are selling.</span></p></body>
