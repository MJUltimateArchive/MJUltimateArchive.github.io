However, they only managed to get to the Othon Palace Hotel, where they are staying, around 6pm. According to his businessmen, Koski and Ellis, the delay was due to the existing bureaucracy in Viracopos and also the determination of the group&#39;s chief of security that imposes the musicians that go together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quite apart from Alice Cooper&#39;s press conference, many strangers to the press were present, everything went smoothly with the Jackson Five. The members of the group were tired and asked that questions be asked quickly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first question inevitably was about Brazil, and the answer, of course, was flattering. &quot;A true Mafia involves the phonographic world, with its most intense activities in the United States and Europe.&quot; When that question was formulated, the six elements of the Jackson Five looked at their father and businessman Joe Jackson, who simply replied that &quot;they do not answer that kind of question.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Drinking soft drinks, the guys in the set were answering the most difficult questions for the father. Two questions slightly embarrassed old, callous Joe Jackson. The first was about the inclusion of Randy, the younger brother of the group, at age 12. The reporter referred to the change of voice of Michael Jackson, which until here was the withdrawal of the group, which now needed another child to continue to be a commercial attraction. Joe Jackson, after a brief hesitation, said that &quot;Randy came in because he wanted to come in&quot;, which did not convince anyone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The other question was whether the fact that the parents accompany the group everywhere would be more of a commercial motivation to create a positive image for the whole. Joe once again scratched his head and said no, because he travels under the condition of an entrepreneur.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although they follow the soul-music line and sing for a certain type of audience. Jermaine Jackson said that they play soul and rock, and that their audience is of all ages. () That really happens with this group and that its audience is between 5 and 14 years old, according to Chris Welch. Melody Maker columnist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quite the difference between art and commerce, Michael Jackson was intruded on his father when he tried to respond. Joe said that everyone was satisfied with the productions that have been made so far, and that the solo albums of Michael and Jermaine do not represent a divergence of style, but new works put up for sale.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe Jackson revealed that the group had begun filming a movie overproduction next month.

Day 12 of this month, the five brothers de-sembarcam in Sao Paulo, with a team of eighteen people. The next day, at the Palacio das Convencones do Anhembi, give the first show in the city. Day 14 still in Sao Paulo, they sing in Pavilh&atilde;o de Exposicoes do Anhembi. Then they travel to Porto Alegre and sing at the International Gymnasium (Gigantinho), on the 17th. And the tour ends in Rio, with two tremendous concerts in Maracanazinho, on the 19th and 20th. Entrepreneur George Ellis, who invested 800,000 cruzeiros in the transaction, The Jackson Five, discovered in 69 by Diana Ross, and one of the most successful ensembles worldwide and their shows are very ouricados. And the boys of the group do not let for less. For this first trip through Brazil, they are promising a lot of heat: &quot;We will shake Brazil. You will love us more than you think.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Solano Ribeiro, Tupi TV show director, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/TzSR1Z7gKqs?t=49s"><span class="cs8567212B">TV report</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (translated)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was impressed by the group that arrived without a riot, who recorded and did not talk to anyone.</span></p></body>
