		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bras&iacute;lia, Brazil (The Jackson 5 World Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date confirmed on ticket (Image 001), newspaper advertisement (Image 002), and Orlando Souza&rsquo;s blog post</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Joseph Jackson, &ldquo;The Jacksons&rdquo;, 2004 autobiography in German (translated)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Brazil, it was possible to get on our following concert, only by the plane. We have already taken the places when I have looked out in a window and have noticed, that our equipment still stands on plane field. I have begun to worry, have called up the stewardess, have explained to her that we have a concert right after the arrival in Brazil, and have asked, why our things are not yet on the plane. She has answered, that they cannot take everything at once that the things that remained outside, will be taken by another plane that will land an hour later than us. It has a little calmed me, though I not so would like to depart without our equipment. But the plane has already started, and nothing could be changed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When we have come to the concert hall in Brazil, our equipment has not arrived yet. I have asked one of the armed security guards to find out when our cargo at last will arrive. He has executed this order and informed me, that a cargo still in the San-Paulo and it doesn&#39;t seem that it will arrive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since the hall in the meantime was filled with people, he has suggested removing us through a backdoor, in fact if people will notice, that we cannot perform, a chaos will begin. But during this moment someone has declared through loudspeakers that show will not take place. He better not speak.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In some seconds a chaos began . The audience raged. We have jumped out outside and when we were seen by the driver of the trip bus, he at once has started the motor. We have hardly had enough time to jump in the bus as from a hall the raging crowd has tumbled down. People crowded around of the bus, pushed it and threw everything that came to hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Fast, lie down and cover your head with hands!&quot; I shouted to the boys. Splinters of the broken glass have flown, and in some minutes all windows have been beaten out. The driver by a miracle managed to pass through the furious crowd and not to crush anybody, and eventually we have got out on the free road. But the angry viewers still pursued us for some time. Thank God, we have got out alive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next day in all newspapers it has been written, that Jacksons hardly have not caused a revolt in Brazil.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At last our equipment has arrived from the San-Paulo, but that the concert actually will take place, they believed only when we got out on stage. No matter what, there was a fantastic audience. They shouted loudly and clapped, and to security service had to watch all the time that no one would climb on stage. And certainly, girls fainted in packs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The fact that they threw stones at our bus, has been completely forgotten. I was very much proud of boys, they have shown an excellent show, despite what they had to go through. After the concert Brazilians treated us extremely politely and attentively. It once again shows, how great the force of music is. If our music has reached their hearts, they become our friends forever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We have spent lead here 2 days, then we again had to say goodbye. The huge crowd accompanied with us on road from hotel to the airport. Despite of some unpleasant circumstances, we had more of the good impressions of Brazil, and in the end everything was exact the same as in other countries where Jacksons came with performances: with each concert the number of our fans increased.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Orlando Souza, fan who attended the postponed concert, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://orlandosouza.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/o-dia-em-que-estive-com-michael-jackson-em-braslia-no-inesquecvel-show-no-ginsio-nilson-nelson-em-1974/"><span class="cs8567212B">blog post</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Forlandosouza.wordpress.com%2F2009%2F07%2F05%2Fo-dia-em-que-estive-com-michael-jackson-em-braslia-no-inesquecvel-show-no-ginsio-nilson-nelson-em-1974%2F&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url"><span class="cs8567212B">translated</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We left the N&uacute;cleo Bandeirante (DF) for the show of Jackson Five that had done a show on their tour through Brazil. On that day of the show, the Brasilia Bus Station received thousands of fans who left from there on foot to the [Gin&aacute;sio de Bras&iacute;lia], for reasons that we will never know, the crowd of people followed of the Road towards the Tower of TV of Brasilia and we decided to pass between Hotels in the Setor Hoteleiro Norte.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I do not remember if they were staying at the Eron Brasilia Hotel or at the Aracoara Hotel, as we passed through the hotels (in a different route from the crowd), at that time there were no viaducts linking W3 North to W3 south, as we walked we observed a cluster Of blacks the door of the Hotel with some birimbaus (we were told they had bought at the handicraft fair of the TV Tower), and this caught our attention, we then decided to get closer and to our fantastic surprise were the Jackson Five. As my sister and I studied English at the time, I do not remember if we spoke English in Cultura Inglesa or IBI (British Independent Institute), therefore we could speak.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We were well received by the group and I remember talking to Jermaine Jackson a lot, watching everyone settle their belongings on the bus that would take them to the venue, it was a fantastic experience that until recently, as I remember, my sister kept the autographs of everyone, I remember Michael Jackson, Randy and Jermaine very well, who gave us full attention because there was a lot of time for the show to start.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was undoubtedly a special show for us, since the group&#39;s visit to Brazil was an extraordinary event because of the great success they already had at that time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember that for lack of some equipment that stayed in Belo Horizonte and did not arrive in time in Brasilia the show was canceled, causing a great indignation to the presents that stoned the bus of the artists when the announcement of the cancellation and postponement for the other day, because the Jackson Five went to the Gym nonetheless to satisfy those present.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That show had a fantastic performance and I will never forget the moment of the percussion solo done by Randy, when the gym was almost down, Michael Jackson singing divinely together with his brothers was fantastic.</span></p></body>
