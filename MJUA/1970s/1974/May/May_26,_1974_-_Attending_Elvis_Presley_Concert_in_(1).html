That sort of intimate venue seated about 1,000 people and pulled in the likes of Frank Sinatra and Charlie Rich. At some point during our down-time, Jackie must have wandered off with Michael because they found themselves in one of those wide, service-type elevators. Apparently, they were standing around, watching their feet, when the elevator stopped. The doors opened and Elvis stepped in, slicked hair and sparkling white jumpsuit with high collar, a thick towel around his neck. He looked at Jackie and Michael. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re those Jackson boys?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They nodded, dumbstruck. You&rsquo;d think that once you&rsquo;d met the likes of Smokey Robinson, Sammy Davis Junior and Jackie Wilson, nothing could faze you, but the randomness of that shared elevator ride was the biggest unexpected thrill. Not that it lasted long. Seconds later, the doors opened again and Elvis was on his way. &ldquo;Good luck, fellas!&rdquo; he said. That was the day Michael met the future father-in-law he would never know.</span></p></body>
