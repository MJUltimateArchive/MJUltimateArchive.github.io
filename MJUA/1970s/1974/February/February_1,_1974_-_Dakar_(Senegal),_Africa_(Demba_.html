		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dakar (Senegal), Africa (Demba Diop Stadium) (The Jackson 5 World Tour)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Blues and Soul (March 12-25, 1974)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just before the concert at the Demba Diop Stadium, the first of the three shows, we talked to several students sitting in the first row, waiting to see The Jackson Five. They were very vociferous about their anti-Senghor stand (president of Senegal), and strongly disapproved of his &quot;yes sir boss, yes sir boss&quot; ties with France. They were equally anti-Nixon for his lack of concern for African Liberation and the freedom of black people everywhere. They came down hard on French and U.S. imperialism, and called Presidents Senghor and Noxon a whole lot of &quot;muthafukkas&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In one interview, when asked if he liked The Jackson Five, one student said, &quot;I can say yes... But I like, because they are black men. But if they are &#39;yes Boss, yes, Boss&#39;... after the white man... every time after white man, I don&#39;t like. But if The Jackson Five are black, and proud to be black, I like it.&quot; It seemed that in each interview about the show, politics crept in and the youth used the opportunity to express their dissatisfaction with the way their country was being run and vowed openly that there would be a revolution.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When asked by Frankie Crocker what they were doing about it, they replied &quot;Revolution, Man!... everybody must do revolution here.&quot; When Marion questioned whether it was a &quot;revolution of the mouth&quot; they replied, &quot;No, no, no. We are not for revolution of the mouth... the revolution of violence.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The concert started slightly late, and The Jackson Five were the only group on the show. The show opened with an introduction by Secka and Frankie Crocker. (Mamadou translated for him). They set the stage and brought on the J5 amidst the wild cheers of the audience. They opened with the title tune from their &quot;Get it Together&quot; LP which somehow seemed appropriate G.I.T. was the theme, and the G.I.T. buttons were our delegations I.D. for the duration of our stay. THey became one of the most sought after items along with J5 photos and posters. Yes, &quot;Get It Together&quot; was a very appropriate message indeed, with all things being considered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The show was going well, when just after one of the explosion effects in one of the numbers, the smell of smoke, like that of an electrical fire was in the air. Smoke was engulfing the stage, much more than what was used for the effect, and the vocal mikes went dead. It seems that with all of the equipment and lights drawing on the transformers, one of them blew, causing a power failure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The rhythm was still loud and clear but after seeing that they were getting no juice for the vocal mikes. Marlon, Michael, and Jackie left the stage, as the rhythm continued, while repairs and/or replacements were made. When they returned to the stage, there was a thunderous applause and everything was clear sailing from then on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The audience, which had been relatively quiet until then, became alive and appreciative of what they almost missed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was a point where Michael, while singing, jumped off the stage into the camera pit, and walked to the audience. He took off his jacket, and threw it to the ground, and a mad scramble ensued for the &quot;souvenir&quot;. A tug of war followed for the item, but the winner was promoter Johnny Secka, beating all, in the &quot;battle of Michael&#39;s jacket&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The crowd was as much a J5 crowd as the teenagers in Gary, Indiana, or Los Angeles, California. They especially liked the rhythmic choreographed numbers like &quot;Daddy Was A Rolling Stone&quot;. Not at all like their daddy, Joe Jackson who was, as always, with them on the tour. Pop, who handles the business, is the brain behind the group and the single-most reason for their success.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs. Katherine Jackson (mother of the group), who was not on the trip (nor were the wives of Tito and Jermaine) recently reminisced about the days back in Gary... &quot;One of the reasons the boys picked up an interest in music is because Joe and I would not let them hang out in the streets too much. I remember when the boys won their first talent contest. Naturally I was kind of surprised when they were announced as first place winners.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Many times Joe would spend money needed for the house on microphones, guitars, or some other necessity for the group. Being an other, I used to be quite concerned about the way money was spent around the house. But needless to say, the investments for the instruments were necessary and it was beneficial because the boys practiced very hard and all those years of talent shows and small engagements paid off.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe Jackson was not without his own moment of glory, for he was honored by the Senegalese government with the highest medal of the country, Medal of the Lion, in a special ceremony in his honor. In the absence of President Senghor, who was in France, the medal was presented by Minister Fall, the Minister of Tourism, who is among the nicest and most efficient persons around. In turn, Michael presented the government with their latest gold record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By far, the most dramatic part of the trip was the visit to Goree Island, where the slave prison and houses still stand. Each year thousands of tourists take the ferryboat from Dakar to Goree. The waters are still inhabited by sharks some say, but near to the island many children swim out to meet the boat and dive for coins thrown from aboard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Many of the members of the entourage were visibly shaken, as the tour guide, the griot, told the history of Goree. He gave the Jackson Five, and some of us, pieces of the chains, now rusted, that held our forebears, men, women, and children, only a small percentage of which actually lived to reach the slave plantations of the South and West Indies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Black Stars&rdquo; (September 1974)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">About six months ago, The Jackson Five made their first concert appearance in Africa. It was in Dakar, Senegal and they were bubbling with anticipation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Japan, Australia, the capitals of Europe--they had appeared with staggering raves and adulation. But Africa was unknown, yet special; it was a sojourn of deeper meaning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five gave three soul-stirring performances in West Africa and when they were to leave for home, many friends many memories and many screaming fans would be left behind. The occasion of their maiden visit had all the jubilance of a homecoming--and that their experience had truly been.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As an added dimension of significance, the father of the Jackson brood, Joseph Jackson, was presented by the Sengalese government the highest medal of commendation the country bestows, having become the second American, following the late musical composer Duke Ellington, to receive such a laurel. The citation commended the senior Jackson for his &quot;great contribution to the arts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Also, the African visit of The Jackson Five helped launch the career of a Sengalese entertainment promoter, Mamadou Johnny Sekka. When Sekka successfully escorted the Jacksons to his country, he became among the first Africans to enter the league long dominated on the continent by European impresarios. For the 28-year-old promoter, the event was no less than a &quot;dream come true&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was a trip heavy with importance.</span></p></body>
