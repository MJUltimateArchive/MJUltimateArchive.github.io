A 24 track studio was just being fitted in their home studio at the time, but despite the fact they were not touring or recording they was still busy doing other things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke though of the advantages of being successful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get out of the gates much. All we need is right here. When we lived in another house we&rsquo;d go to a park and play a game of basketball.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But we have it all here, everything is here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael found it strange that people saw him as being different because he was a singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I live quite a normal life, and do all the other things kids do. I don&rsquo;t know why everyone thinks I&rsquo;m so different. I play basketball, swim, watch TV and even paint a little too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One point the brothers emphasised was the need for discipline and to make sure their homework was done. Michael was asked if his musical work got in the way of his homework schedule.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No! If it did, our dad would end our musical careers quickly. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than a stupid musician. People take advantage of you.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
