Instead of going along with the same formula that provided so many of their hits when they first charted in 1969, the brothers were now scouring songs they felt would push them in a new direction. This included not only material for the group but solo projects too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Now that almost all of us are looking for material for solo records as well, the songs have to go a lot further so it gets more difficult. I guess we could lower our standards and maybe still have big hits but why should we do that? We prefer to wait until the right song comes along and hope you&rsquo;ve been looking forward to it for so long that you&rsquo;ll go out to buy it and put it at number one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said he had improved a lot as a singer since the first hit records. Michael felt his voice had more range stating he could hold the top and bottom notes for a lot longer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael admitted to self doubt sometimes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well like every performer I have my moments of doubt, if something just won&rsquo;t go right in the studios I can&rsquo;t get to sleep for worrying about it. We all need reassuring that we&rsquo;ve got what it takes and I don&rsquo;t surprise I&rsquo;m any different from the rest in that direction.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What could people expect from him in 10 years time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;My voice still won&rsquo;t be at its peak, but it will be stronger than it is now and obviously I&rsquo;ll be in to different musical feel. Who knows what of thing but if ever I thought I&rsquo;d be writing songs that people respected as much as they respect Stevie Wonder, I&rsquo;ll be more than satisfied.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
