		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Las Vegas, Nevada (The Jackson 5 World Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">J. Randy Taraborrelli, biographer, &ldquo;Michael Jackson: The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the winter of 1974 during a family meeting, Joseph made the announcement, &lsquo;Boys, we&#39;re gonna play Las Vegas.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;But Vegas is the thing you do when you don&#39;t have hits,&rsquo; Jackie said, &lsquo;when you don&#39;t have a choice.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;The brothers thought hangin&#39; out in the hotels with white people would be no fun,&rsquo; Michael recalled later. &lsquo;But I wanted to play Las Vegas. To me, Las Vegas was part of show-business tradition. At that meeting, our father told us two things: first, he said he was trying to show the world that we were every bit as good as The Osmonds; then he told us about Sammy Davis and what he went through so that guys like us could play Las Vegas.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joseph explained to his sons that in 1945 when Sammy Davis, Jr., his father, Sammy, and his uncle, Will Mastin, were booked into the El Rancho Vegas hotel in Las Vegas for five hundred dollars a week. At the time, Las Vegas was the new show-business Mecca. However, even though the Davis act was invited to appear in the El Rancho showroom, they were not permitted to stay at that hotel because they were black. Rather, they had to check into a boarding house with the black porters and dishwashers who worked at the hotels. This was not unusual. Even a major star like Billy Eckstine, who was also working in Las Vegas at the same time, could not stay at the hotel at which he appeared. The showrooms and casinos were also off-limits to black patrons; blacks could entertain but not gamble or socialize with whites.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In years to come, Sammy Davis, Jr., would break through these barriers by virtue of his talent and persistence &ndash; and, also, a little help from Frank Sinatra, who used his influence to open certain doors for his pal, Sammy. Sammy went from being a member of the Will Mastin Trio to being a solo star, paid over $175,000 a week in Las Vegas. By using his celebrity power and refusing to take no for an answer, &lsquo;Mr Show Business&rsquo; was instrumental in de-segregating the town so that blacks could not only appear but also vacation and have fun there. By attending city hotel board meetings and working within the political system instead of against it, Davis also made it possible in the late fifties for more blacks to be hired at the Sands, where he performed. When Sammy died in May 1990, the Las Vegas strip went dark for ten minutes in his memory.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;I wanted more than anything to be a part of that great tradition,&rsquo; Michael said years later when recalling his first Las Vegas engagement. He had been a Sammy Davis admirer since the age of ten. &lsquo;To me, it was important. It was a giant step.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When it was finally confirmed that the Jackson 5 would open in Las Vegas in April at the MGM Grand, the newest and most prestigious hotel in the city, the Motown brass was unimpressed. &lsquo;If you decide to do this thing, you&#39;ll be doing it on your own,&rsquo; Ewart Abner told Joseph. &lsquo;Motown won&#39;t be involved. These kids aren&#39;t ready for Las Vegas.&rsquo; Later, Berry telephoned Joseph, personally, &lsquo;You&#39;re makin&#39; the biggest mistake of their career,&rsquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Butt out!&rsquo; was Joseph&#39;s response. &lsquo;These are my goddamn kids. Las Vegas has a good tradition, and I want them to know about it. It&#39;s time for them to grow.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Hey, man, that&#39;s my son-in-law&#39;s career, too. I&#39;m worried about him, about all of them.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joseph hung up on him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Certainly, Berry understood the value and prestige of a successful engagement in Las Vegas for any performer. After all, he was the one who had championed the Las Vegas breakthrough of The Supremes in 1966. However, that engagement occurred only after years of carefully honing the trio&#39;s act to sophistication. Berry wanted his Motown performers to appeal to adults, especially to white adults, but he was certain that the Jacksons would fail miserably because of their lack of experience with the kind of material necessary to please a middle-of-the-road, predominantly white audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Fine, then, let &#39;em go into Las Vegas if they want,&rsquo; Berry reasoned to one of his aides. He was still stung by Joseph&#39;s reaction to him; few people ever hung up on him. &lsquo;I&#39;m afraid that they&#39;ll fail there,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;but maybe it&#39;ll teach Joseph a lesson. Too bad the boys have to suffer on his account, especially Jermaine.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joseph was anxious to teach Berry a lesson of his own. At his urging, the entire family rallied together to prove Berry mistaken. &lsquo;We knew that Motown didn&#39;t believe in what we were doing,&rsquo; Jermaine recalled. &lsquo;My father was out to prove them wrong, and the brothers were behind him one hundred per cent. I was torn. I had a suspicion that Berry was right.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To make his family&#39;s show unique for Las Vegas, Joseph followed an example set by The Osmonds. That group had brought in younger brother, Jimmy, and sister, Marie, for their Caesars&#39; engagement, and to great acclaim. Not to be outdone, Joseph recruited LaToya, seventeen, as well as Randy, twelve, and Janet, seven. (Rebbie was also expected to perform. However, when she sprained her ankle, her debut with the act was postponed a few months, until June.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">None of the new additions to The Jackson 5 show was overwhelmingly talented, but their marginal ability did help gloss up the overall show. It was Katherine&#39;s idea to have Randy and Janet do impressions of Sonny and Cher, rhythm-and-blues stars Mickey and Sylvia, and even Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Janet also did a cute Mae West in a backless, pink satin gown and feather boa, which Variety would call &lsquo;hilarious&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LaToya joined the tap dancing routine to &lsquo;Forty-second Street&rsquo;. There was a bit of a problem with LaToya, though. She wanted to sing a solo in the act, but had limited vocal talent. &lsquo;She wanted the spotlight&rsquo; remembered a friend of hers. &lsquo;She would rant and rave, cry and throw fits. Joseph told her that all she would be allowed to do was mouth the words of songs on stage in group numbers, acting as if she were singing but not really singing at all. She didn&#39;t like that, but she had no choice.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On stage, the MGM Grand orchestra loomed large behind the Jackson family on opening night, 7 April 1974. It was the kind of oversized orchestra that could never fit on most stages. A small group of musicians &ndash; Motown&#39;s rhythm section &ndash; was added to the mix to help re-create the sound of the familiar Jackson 5 hit records. Bright and colourful firework patterns burst across a pale blue backdrop as the Jacksons appeared on stage, much to the excitement of their audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although The Jackson 5 had, for the most part, built their reputation on rhythmic music, for their Las Vegas show they showcased a variety of song styles, as typified by a centre-piece medley which they introduced on opening night. The presentation was different, for them. Instead of dancing, the brothers sat on tall stools side by side, with mikes in front of them. Their outfits could best be described as &lsquo;mariachi-band mod&rsquo;. The waist-length jackets worn over ruffled, white, open-neck shirts were reminiscent of those that draped strolling Mexican musicians, but the resemblance ended there. These costumes had sequin-scrolled lapels and were in untraditional colours: olive, green, pumpkin, pink, purple and gold. The bell-bottom trousers were light olive green, pale orange, maroon, lavender and brown. White patent shoes had clunky two-inch heels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The medley began with Tito strumming on guitar, he played his solo instead of singing it, followed by Michael with a fluid rendition of Roberta Flack&#39;s &lsquo;Killing Me Softly&rsquo;. On the last line, Michael turned to Jermaine, who sang a gentle version of Glen Campbell&#39;s &lsquo;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&rsquo;. Midway through that number, Michael and Jermaine harmonized the chorus. It seemed so effortless, their voices blending together to create a sound so natural, so right. They turned to Jackie. The music then segued into the classic, &lsquo;Danny Boy&rsquo;, an excellent choice for Jackie&#39;s falsetto voice. As Marlon joined in, the two sang as one. Though there was none of the vocal interplay shared by Michael and Jermaine a moment earlier; still, the two voices &ndash; sounding like one &ndash; created a full-bodied, clear-as-a-bell tone. The set ended with the three-song selections being interwoven &ndash; a line here, a line there, each one joining the other. It was obvious the brothers had devoted themselves to perfecting such an intricate, beautiful arrangement, one that did not just feature Michael. The audience could feel the closeness between them as brothers, much more than just fellow performers. The standing ovation was loud and long.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael had his turn in the spotlight, though, it was clear that he was the star. Spinning like a human top in his sparkling suit and flanked by his siblings, Michael churned effortlessly through each number &ndash; &lsquo;I Want You Back&rsquo;, &lsquo;ABC,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Love you Save&rsquo; and all the rest &ndash; changing pace again and again but always maintaining the mesmerizing grip on his audience so essential for a performer. &lsquo;When we started out, I used to be little, cute, and charming,&rsquo; Michael said in the act. &lsquo;Now I&#39;m big, cute and charming.&rsquo; After each song, he would walk to the footlights and accept the plaudits of his fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For their Las Vegas debut, the Jackson family had pulled out all the stops, coming together as a family for a stellar performance. As all of them joined hands and raised their arms triumphantly, the audience erupted into a standing ovation. Katherine was front and centre, leading the applause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the wings, stage right, Joseph rocked back and forth on his heels, hands jammed in his tux pockets, a grin spread across his face. With the exception of the absent Rebbie, this night was the realization of his greatest dream: all of his children on stage, performing together. &lsquo;They did it,&rsquo; he said to no one in particular. &lsquo;They did it.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Berry learned that The Jacksons had enjoyed a successful opening night in Las Vegas, he sent a contingent of Motown executives to the city in order to present an image of corporate solidarity behind the family. &lsquo;We were always certain that the boys had what it took,&rsquo; he then noted in a prepared statement sent to the press. &lsquo;This is just the tip of the iceberg where The Jacksons&#39; talent is concerned&hellip;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Backstage, after the fourth night&#39;s performance, Joseph read the press release article to his family. The family felt betrayed, except for Jermaine who had no comment to make about it. The triumph in Las Vegas was Joseph&#39;s to claim, not Berry&#39;s. After he finished reading the article, Joseph crumpled the newspaper in his hands and flung it into a trash can.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0coDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Jet&quot; magazine (August 1, 1974)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191023171806/https://books.google.com/books?id=0coDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was superb!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No doubt one of the best shows to come through Vegas this year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to see such a polished show by a bunch of kids. I&rsquo;m glad I came.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Never had this much fun at a show in years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;TI liked the two little ones the best. They&rsquo;re cute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Who are these Las Vegas critics praising? Believe it or not, it&rsquo;s the Jackson Five&mdash;correction: &ldquo;The Jackson Five Plus Three.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s true. Since their highly-acclaimed two-week engagement in the world&rsquo;s entertainment capital, Motown&rsquo;s prize group, the Jackson Five, no longer can be restricted to such references as &ldquo;the idol of the tennyboppers&rdquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;the princes of bubble gum music.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five (Jackie, 23; Tito, 20; Jermaine, 19; Marlon, 17, and Michael, 15) is now a dynamite package of family entertainment, designed to delight audience of all ages. And with the addition of three more younger talented family members (sisters LaToya, 18; Janet, 8, and Randy, 12), the group now numbers eight, and could very well be called the Jackson Five Revue.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Their versatility and ageless showmanship were proven when they opened their first revue at Vegas&rsquo; vast, elegant MGM Grand Hotel last April. Several critics and even the hotel management wondered just how the group was going to make itself as equally appealing to adult audiences as it is to millions of teenagers in this country, Africa, Japan, Australia and Europe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The solution was quite simple. Aside from doing their flashy footwork and performing the hit tunes that have made them phenomenally successful, including Dancing Machine (platinum status), ABC, I&#39;ll Be There and Never Can Say Goodbye, the group also enacts a &ldquo;Salute to Groups&rdquo; segment. This is a hilarious and happy harmony stint with the J-5 members performing the music of the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s, and includes their impersonating such diverse groups as the Supremes, the Andrews Sisters, the Four Freshmen and the Mills Brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The delicious revue is also spiced with humorous dialogs, jokes (even arguments over who&rsquo;s the leader of the J-5) and nostalgic dance routines with the group&rsquo;s attractive, shapely sister, LaToya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But without a doubt, the real showstopper is the musical comedy act of youngest brother, Randy, and cute, precocious Janet, the youngest sister, who stole the hearts of the hundreds who packed the club nightly with their sketch of musical television stars like Sonny and Cher and Mickey and Sylvia.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Such a delightful show prompted Hollywood Reporter critic Mark Tan to write: &ldquo;The Jackson Five is more than just another musical group; their Vegas bow with a Vegas-styled act and their own innate sense of showmanship, is entertainment for the entire family. Everything they do, they do with enthusiasm, joy and charm, and they do a little bit of everything! They are the new superstars of the 70s, and the blockbuster hit of the new year!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The audiences agreed wholeheartedly. The hotel management reported that the Jackson Five Revue was sold out during its final week at the MGM&rsquo;s spacious main show room. Bernie Rothkopf, the hotel&rsquo;s entertainment manager, said that &ldquo;thousands of Jacksonmania addicts were here to give the J-5 the hotel&rsquo;s biggest showroom attendance counts since the Grand opened last December.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Perhaps the person most elated and impressed by the stellar performance was Las Vegas Mayor Oran Gragson, who presented the traditional keys to the city to the Jackson Five onstage at the MGM. Said the mayor, &ldquo;&lsquo;I salute you stars of today and tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">About their newfound acceptance by adults, lead singer Michael told JET, &ldquo;&ldquo;Vegas is about the hardest club circuit to crack, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so glad that we were accepted there. If you can make it in Vegas, you can just about make it anywhere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The entertainer who preceded us at the MGM wasn&rsquo;t accepted too well, and he is a well-established singer, who has been in the business for years,&rdquo; Michael observed. &ldquo;But we had sold-out performances practically every night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie, the oldest brother (whose real name is Sigmund), said his family had unshaken confidence that their show would take the Vegas Strip by storm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have any doubts,&rdquo; he assured. &ldquo;The show was geared for that type of audience and it was destined to be a success. The novelty of it all, I guess, was that a youthful group was performing an adult show. We loved doing it, and we&rsquo;ve always wanted to bridge the generation gap and appeal to people from age six to 60.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The masterminds behind the scenes who put the Jackson Five Revue package together are Joseph Jackson, the father of the celebrated group; comedy writers Buz Kohan and Bill Angelos; composer Larry Cansler; choreographer Carl Joblonski, and designers Bob Sansom and Ruth West.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Regarding the new revue and his children&rsquo;s acclaim, Jackson (or Papa Joe) told JET, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very, very proud of all of them. We&rsquo;ve been blessed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;My wife (Katherine) and I have tried to rear them well and give them every opportunity to develop their talents. The kids worked for long hours every day during the first two weeks of April to prepare for that show. I guess this recent Vegas victory is the fruit of our and their labor. We&rsquo;re going to take the show to clubs in many of the major cities.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They deserve the best of everything,&rdquo; the proud father said of his famous youngsters, &lsquo;and they&rsquo;re getting it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mjphotoscollectors.com/index.php?app=blog&amp;module=display&amp;section=blog&amp;blogid=15&amp;showentry=54"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;16&rdquo; magazine (August 1974)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140809050223/http://www.mjphotoscollectors.com/index.php?app=blog&amp;module=display&amp;section=blog&amp;blogid=15&amp;showentry=54"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">FANTASTIC! OUTASITE! DYNAMITE! THE BLOCK_BUSTER HIT OF THE YEAR! And that&rsquo;s just some of what the dazed critics were saying after experiencing the Jackson 5 Revue as it took sophisticated Las Vegas by storm! It happened last April and for the Jackson 5, it was their Las Vegas debut &ndash; of course, they&rsquo;d played to more exotic audiences the world over (in Africa, Japan and Australia to name a few places!) but playing Las Vegas is somethin&rsquo; else again! It&rsquo;s the town where only the best and most-established entertainment is featured &ndash; often called &ldquo;Sin City,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s open 24-hours a day for dining, drinking, gambling, marrying, divorcing (or anything else you might want to do!), and people there are usually quite well-to-do and used to seeing dazzling nightclub shows! But no one-not one single Vegas-regular was quite ready for what the Jackson 5 were bringin&rsquo; &ndash; a combination of soul, funk, rock, comedy, fancy-footwork and incredible excitement! What was it like? Well, come along to the brand-new, ultr-glorious MGM Grand Hotel where your front-row table is reserved now!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LADIES AND GENTLEMEN - THE JACKSON FIVE!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As you step into the magical world of the main showroom, you behold a spacious, well-designed nightclub filled with people in their dressed-to-the-gills best, seated at small, round tables. Up towards the front of the showroom is your table &ndash; it&rsquo;s near enough to touch the large, lushly decorated stage! As you ease yourself into your seat, you look around and notice the audience &ndash; unlike at most J5 concerts &ndash; is made up of people of all ages (from six to sixty!) and colors! Everyone seems excited!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All at once the lights dim and a big, booming voice announces, &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen &ndash; The Jackson 5!&rdquo; In a split second, the stage fills with smoke-machine effects and you see flashes of orange, pink, purple, green and gold glitter dancing out of the smoke to the smashing sounds of Skywriter! The show has begun and you nearly faint at the dizzying spectacular that&rsquo;s taking place before your very eyes! Jermaine &ndash;his hair in Grecian curls &ndash; is wearing a sexy, olive-green jacket all aglow with sparkles on the lapels. Jackie is similarly dressed, but his colors are shocking pink and rose &ndash; Marlon&rsquo;s in sensuous purple, Tito&rsquo;s in flashy gold and Mike&rsquo;s a stunner in orange and gold! Little Randy looks suave-as-he-can-be in deep dark green! With a smile of sheer ecstasy on your lips, you clap and cheer along with the rest of the swept-off-its-feet-audience!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">THE JACKSON SIX?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the applause dies down, Tito steps up to the microphone and introduces the group (as if you didn&rsquo;t know them already!). He tells you that tho they&rsquo;re actually the Jackson Six, they can&rsquo;t change their name cos &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t really count Randy for a whole person!&rdquo; Everyone laughs &ndash; especially when li&rsquo;l Randy pipes up with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m small and even cuter than Michael &ndash; that&rsquo;s why he keeps me in the back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next, it&rsquo;s Mike&rsquo;s turn at center stage &ndash; he&rsquo;s so close now you can almost reach out and touch him! &ldquo;Since this is our first time in Las Vegas,&rdquo; he begins, &lsquo;we&rsquo;d like to do something very special &ndash; our own medley of musical history!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And with that, the J5 swing into their all-new and very different Las Vegas act &ndash; first, a bit of barbershop quartet music (with Tito warning the &lsquo;barber&rsquo; &ndash; &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t do a natural, don&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo;) Then, the J5 go into memorable mimes of The Mills Brothers, The Four Freshmen, The Coasters &ndash; and ever girl groups like The Supremes and The Andrew Sisters! What a sight to see!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You&rsquo;re so knocked out by their superbad display of raw, new talent that you&rsquo;re caught completely off-guard as Marlon gets way down into his far-out and funky version of Poppa Was A Rollin&rsquo; Stone! Then, there are solos by each Jackson &ndash; Mike does a moving rendition of Ben and Killing Me Softly with Her Song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And now, for the biggest surprise of the show &ndash; the on-stage debut of the female members of the Jackson clan &ndash; LaToya and Janet Jackson! As Mike says their names, Toya and Janet dash up from out of the audience &ndash; they were seated right behind you! Toya looks super-smashing in her black, spaghetti-strap gown, and Janet&rsquo;s extra-adorable in her yellow crepe halter dress.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RANDY &amp; JANET</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the girls&rsquo; introduction, the J5 and Toya exit the stage to change costumes &ndash; leaving only Randy and Janet on stage. The two littlest Jacksons begin what was to be the funniest part of the evening &ndash; a &ldquo;play TV&rdquo; routine where they pretend to be Sonny &amp; Cher! Janet&rsquo;s in all her glory on stage &ndash; she really vamps it up just like a pro! It&rsquo;s hard to believe that this is the very same child who&rsquo;s known for being shy with strangers and who cries when her parents are out of eyeshot! At the end of the Sonny &amp; Cher act, someone from the audience hands Janet a toy &ldquo;Chastity&rdquo; doll and she and Randy go into a rousing chorus of I Got You Babe! One thing&rsquo;s for sure &ndash; talent in the Jackson family is certainly not limited to the male members!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TOYA TAP-DANCES!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Randy and Janet are ending their duet to roars of sheers from the audience, the J5 and Toya suddenly bound back on the stage &ndash; all in gleaming white jumpsuits over sheer black ruffled shirts, adorned with wide J5 belts &lsquo;round their waists! They all sing and tap-dance in perfect harmony &ndash; they are , in a word, magnificent! But it&rsquo;s getting toward the end of the show now and you&rsquo;re feeling just a bit down that it had to end &ndash; but wait, there&rsquo;s yet another surprise in store! The mayor of Las Vegas appears on stage from the wings &ndash; smiling, he stops the show in order to present the Jackson 5 with the keys to the city! Tha mayor welcomes them and says they add &ldquo;a new dimension in entertainment to Las Vegas!&rdquo; With a swell of pride in your throat, you realize that the J5 &ndash; once unknowns from Gary, Indiana &ndash; have come a long way, baby!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">THE GRAND FINALE &ndash; YOU JOIN THE SHOW!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And now, it&rsquo;s time for the grandest finale ever &ndash; in true J5-style &ndash; Mike steps out into the audience and urges everyone to come up on stage and join in the finale! When he gets to your table, he leans over, touches your hand ever so gently and looks into your now teary eyes. You follow him willingly onto the big stage and joyously dance right beside him as the show closes with Dancing Machine! It&rsquo;s the closest you&rsquo;ve ever been to heaven!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the J5 hit Vegas it&rsquo;s an event of a lifetime! You &ndash; who&rsquo;ve known and followed their careers and lives for the past five years, can see them growing, changing, getting sexier, funkier and better as time goes by. You leave the J5 and Las Vegas with a happy heart &ndash; cos you know they&rsquo;ll be around you for a long time to come!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rebbie Jackson, singer/performer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://nypost.com/2010/04/18/the-sister-who-mothered-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;New York Times&rdquo; (April 18, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426084010/http://nypost.com/2010/04/18/the-sister-who-mothered-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She first performed with her siblings in 1974 at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, singing &ldquo;Fever&rdquo;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rebbie recalls Michael bringing her the lyrics and the choreography before the show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I learned that song actually on the set.
