Did she look at you and say &quot;Mm-hm, you&#39;re going to be shocking pink. Michael&#39;s gonna be blue, Jermaine&#39;s gonna be darker blue, and yours [points at Marlon] a purple passion&quot;, huh? Who got all their hair pulled out in Europe?

I had on a tie, and they were choking me this way. I lost my shoe, and--</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Griffin: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;ll get the voice higher and higher.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Griffin: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, somewhere in England, there&#39;s a little lady walking around with handfuls of hair, right?
