Last time they were here they set the whole place ablaze with admiration for their style, talent, and professionalism. Even the heaviest of pop pundits were to be heard singing their praises...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No prizes for guessing we&#39;re talking about The Jackson Five--who ought by rights to be called at least The Jackson Six, if not Eight. Why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, they&#39;ve just embarked upon a highly successful cabaret career in the States, and on stage they not only have little brother Randy, but also sisters Latoya and Janet. So why haven&#39;t they rechristened the group the Jackson Six?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That sounds kind of silly&quot;, Jackie told me. &quot;Anyway, we wouldn&#39;t call it &#39;The Jackson Six&#39;--Randy&#39;s so small, it would have to be &#39;The Jackson Five and a Half&#39;!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;ve become known as &#39;The Jackson Five&#39;, and however many of us there were, I think we&#39;d stick to that name. In fact, on stage, there are a lot more, although we only have eight people in the family. We&#39;re backed by a 40 piece orchestra!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That is only for the cabaret shows though, we&#39;re not likely to get the Jackson 48 here, just six. This new found success started for the Jacksons at Easter. And as Michael said, they&#39;re all pretty happy about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We did a couple of weeks at a hotel in Las Vegas and broke all the attendance records. We didn&#39;t know what it would be like, but it was really nice and the audience was so different to the ones we usually get.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Or as Jackie had elaborated:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We could actually hear what we were singing!&quot; He went on to explain to me what changes had been made to the group&#39;s act for the cabaret circuit:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Because we&#39;ve got some older people in the audience, we have to do a few older songs as well as our hits. So we&#39;re doing things like the Coasters&#39; Yakety Yak and material from people like the Andrews Sisters, the Four Freshmen, and the Mills Brothers.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When they arrive in Britain next week we won&#39;t be treated to any of those &quot;golden oldies&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh no, we&#39;ll be doing only concerts. But the fans will notice a difference in the show. We do shorter versions of our hits and there is some new material in the show--tracks from our albums, like &#39;Get It Together&#39;&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We&#39;ll also have the opportunity of seeing the boys do &quot;Dancing Machine&quot;--their last number one single in the States, which is being released here (in those immortal words) to coincide with the tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was talking to the Jacksons courtesy of the wonders of transatlantic communication telecommunications--they were in Lake Tahoe doing another cabaret engagement.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But even across those thousands of miles you could hear that they were all excited to be coming back to Britain:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;ll be really nice--we&#39;ll be happy to see all our English fans again, and we hope to get out a bit more this time. We want to go sightseeing and buy some clothes.&quot; That was Michael&#39;s reaction.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I haven&#39;t bought any suits since the last time we were in Britain&quot;, said Jackie. &quot;They&#39;re so much nicer than the ones we can get in the States--and they fit much better too. So I&#39;ll &nbsp;be buying a few more suits and some other clothes too. We hope to go down to the Kings Road if we&#39;ve got the time.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito will be bringing his wife Dolores with him again, and he hopes to have a chance to take her round to see the sights this time. After all, on the last visit Tito and his brothers were almost confined to their hotel--by their fans who had gathered outside, and the Osmonds fans who&#39;d gathered to see their idols. They were staying in the same hotel!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Randy will also be with them, and instead of a guest appearance he now does the complete show with his brothers. So it&#39;ll be a whole family outing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons are hoping fervently that there&#39;ll be no recurrence of the recent crowd troubles at their concerts. They were very sad when I told them about the death of the Cassidy fan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;it&#39;s very unfortunate. We have had some trouble at our concerts, and girls often faint&quot;, said Tito. &quot;But if anything serious happened, then we&#39;d stop the show&quot;. Let&#39;s hope that won&#39;t be necessary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That was all they had time to tell me, although there was a lot more to say. You See, Michael had to get to school. But before they went they sent the message:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Send our love to all our fans, and tell them we&#39;ll see them real soon.&quot;</span></p></body>
