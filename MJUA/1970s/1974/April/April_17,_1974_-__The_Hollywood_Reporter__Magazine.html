He&#39;s an expert dancer, comic, singer, and showman, and very early in his career, gained a reputation for his ability to control an audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time he was twelve, Michael could handle any emergency or malfunction on stage. His winning smile and ready wit have calmed many a restless audience while waiting for a plug to be reconnected or for enthusiastic fans to return to their seats.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spends most of his time with Randy, &quot;Because I&#39;m his big brother&quot;, Mike relates, &quot;and because we have a lot in common.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael draws a lot, mostly cartoons, and spends a great deal of time watching cartoons on television. He keeps many pets—most of them crawl.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He is also perhaps one of the best dressed young men of his age group on stage, but off stage, his manner of dress is far more casual as well as more typical.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has experimented with many instruments, liking drums best, but he&#39;s developed no serious interest in any of them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His love of singing and his professions have led him to cut solo albums and several singles; all of which have sold over two million and have gained him many more fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is learning more about music academically; reading music, arranging and producing, but he is happiest doing what he still loves best—wowing audiences with his soaring voice and capable sense of stage timing.</span></p></body>
