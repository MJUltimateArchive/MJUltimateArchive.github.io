I could hear very many differences in style, choice of material, vocal delivery, instrumental background, and so forth--but I wanted to get down what the boys themselves thought was happening on these albums.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I wouldn&#39;t be doing songs like &#39;All The Things You Are&#39; and &#39;Too Young&#39; if I thought that I couldn&#39;t do them differently than they&#39;d been done before&quot;, Michael told me earnestly. &ldquo;I always try and do things funky--like &#39;Rockin Robin&#39;--that was somebody else&#39;s song and I did it and it was a big hit; I always try and do things differently--especially if it was somebody else&#39;s song first!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I wondered if some of the newer songs that Michael was singing, some of the more &quot;pop&quot; oriented ones, the older standards, were hard for him to do; every so often there would be just the slightest sound of strain in his voice... and I asked him about that. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do them it they were hard to do!&quot;, Michael exclaimed, laughing. He added, &ldquo;I don&#39;t think that my career is heading at all in any different direction than the group being together. It&rsquo;s just that my music is a little bit more dancey--Jermaine&#39;s is more relaxing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...[Jermaine]: &ldquo;Well mine is for the young ladies &ndash; it&rsquo;s slower and sexier. Michael likes a lot of that wild stuff &ndash; you know jumping around, acting crazy.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
