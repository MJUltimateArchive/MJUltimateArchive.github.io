(Editor&rsquo;s Note: This occurs after Carol Burnett says &ldquo;very good&rdquo; in response to the class successfully singing back her &ldquo;A-B-C&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The stage lights above us started swaying like crazy, and everybody in Studio 33 stopped breathing for a few seconds, until the jolt was over. I glanced at our audience, and no one had moved. I figured I should keep on going with the scene, and as the teacher I said, &quot;No visiting, no visiting! The earth just moved. See what can happen when you pay attention!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were no more jolts and we finished the number, none the worse for wear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons were very shy during rehearsals, so very, very shy. But when it came time to perform, they blew the roof off the studio! They were the sweetest kids in the world, and I couldn&#39;t wait to have them back with us. They graced our show with their fantastic talents three times. I&#39;m still sad that Michael thought he was unattractive. I thought he was beautiful.</span></p></body>
