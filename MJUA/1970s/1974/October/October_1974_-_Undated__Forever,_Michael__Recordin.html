Michael was still young at the time, fifteen or sixteen, and he was still performing with his brothers as The Jackson 5. Forever, Michael was only his fourth solo record, and Motown was still marketing him towards the same teenybopper audience he&rsquo;d had when he first came along. You could tell what 2 prodigious talent he was, but he wasn&#39;t yet &quot;the Michael Jackson&quot;. He was still a kid, very pleasant, friendly, and easy to work with, very personable and approachable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eddie: Neither Michael&#39;s album or The Jackson 5&#39;s did well, and that was wholly down to promotion. Motown no longer had a team that was capable of breaking records, or at least not like they used to. Barney Ales had left in 1972, and while the label would soon be bringing him back when The Jackson 5&#39;s &quot;Forever Came Today&quot; was released, they couldn&#39;t get the kind of airplay it needed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My brother was convinced that &quot;Forever Came Today&quot; was a smash record, and it took a lot out of him when it didn&#39;t do as well; in fact, Barney once said he&rsquo;d been talking with Elton John, who described that song as the biggest record that never made it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brian: I loved Michael. He was such a great little guy to work with, very shy, very modest. He was so into what we wanted to do, and Berry made sure we had complete control -- Meaning, we didn&#39;t have Michael&#39;s father, Joe, coming in saying this and that, which is what I heard sometimes happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That really impressed me because we didn&#39;t know what the dynamic would be any more. I think of the situation with Diana, when Edward wanted her to sing &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, and she threatened to go to Berry, but backed down because knew what his response would be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Would the same thing have happened when we went back? Berry was saying we had control, but there were other people involved and making decisions, because to them, the artist was the most important person. The artist had to be kept happy, otherwise they might leave and go to a different label and take all the hits with them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Berry told Michael from the start, &ldquo;Brian and Eddie are in control, so pay attention&quot;, and he did. He was so good to work with.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eddie: I think the funniest thing was, Michael was so in awe of us. He used to run and make us coffee all the time, and ask us questions about what we did with our free time, how we wrote all the old songs. He was overjoyed to be working with us and having songs written by us. He would come in to the studio and wait on me! Berry used to laugh at him about it. He&#39;d say, &ldquo;But Michael, you&#39;re the star&quot;, and Michael replied, &ldquo;Yeah, but Berry, he wrote the songs.&rdquo; That&#39;s the way he was; he was a super guy and he never lost that.</span></p></body>
