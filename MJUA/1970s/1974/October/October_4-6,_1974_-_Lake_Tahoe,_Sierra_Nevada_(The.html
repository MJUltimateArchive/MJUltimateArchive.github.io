		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lake Tahoe, Sierra Nevada (The Jackson 5 World Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date of interview confirmed in &ldquo;Ebony&rdquo; magazine (&ldquo;Lake Tahoe became home for The Jackson 5 for about a week this fall when they played the Tahoe Sahara Hotel&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Ebony&quot; magazine (December 1974)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...When the group exploded on the national scene five years ago, it was conceded they had both talent and charm, but many wondered what would happen when the voice of Michael, then the 12-year-old focal point of the groups, began to change and they all grew older, losing their child-like appeal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;All we had to do was drop the key a half-step or whole step&quot;, explained Marlon, who, now 18, is but a year older than Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not only do the voices still blend, but age and experience has brought them the polish of professionalism and lucrative dates in the highest-paying spas, notably Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe. Garbed in the splashes of orange, pink, blue, green, and beige onstage, the J5--as they are popularly called--move with incredible coordination and energy. Tito and Jermaine gun the guitars, Marlon and Jackie glide and twist while Michael makes all the moves and uses his driving tenor voice to lead the group in such hit tunes as &quot;Papa Was A Rollin&#39; Stone&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#39; Robin&quot;, and their Academy Award nominee, &quot;Ben&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Michael puts it jokingly onstage, &quot;When we started out, I used to be little, cute, and charming. Now I&#39;m big, cute, and charming.&quot; Indeed the gods have been kind. The cute kid grew up to be a handsome lad, reed-slim with all that fantastic coordination, and when he appears in the spotlight, fathers glance nervously at their young daughters in the audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Remarkably, for all their success and tender years as celebrities, the Jackson youngsters are surprisingly shy and well-mannered, and a strong feeling of family emanates from their private hours. The morning after the act had received a standing ovation on opening night at the Sahara Tahoe Hotel, kith and kin were gathered around the dining table in a guest house sitting on the edge of majestic Lake Tahoe. Friends were up from Los Angeles, and all were breakfasting on giant donuts, sausages, bacon, eggs, cereal, and fruit juice. Tito&#39;s wife, Delores, and son, Taj, were there, and some publicists and others filtered in and out. Conversation was soft and low. There was a discussion of the upcoming Muhammad Ali--George Foreman heavyweight title match (most favored Ali), the baseball playoffs, and some fishing some of the group would be doing later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the day progressed, Jackie and some friends settled down to watch a baseball game on TV, Marlon took over a nearby pool table and Michael and Latoya sat in at the piano. Jermaine, still in a dressing robe, decided to needed a map. Randy and Janet were scurrying from one activity to another while outside. Tito led a fishing expedition, sometimes deserting the pier to take a motor-powered runner raft out into deeper waters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(&quot;I guess he gets it from his father and uncle&quot;, wife Delores said as she watched 21-year-old Tito through a glass wall of the living room. &quot;They love the outdoors. Sometimes Tito gets up at four or five in the morning to go fishing. He finds it relaxing even if he doesn&#39;t catch anything.&quot;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later, there would be scrabble and gin games for some, and a tutoring session for Marlon, Latoya, Michael, Randy, and Janet. (The school-age youngsters most spend three hours in being tutored for every day they miss in school due to work.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Through it all was the warm hum and bubble of family activity, totally free of eruptions of sibling rivalries.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The family is close, very close&quot;, Mrs. Katherine Jackson explained later. She had shopped ealier in the day for a jacket for Michael, who came from their Los Angeles home ill-prepared for the crisp, wintry-like air of Northern Nevada, then she had played scrabble and talked with visitors. She moved through the family activity, seeming to blend in rather than hover over it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rearing a family of professional stage performers had been no different than rearing any other children, she felt. Back in Gary, she and Joe had worried about the kids as they heard of others dying in the violence-filled streets. For their own good, a tight rein was kept on the Jackson children. &quot;Joe was pretty strict&quot;, Mrs. Jackson says. &quot;I didn&#39;t have to be when he was&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The children never presented a discipline problem, from Mrs. Jackson&#39;s point of view. &quot;After you instill in the two oldest what they can and can&#39;t do, the others automatically follow&quot;, she reveals. In between work and school, she says, there has always been family recreational activity: fishing, camping, movies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;A family has to be close&quot;, Joe Jackson says. &quot;A father has to be close to his sons&quot;. As for fame and the family, Joe says of his boys: &quot;They never let it faze them in any way. They always stuck with the family. We also have a lot of good people around them: a tutor, accountants, public relations people, security--everybody is behind them. And Motown did a lot to produce the group well and promote them 100 percent. That&#39;s one thing I&#39;m grateful to Motown for. All this has made the group successful.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While Michael has been the star onstage, he is not a star at home. &quot;Michael likes to lay back. He&#39;s not the type who wants to be out front&quot;, his father says of the real Michael as opposed to the performer. &quot;He&#39;s real free-hearted. He&#39;ll go out of his way to help anybody.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While all members of the group work on their choreography and musical arrangements, it was Michael and his mother who worked with Janet on getting her ready for the act, and Latoya says that she and Michael want to do a segment &quot;where he&#39;s Fred Astaire and I&#39;m Ginger Rogers. He&#39;s really creative.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At 110 pounds, Michael is small for his 17 years. &quot;Everything I gain, I lose on stage&quot;, he says softly. &quot;But I don&#39;t have much appetite. He and others credit Randy with being the big eater--&quot;fruit, cold cuts, everything.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s been a rough life for Michael&quot;, observes Jackie, who, at 23, is the oldest of the original Jackson 5, &quot;he&#39;s always been around older people. Now he&#39;s just trying to have fun.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie is old enough to remember when &quot;there was nobody but our father behind us&quot;, as the group struggled for recognition. He also recalls the restrictions that star-sized recognition brought: having to be careful where you went for fun in order to avoid overly-friendly crowds or cranks. They have also had to work hard at their act, trying to improve, experimenting with new ideas. (The Jackson Five recently wrote and produced a single release, &quot;What&#39;s Your Game?&quot;, now a hit record, for MDLT Willis, a group of four singing sisters managed by Joe Jackson.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Jackie expresses the family philosophy: &quot;If you want to be at the top, you&#39;ve got to work hard at it.&quot;</span></p></body>
