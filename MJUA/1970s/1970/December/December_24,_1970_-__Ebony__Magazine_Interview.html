S.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of the many awards copped by the young vocal sensations from Gary, Ind., are five Platinum Records, indicating sales of more than two million each, and the coveted Hollywood (Calif.) NAACP Image Award presented them recently for being voted &ldquo;Singing Group of the Year.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Regardless of their sensational rise to fame. success has not spoiled the five brothers who now live in Hollywood. The first indication to JET that success would not spoil this singing group came last summer when The Jackson Five insisted that the group be allowed to pay the fare for underprivileged inner-city youngsters to attend the group&rsquo;s first record-breaking concerts in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to Jackie, the eldest Jackson brother. &ldquo;It&#39;s impossible to allow success to spoil us when all we get is a five dollar a week allowance for each of us.&rdquo; Michael, the youngest and lead singer of the group, smiles when he complains that he is fined a dollar of his allowance if he fails to do his household chores in the spare time he has between studying for school and rehearsals. &ldquo;That dollar fine sometimes wrecks my allowance,&rdquo; says Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How important is education to this successful group? Toriano, 16, told JET: &ldquo;We study very hard, just like we were not successful entertainers, because we know that whatever we are, we are going to be better if we have a good education.&rdquo; Jackie graduated from high school this year, and the other four brothers are enrolled in private schools in Beverly Hills, Calif.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boys attended public schools until school officials complained that their popularity was interfering with class schedules. When traveling on concert dates, The Jackson Five always has a social worker and a tutor along who supervise the boys&#39; studies and take them on educational field trips.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine, 15, is perhaps the most avid reader of the group. In addition to his books and required reading from school, Jermaine reads a variety of publications on current events and social change. &ldquo;One of my favorite publications is BLACK WORLD,&quot; Jermaine said, adding with a smile: &ldquo;But. of course, I read JET, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon, 13, is perhaps the quietest and most scholarly of the group. His four brothers often complain that Marlon has all the answers and takes great pride in his ability to remember almost everything he reads. Marlon says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be smart; I just want to know everything, and the only way to do that is to study.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At home the superstars are not treated as celebrities, nor do they expect to be, the parents point out. They are the sons of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Jackson, who make sure, they say, that their children are very much involved in growing up. Their boys&#39; pleasures are simple and their tastes reserved, Mr. and Mrs. Jackson revealed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;All these boys have chores,&quot; said their father. &ldquo;They have to clean their own rooms, wash dishes, mop and wax floors. We want them to be good boys and respect their elders just as they respect their mother and father.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Asked if the group had a special message for their &quot;Jet&quot; Soul Brothers Top 20 fans, The Jackson Five said simply: &ldquo;Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
