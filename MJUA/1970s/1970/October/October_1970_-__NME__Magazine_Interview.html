		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;NME&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that the article says it was &ldquo;just weeks ago that the Jackson Five flew to Detroit&rdquo;; The Detroit concert was October 17, 1970. This is assumed to be weeks ago while writing the article for November 7 publication.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;NME&quot; Magazine (November 7, 1970) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808114850/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/nme3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Outside their back window, the lights from the steel mill flashed as the molten metal poured into the waiting molds, while the incinerators belched out more black soot. It was snowing. The combination of soot and snow made the air a thick gray haze.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inside, things were not gray, but bright and happy as five youngsters joyfully sang along to the Temptations&#39; latest song blasting out from the radio. These are the thoughts that the Jackson Five&#39;s memories of their days growing up in Gary, Indiana. They are thankful for the music that took them out of the ghetto.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Music has always been a part of the Jackson family life. Their father, Joe Jackson, had been a guitar player in his youth and he often taught the boys songs on his guitar. The three older boys, Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine were constantly singing along with the Supremes or the Temptations whenever their songs came on the radio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But music then was merely a form of entertainment within the family. There was never a thought about music being a profession.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Jackie, the oldest, remembers: &quot;On our street in Gary--which was called Jackson Street, though it wasn&#39;t named after us--most of the kids were starting to get groups together. So we did the same thing. We had always sung along with the radio so we just took it a step further and started performing at our school&#39;s talent shows.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The trophy they won for their first talent show has a small place of honor in their new Beverly Hills Home. Just three years after their first public appearance in Gary, the family, consisting of Jackie, Toriano (Tito), Jermaine, Marlon, Michael, father Joe and mother Katherine, sisters Janet, LaToya and Maureen, youngest brother Randy and cousins Johnny Jackson and Ronnie Rancifer, now lives in a large house with big glass windows that look out on to tree-covered hills behind their Californian home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just around the corner are dirt trails made by Jackie and Tito, who love to ride their motorcycles in the soft earth. In the backyard is a basketball court where all the boys okay their favorite sport. In fact, if Jackie could have two professions, he&#39;d place professional basketball right after performing!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The [illegible] Jackson Five actually lead two lives. On stage, they are the essence of enthusiasm, soulfulness, and driving showmanship. The public often makes the mistake of expecting performers to be as flamboyant and wild offstage as they are on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In this case, it is a mistake. All the brothers are down-to-earth young men, very much involved in just growing up. Their pleasures are simple and their taste reserved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie, 19, though on the quiet side, is not as shy as his brother Tito, 16. When you first meet him, he warmly extends his hand in a welcoming handshake. It takes a little while, but the more time you spend talking with Jackie, the more he opens up. His relaxed and smiling face pulls you [illegible] quickly...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, at 13, is the group&#39;s lead singer, and choreographer. As you talk to him, it&#39;s all he can do to keep from dancing to the music being played in the background. He never keeps still! His favorite pastimes, outside of music, include &quot;swimming, playing basketball, [and] catching lizards...&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At home, the Jackson Five are not treated like stars. They rehearse after school three days a week and must have their homework done before there is any play.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;All the boys have chores&quot;, their father, Joe, told me. &quot;They have to clean their own rooms, wash dishes, mop and wax the floors. We want them to be good boys and to respect their mother and father.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They&#39;ve come a long way from their modest Gary home. All the youngsters admit their dreams are coming true. There was the dream of moving to California to love, and Jackie remembers: &quot;I used to sit and watch the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and I&#39;d say, &#39;You know, I&#39;d like to be up there.&#39; Now we&#39;ve been on his show twice and it&#39;s hard to explain just how we felt when we did it. I just know it was a great, great feeling!&quot;</span></p></body>
