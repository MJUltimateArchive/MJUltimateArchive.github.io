Its exclusion was a by-product of the 1970 show&rsquo;s technical difficulties &ndash; Jermaine&rsquo;s vocal mic was off, his bass amp was inaudible, and the show had to be stopped for several minutes while the sound crew scrambled to fix everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Imagine! Their big moment, ready for lift-off, the crowd ready to explode &ndash; and instead the Jackson 5 had to stand by. Their family was waiting in the audience; Motown execs were fuming; the crowd, after waiting through two opening acts, had begun to creep toward the stage. During the break the emcee, KJLH disc jockey Rick Holmes, encouraged calm while offering J5 trivia: Jackie had graduated high school the day before. The J5 then tried &ldquo;Stand!&rdquo; again, to no avail.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Loyal fans, today you can hear a brief representation of the first, fumbling &ldquo;Stand!,&rdquo; followed by the full reprise. Listen carefully to the fadeout: a helpful audience member pleads, &ldquo;Sing &lsquo;I Want You Back&rsquo;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Which the band did. But there were still some issues with Jermaine&rsquo;s amp; notice the difference in the bass sound between this and the 1972 show. MJ pointed out the remaining problem at the end of &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; &ndash; pretty bold for an 11-year-old, or an artist of any age, on his first major tour. It&rsquo;s fascinating that he didn&rsquo;t comment off-mic; he said &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with his amp?&rdquo; loud enough for the entire Forum to hear. And he didn&rsquo;t follow up with another question. He stated &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; with withering authority, befitting a full-grown man with years of onstage experience. Young Michael&rsquo;s months of watching the greats at Motown had provided him with a key truth: if you&rsquo;re going to do it, do it well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The James Brown influence hung heavy in the 1970 Forum show, mostly in the stage patter, some of which sounded appropriated from a couple of Brown live shows. The thread ran right through to &ldquo;There Was A Time,&rdquo; a JB jam spun out of his 1967 stage shows, which became best known in the recording from the Apollo Theater that year. The Jackson 5&rsquo;s cover was a fascinating, surprising choice, since by then the original single version of the track was already more than two years old and hardly a pop tune accessible to the screaming audience at the J5 shows.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;But it gave the guys a chance to dance some more, and little Mike was more than up to the task; the performance also pointed to the similarity between it and the &ldquo;shake it&rdquo; break in &ldquo;ABC.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;We&rsquo;d like to say, wow, they performed a tune live they hadn&rsquo;t yet recorded. A poke in the vault shows that Motown producers cut for the Jackson 5 a studio track of &ldquo;There Was A Time&rdquo; &ndash; but, sorry fans, it was never finished, there are no vocals and isn&rsquo;t really releasable.</span></p></body>
