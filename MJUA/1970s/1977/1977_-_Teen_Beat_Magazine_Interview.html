But I don&rsquo;t think I could be that way even if no one had been watching me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael mentioned why he still lived at home even though most of his brothers had got married and moved out:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I live at home with my mom and dad, and I&rsquo;m not really ready to live on my own.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael denied the rumour of Jermaine leaving because of a lawsuit:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Jermaine left because he wanted his own solo career. Jermaine comes over every day. He&rsquo;s still our brother. We&rsquo;re still a family, and what family means is staying together in the unity of love &ndash; that&rsquo;s the most important thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Away from the spotlight Michael loved the normal things in life:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I spend a lot of time by myself. That&rsquo;s the way I want it. I may take a walk. Or I may watch some video tapes. I read some I guess. I may just sit and do nothing. You don&rsquo;t always have to be doing something, you know. In many ways I&rsquo;m not that sophisticated. But that&rsquo;s no crime. You don&rsquo;t have to be all that hip and worldly to be a good person. I&rsquo;m just plain old me. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
