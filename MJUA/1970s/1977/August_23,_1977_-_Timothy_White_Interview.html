It got a lot of plays in discos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yes. It did very well. They released a single [Show You The Way To Go] from that album in London, and it did very well. Went to Number 1. It was Number 1 for like two weeks in a row. And now they released Dreamer from that album. It&rsquo;s one of my favourite ones from that album. It&rsquo;s a ballad n&rsquo; all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Goin&rsquo; Places is supposed to be the single from the new album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: So far, they&rsquo;ve chosen it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Who chooses it? You?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Kenny Gamble, the producer, and the President of Columbia [Walter Yetnikoff] .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Do you have any influence?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: We talk to the guys and everything, you know, and tell them. Because they know we know what&rsquo;s good, and we know what kids wanna to hear. We dance, and we&rsquo;re out there all the time while they&rsquo;re in their offices. [Grinning Impishly] So they know they better listen to what we say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Are you hot for dance singles these days?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yes. Both -- ballads and dance singles. I just love to see the kids have a good time when the music come on. Sometime I sneak into this skating rink when they put them jams on. And you can tell when something&rsquo;s dirty: the kids be kicking in. Soon as there&rsquo;s something hot -- ow! -- they break out. Which is important, because people like to dance and have a good time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Speaking of ballads, I think back to Ben. [Ben was written for the 1972 horror film Ben (the sequel to 1971&rsquo;s thriller about befriending rats, Willard) by composer Walter Scharf and lyricist Don Black. The recording session was co-produced by Freddie Perren, Fonce Mizell, Deke Edwards, and Berry Gordy, Jr. Michael Jackson had no credit role in creating the song.] Even though it was Number 1 in 1972, a lot of people don&rsquo;t know the song&rsquo;s about a rat. They haven&#39;t seen the film, so they see the song as a ballad about friendship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Umm hmm. I like it both ways.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: How do you mean?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I mainly like it as a record. I love rats. And I like it as a friend, too, as if I&rsquo;m talking to a guy that&rsquo;s a friend of mine -- [blushing smile] but none other than just a friend! Some people see it the friend way. It works both ways.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: You&rsquo;re big on rats?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I love them. I used to raise them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: White rats? You raised them at home?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah. In cages and things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: You&rsquo;ve gotten out of it now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Nodding] You know, &lsquo;cause rats have weird characteristics. [Very sheepish] They start eating one another. They really do. It just got sickening to me, and I just said forget it. I came one night and looked in the cage, and the rats had eaten each other. The father was eating the babies. I got sick of looking at it all and left their cage outside. I didn&rsquo;t realize how cold it was. The rats, still alive, frozen to death. [Laughs] I don&rsquo;t mind talking about it, if you don&rsquo;t. Do you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Plus, in Beverly Hills there&rsquo;s a lot of snakes. I almost got bit by one rattlesnake because of the rats. See, when you live up in the hills, that&rsquo;s what happens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: The rats draw snakes?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Umm hmm! Tremendously.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: And it was cold enough in Beverly Hills one night to freeze rats?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, oh yeah. See, it&rsquo;s high up. There was a strange mist around, a rainy type of coldness, and the snakes started coming out of the ground to get the rats. I guess I got caught in the middle of this thing. It was awful! [Laughs] </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: How many rats did you have?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Oh, I had quite a few. A lot of them. My mother hated it. I was up to about thirty rats.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Do they reproduce quickly?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Grimaces] Weirdly quickly! You wake up one morning, and you see all these little things crawling around. It&rsquo;s fun anyway.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Nobody clued you in on the rat&rsquo;s habit of eating each other?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Nope. I just saw it when they ate the babies. I shoulda separated the father from the children. I&rsquo;d never see that deal. I had no idea, no idea. I don&rsquo;t think anybody knows the reason why -- it doesn&rsquo;t exist; if they did say it, it&rsquo;s not a good enough reason.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Well, let&rsquo;s go back to the film. How were you approached to do the Scarecrow in The Wiz?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I was sitting at home one day, and the phone rings.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Home in Beverly Hills?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No, we don&rsquo;t live in Beverly Hills no more. We moved. See, we built a studio. And where we were staying we had a lot of room, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. We always wanted to build a studio, &lsquo;cause we were rehearsing in our garage in Beverly Hills and the neighbors complained. And so we moved to Encino, in San Fernando Valley, got a lot more room now, and we built a studio in our house, and so now we record and do a lot more stuff in that house. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s great for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But anyway, getting back: I was sitting at home and the phone rings from our office, and they say, &quot;Hey, Michael! How would you like to do The Wiz?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, where&rsquo;d you get this news from?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, in New York City Rob Cohen and Sidney Lumet called.&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah! I&rsquo;d like to do it!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: The only reason why I said yes was because I knew a lot about the production and getting it together. And I knew it was some of the best people in the film industry working on this thing. Sidney Lumet is the hottest director of the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Had Diana stepped into the project at this time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Laughing] Oh yeah. I had called Diana up in Las Vegas, and she was telling me that she was gonna go to New York and film it, and I said, &quot;Well I hope the best for you!&quot; Next thing I know is I&rsquo;m in the film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: So what sort of preparations have you made to play the Scarecrow? I assume you saw the old Wizard Of Oz movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Oh yeah, I have it on video tape. I watch it sometimes and just turn the sound down and watch the moves. When you see the old one, you realize -- I had to say this -- but you realize that they didn&rsquo;t bring out what they should have brought out. That&rsquo;s what The Wiz is all about -- it&rsquo;s bringing out what Frank Baum, the writer, was really trying to say, in this movie. You can see where a lot was thrown out. We make it more recognizable to people what the story is all about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Give me an example.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Well, the different characters, the Scarecrow with the brain thing. He think he doesn&rsquo;t have a brain, but he does. All the time it&rsquo;s there, but he don&rsquo;t know it. The whole thing is bringing it out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: What I do as the Scarecrow is, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m smart and everything. And all through the movie I be bringing out these quotations from out of my sleeves n&rsquo; all. See, I&rsquo;m garbage instead of straw; I&rsquo;m filled with the stuff, and I&rsquo;m reading these quotations from all over me about such and such: &quot;Confucius said this.&quot; But I still think I&rsquo;m ignorant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: So it will have a larger social impact than a whimsical kids&rsquo; story?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Solemnly] Umm hmm. It&rsquo;s a strong movie. Some people will see it as a kids&rsquo; film, but it isn&rsquo;t. You can follow it as you go through your life. That&rsquo;s the main answer to life -- with that whole movie. I mean you can just follow life with that movie. It&rsquo;s deeper than what people really think it is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Have you read the original book?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Embarrassed] I know I should. I was supposed to read it, but I haven&rsquo;t had the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: If you do, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s not precisely a children&rsquo;s book. Diana Ross recently made the point that it never mentions how old Dorothy is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Dorothy&rsquo;s not really in the story at all. Not that much. It&rsquo;s just the way MGM did it that makes people think she&rsquo;s a big part of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Excited] You can find so many great things in The Wiz about life. There are so many smart people walking around that don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t believe in themselves. It&rsquo;s helpful for that too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: That&rsquo;s what the Scarecrow is all about. He&rsquo;s a smart guy! There&rsquo;s these crows that come every day and jive me and say I&rsquo;m dumb, I&rsquo;m ignorant, I can&rsquo;t walk, I can&rsquo;t do this. And they&rsquo;re so cool they just walk into my garden and take advantage of me. I&rsquo;m begging them, &quot;Can&rsquo;t I get down just for one second and walk in the garden?&quot; They say, &quot;Man, you can&rsquo;t walk!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: One day my break comes when Dorothy helps me down. I&rsquo;ve been reading all these quotes that show how smart I am, but I really don&rsquo;t know it. I know something&rsquo;s wrong with what they&rsquo;re telling me, but I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it, and something&rsquo;s still wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: It just brings out more. It&rsquo;s more of a city story. Instead of straw, it&rsquo;s garbage. The Tin Man is all kinda cans: peanut butter cans, and this and that. Toto is like a German shepherd puppy. It&rsquo;s really great; this is great!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: It&rsquo;s a fantasy look, too. When I say we&rsquo;re gonna be on location, a lot of people think we&rsquo;re just gonna look real-to-life. With a sky like this one [Points out the window] . No, we&rsquo;re gonna give it a real fantasy look. Some of the scenes will have 600 dancers! It&rsquo;s a $12 million production! That&rsquo;s how much they&rsquo;re spending.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: What do you enjoy the most about the filming?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Very Softly] I love the amazing make-up and all the costumes and all the excitement. And I love the dance sequences. We got some dance sequences gonna knock people down! [Giggles] </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Are they working you too hard?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Not at all. It&rsquo;s just the opposite. I never want to stop. Sometimes I even come home in my make-up!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: You&rsquo;re that attached to the character?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Nodding slowly] It takes a long time to put it on my face, but I like how different it feels. I can be in a whole &lsquo;nother place with it. Sometime I wear it at home, and people -- kids -- I look out the back window of the car and let them see me. Whoa, they get frightened! They don&rsquo;t know who or what it is! It&rsquo;s a trip, it&rsquo;s really a trip. [Softly, guardedly] It&rsquo;s a secret; that&rsquo;s it. I like that it&rsquo;s a secret.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Relaxing] It&rsquo;s just a warm feeling inside, like I can do anything he does, and everybody will dig it. Because once he comes down from the pole in that corn patch, everybody appreciates the Scarecrow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: You&rsquo;ve never done a film before, have you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I&rsquo;ve done so much acting but never in a film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: How do you mean?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Well, all the variety I&rsquo;ve done, and different sketches on TV shows. I&rsquo;ve done so much, you know, long sketches. I&rsquo;ve done The Flip Wilson Show and Carol Burnett, all that stuff, Sonny and Cher. But I&rsquo;ve never done a movie. This is the first one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Are you scared?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No. Not at all, not at all. Honest to God, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m challenged. I love it. I&rsquo;m not scared at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Even when I was very small, all I wanted to do was get into this performing kind of thing. But no matter how many movie offers come to me, music will always be my number one thing. Because it&rsquo;s inside of me, and it&rsquo;s something that has to come out. And it&rsquo;s still there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Smiling shyly] Like when I&rsquo;m going over my script, music just comes into my head, and songs, and I run to the tape recorder and put melodies on tape. Constantly. Not to wait for a piano for stuff, because I can&rsquo;t help it. I can&rsquo;t. I got to have it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: What was the first time you performed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: It was in a shopping centre, the Big Top, in Gary, Indiana. It was at a grand opening. All the people come around and buy the season fashions. We agreed to be in front of the mall, in the middle of it, and sing. And that&rsquo;s what we did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: You must have done some performing before that, to have that come about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Mulling] Yeah, but you know, I can&rsquo;t remember. I wasn&rsquo;t even thinking about that. I just did it. I was about six. I got started around five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: What is your earliest memory of performing? Did someone, your father maybe, take you by the hand and ask you to sing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No, we were just singing around the house, old folk songs, Cotton Fields Back Home and [sings] Down In The Valley . . . We used to wake up singing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: We had bunk beds, and I would shack up with Marlon, and Tito would shack up with Jermaine, and Jackie would have his own on top. We would just sing every morning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: See, my father had a group, with his brothers, The Falcons. And Tito would sneak his guitar and play it when he&rsquo;d go to work. When he got caught, Tito would get in so much trouble for playing Dad&rsquo;s guitar. One day Tito broke a string, and my father got so mad at Tito, he got so mad at him, so angry, he said, &quot;Lemme see what you can play! If you can&rsquo;t play that, I&rsquo;m a really beat you!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Tito was scared, but when he could play, my father was shocked. He was so good, by just sneaking and playing. My father thought, Well, there&rsquo;s some kind of talent here, and he started saving up money, buying instruments and microphones and amplifiers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: We would do talent shows in the neighbourhood in Gary, and later at the high school. [Proudly] We would always win every one. We have all these trophies in our house all over the place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: One day Gladys Knight told a guy named Bobby Taylor at Motown about us, and Motown got a hold of us. We did a show on Berry [Gordy]&rsquo;s gigantic estate in Detroit, around the pool side. All the Motown stars were there: Diana Ross, The Temptations, everybody. They loved us, and we recorded our first record, I Want You Back, a three-million-seller. And we went on and on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: How old were you when you got the first hit?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: On &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; I was 1 [typo from source, will correct], but our very first one was a record [in 1968] called &ldquo;I&rsquo;m A Big Boy Now&rdquo; on Steeltown, and it was a Gary, Indiana, company. It was a local hit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Who wrote &quot;Big Boy&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Frowning, shrugs] Boy, I don&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Do you remember how the song goes?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Brightening, smiling] Yes. It&rsquo;s a good melody! It goes: [sings] &quot;Fair-y tales, fair-y tales, have lost their charm. Da-da-da, da-da-da, a-da-da-da. &lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m a big boy now!&quot; It&rsquo;s a good melody. It&rsquo;d be a hit today, really.[Insistent] It could! You know, a lot of these people, they take these old songs and say the same thing thinking, &quot;The kids don&rsquo;t know it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Sure Rita Coolidge has a hit now with &ldquo;Higher And Higher&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: That&rsquo;s right, that Jackie Wilson hit! People don&rsquo;t know, but they take those old songs and bring them back, and everybody think it&rsquo;s something new -- when it&rsquo;s old. And I&rsquo;m just listening to them and thinking, &quot;My mother usta put on these records!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: So your father had a band called The Falcons, right? How much do you know about his band?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Well, it was his three brothers [the band had five members], and they were a little group from the South, with guitar, bass, and drums. Dad&rsquo;s from the South -- Arkansas. I don&rsquo;t know what city.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Did he ever tell you any stories about the early days playing with The Falcons?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No. I don&rsquo;t think he needs to talk about it. We haven&rsquo;t talked about it. He&rsquo;s never talked about it. All we know is that he had a group. We know he was a good player, because they played in Gary when we were little. Then they were split up, but he would just grab his guitar and start playing . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: . . . around the house?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Uh huh.

Did you go out in the country and stuff? Now, business will do that, but that different country and their society and their culture just creeps in anyway. The governments are different, and there&rsquo;s no way that could be like America. Of course, business will remind you -- you look at McDonald&rsquo;s sometime and you forget that you&rsquo;re in England. But they even have McDonald&rsquo;s stands that look different!

See, we just started writing songs on our albums. Before, those songs were all by Motown producers. We would help in, but we would never mainly write the stories or anything. With our singing, we would help in. That&rsquo;s what so great about what we&rsquo;re doing now.

Look what he did to music: all these funky tracks that you hear today, that&rsquo;s where it came from. Sly Stone, James Brown, these are people that started funky music. They stood between the gospelly soul and the dance music. And that&rsquo;s funk: Sly, James Brown, and people like that. Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding. And of course in rock and roll there&rsquo;s Little Richard and Chuck Berry and all those guys. That&rsquo;s who I would always watch.

I just remember him on stage gettin&rsquo; down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I talked with him during rehearsal at a Dick Clark music awards show last year. He said, &quot;I remember you back at the Apollo Theatre. I&rsquo;m the one who got you the gig! One of your biggest breaks!&quot; I said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; He read me the cash receipts from his last tour, and then he broke out into the aisle, sliding and doing the James Brown dance. And then he walked off. [Laughs] </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But you know, rock and roll, at one time, nobody even wanted to hear it. [Laughs] They said, &quot;What is this?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Elvis was considered white trash for singing so-called race music in his hillbilly style.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">See, but when the blacks did it, they really wouldn&rsquo;t accept it. It&rsquo;s only a fact, and it&rsquo;s true. It turned around when people like Elvis did it, but it was there all the time. Blacks had been doing it for years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mostly everybody made fun of it. There&rsquo;s this book called Blues: The Devil&rsquo;s Music, and it talks about the origination of blues, and how people just talked so bad about it. And look what it is today!

And jazz.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: When did you go over and visit with Jackie Wilson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: When we did our album; we just finished it. Not too long ago, in Philadelphia, at the hospital. He really don&rsquo;t get the credit he should get. He&rsquo;s the man the big people of today in the music industry copy after. [After years of hospitalization following an on stage heart attack in 1957, Wilson died in 1984.] </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Does that bother you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yes. I think it&rsquo;s an awful thing. &lsquo;Cause I like the people who really do something; they sweat and work for it and go through hell bringing it about. And the guy who takes it so quick [loudly snaps his fingers] , he comes along and gets all the credit for it. I&rsquo;m glad at least it took somebody to bring it about, but real people should get credit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Same thing with artists that paint. It happens the same way -- till they die, and then they get the recognition.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Have you ever felt that way about things you&rsquo;ve done?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, a lot of things.

I feel it&rsquo;s a compliment in one way, and in another way [voice drops to a whisper] you be kinda angry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Aggressive] Because it&rsquo;s yours. We were the first young group out there with that style, making hit records. There were nobody out there at our age. We came across it, and then all of a sudden along came the Osmonds, the Partridge Family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Now you have groups like the Sylvers have the same producer that wrote all our hits, Freddie Perren. That&rsquo;s why they sound so much like us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: A lot of people that worked with the Osmonds said they would have video tapes on us and study us. They really patterned themselves after us, because they were singing barbershop on The Andy Williams Show. They never were recording jams, poppin&rsquo; soul, then -- boom! -- they were.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: I heard One Bad Apple several times before I found out it wasn&rsquo;t you people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Grinning fiercely] I know! One lady walked up to me and said, &quot;I got your new record.&quot; I said, &quot;What?&quot; She said, &quot;One Bad Apple.&quot; I said, &quot;Lady, why don&rsquo;t you read who&rsquo;s on the label?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Did you know that record was ours at first? But Motown turned it down. George Jackson is the producer, and he came to Motown with it, and Motown turned it down. Because we were in a funky, strong track-type bag, with good melody. George&rsquo;s song was good, but too easygoing; we were striving for something much stronger. So he went and gave it to the Osmonds. [Annoyed] They sang it, and it was a smash -- Number 1.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: He had you in mind when he wrote it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Sure! That&rsquo;s why it was mainly like us all the way. They sounded so much like us. I don&rsquo;t mind if somebody takes it and go farther with it. The only thing I hate is they take it and make like they started it. It&rsquo;s like dog-eat-dog type of situation. I think it&rsquo;s aw-ful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: At least The Beatles did mention where they were influenced. They were great writers, on their own, but they did study black music. &lsquo;Cause Chuck Berry -- who was it, Chuck Berry or Little Richard? -- when The Beatles were coming up he saw them and he introduced them to a lot of people. A long time ago, The Beatles were on an all-black label[Vee-Jay]. The guy&rsquo;s name is [Ewart] Abner -- I know him, he was president of Motown Records -- and a long time ago, he had them! Then, after they went on from there, they were gigantic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love Paul McCartney. With his own records he proves he&rsquo;s the most talented Beatle. When you take any one of them away, it gets kinda weaker and weaker, but as a whole, it was always the best. Paul -- him and John Lennon were dynamite. I&rsquo;ve been to two of Paul&rsquo;s parties, and we get together and talk. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He wrote a song for me, and I never get a chance to record it. Him and his wife were telling me about it. It&rsquo;s called Girlfriend.[Girlfriend was included by McCartney on Wings&rsquo; 1978 London Town album. Michael finally recorded the song in 1979 for his Off The Wall LP.] They were singing it to me, and they say they want to do it, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[He sings] &quot;Girlfriend . . . boyfriend&quot; -- it was an easy thing. I remember him singing it. I&rsquo;ll never forget the melody. I can forget all kinds of things [giggles], but I never forget a melody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was a year ago. I&rsquo;ve got some pictures here of the party. It was a gigantic party at the Harold Lloyd estate. It was a very good evening. All the stars were there! [He pulls a voluminous black scrapbook off a nearby shelf and leafs through it.] Lemme see. This is when we met the Queen . . . This is at Paul&rsquo;s party at Harold Lloyd&rsquo;s estate, right around the time when Paul and his wife and I, were were talking about the Girlfriend song, and exchanging numbers and addresses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That was one of the greatest parties I&rsquo;ve ever been to, because when Paul gives a party he believes in just going out! It was a whole schedule: nine o&rsquo;clock, you get to see the ballerina act. Ten o&rsquo;clock, Chuck Norris, the karate expert, put on a show. At four o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the Broadway company of The Wiz would put on a show. There were all kinds of food! You want Mexican food, they had a Mexican stand, a Mexican lady. Italian, and Italian stand with an Italian man. American food, a buffet! Oh, man!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And that&rsquo;s more at Paul McCartney&rsquo;s party, where they had the Wiz show... And John Belushi doing his Joe Cocker imitation at Paul&rsquo;s thing, too. Did you see the robot on summer TV specials? That was the same robot that was at Paul McCartney&rsquo;s party! That was the first time I had seen it. I said, &quot;How does he work?&quot; People went crazy over him. And that&rsquo;s my friend Tatum O&rsquo;Neal . . . And that&rsquo;s my nephew on my brother&rsquo;s side.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I left kinda early, but the party went on and on . . . </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Do you keep a lot of scrapbooks like this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Flashing a confused glance, continuing to thumb through it] Not really. We have somebody in the business office who makes them up for me, and our own photographer to follow me and take the pictures . . . That&rsquo;s my father&rsquo;s father, Samuel Jackson, and that&rsquo;s the three brothers that had the band the Falcons: Lawrence, Joseph, and Luke . . . Samuel Jackson still around the house; he sings and sings; he&rsquo;s still alive in Arizona. And that&rsquo;s the first monkey on the moon! She&rsquo;s still alive today. Her name is Miss Baker. [He points to an odd scrawl below the shot of the chimp.] See, she &quot;autographed&quot; it. It&rsquo;s good to look back and think. There&rsquo;s Fred Astaire . . . and Minnie Riperton . . . [He puts the scrapbook away.] </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Tomorrow, from when you wake up, what will your schedule for the day be like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I get up at 9.00am or 8.30, and I work on The Wiz at the rehearsals until 5.30pm. Then I&rsquo;m free, unless I have other appointments. I&rsquo;m going to the Parliament-Funkadelic concert tomorrow, which is a form of freedom, but there&rsquo;s no way I can get away from the stage completely. I got to have it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Certain people were created for certain things, and I think our job is to entertain the world. I don&rsquo;t see no other thing that I could be doing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: So many people do so many different things that they&rsquo;re good at. It seems like &quot;He was meant to do that!&quot; or &quot;That&rsquo;s her job!&quot; because of how they enjoy it. It&rsquo;s that way with me and entertainment, and it&rsquo;s strange, because our whole family is in on this thing. We all do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: I notice the Bible over on the coffee table. Is your family especially religious?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: We all believe in God, of course. [Giggles] I study and read the Bible with my mother and sisters. I know there&rsquo;s a true and breathing God. A lot of people don&rsquo;t believe in that, but I know there&rsquo;s no way it can&rsquo;t be. There&rsquo;s no way it couldn&rsquo;t be; it&rsquo;s so true that there is a God, when you break it down: the universe, the beauty of the world, the sun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: But there&rsquo;s a lot of ugliness in the world, too, a lot of cruelty. Did God create that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No! That&rsquo;s because of man! Man is because of the fallen angels. It says in the Bible that all this would happen, and it&rsquo;s all coming true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: It&rsquo;s easy to judge the world from the privileged safety of America. If you&rsquo;d been to India, say, and seen the ugliness there...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I can&rsquo;t wait! That&rsquo;s what I want to see! I&rsquo;ve seen the very rich and the very poor, but I&rsquo;m mainly interested in the poor. I don&rsquo;t wanna think the whole world is just like what&rsquo;s around here. I want to appreciate what I have, and try to help others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I know what the rich are like. I&rsquo;ve studied that country India so much, and when I go to other countries, people say, &quot;You wanna see the ugly part of it?&quot; [Nods] That&rsquo;s what I want to see!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: What are you looking for?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Smiling] I want to see what it&rsquo;s really like to starve. I don&rsquo;t want to hear it, or read it. I want to see it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: It&rsquo;s a whole different thing when you see it! All the things I&rsquo;ve read in my schoolbooks about England and the Queen were OK, but my very eyes are the greatest book in the world. When we did the Royal Command Performance over in England, and then after it I actually looked into the Queen&rsquo;s eyes, it was the greatest thing! And it&rsquo;s really the same thing with starvation! [Dreamily] When you see it, you just receive a little more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: What would you say is the worst thing you ever saw in your life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Well, can it be anything?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Sure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: It was probably during the hard days on stage. Some of the things I use ta see when we used to do nightclub acts.[Giggles] You&rsquo;ll probably say, &quot;Aw, that ain&rsquo;t nothing,&quot; but to me, especially at that stage, I had never seen anything like it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Seen what?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Giggling harder] See, we used to do club shows, and there was this one lady -- you probably know what she did -- but I thought it was awful. I was around six, and she was one of those stripteasers, and she would take her drawers off [giggles], and a man would come up, and they&rsquo;d start doing -- aw, man, she was too funky! Ugh! That, to me, was awful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Looking backward and forward, how do you feel about your body of work?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: All those records in the past are our songs, and we&rsquo;ve sung them, and we put our hearts into the singing of them, but they&rsquo;re not from us. They&rsquo;re not our thoughts and what we think should go on that plastic, on that wax.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: When I get into writing my own stuff, I&rsquo;m gonna just let it all out. It&rsquo;s something I always wanted to do: Make it really me!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Speaking of your thoughts and your heart, do you have any girlfriends?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I&rsquo;m too busy for dating girls right now. I&rsquo;d like to try, maybe. What do you think? Think I should, yeah? Well, I&rsquo;ll think about that. I&rsquo;ll think about what you said. We&rsquo;ll see . . . But I&rsquo;m happy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: You&rsquo;ve certainly got the power to make yourself happy. People live their whole lives and don&rsquo;t find that power. Do you think you&rsquo;ll use it well?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Grim-faced, listing his thoughts on his fingers] OK. For starters, there&rsquo;s nothing inside of me that wants to come out but don&rsquo;t know how. I just let it all come out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: If there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m not, I&rsquo;ll mention it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I love children -- crazy &lsquo;bout &lsquo;em.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I love music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I&rsquo;m looking forward to writing lots of songs and good material and putting it out and just doing my best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: So nothing&rsquo;s bothering me, because I got things that I want to do, and I know I can do them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Adamant] There&rsquo;s nothing inside killing me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">TW: Filming The Wiz and playing the Scarecrow seem to be the high points of your life thus far. Will you be sad to see it end?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [Musing, almost whispering] Ohhh yeah. Sometimes, when I come home with my make-up, I keep dancing in front of the mirrors here as the Scarecrow. Or I get out of bed at night and do a few moves in front of the mirrors.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: When I get into it, I forget everything else but the Scarecrow&rsquo;s world. It&rsquo;s a feeling of peace. It&rsquo;s just like . . . magic.</span></p></body>
