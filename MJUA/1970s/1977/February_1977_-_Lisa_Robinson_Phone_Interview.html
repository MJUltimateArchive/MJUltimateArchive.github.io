I don&rsquo;t [only] mean promotion&mdash;wise. I mean, when they ask you questions, it</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">helps you to think about your life, to look at your future. It makes you think about what</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">you&rsquo;re going to be doing in the next ten years.&rdquo; I asked him if he ever got bored. Only</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">when he was stuck inside a hotel room with too many fans outside, he said. But, he was</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">quick to add, sticking to the script that demonstrated his early Motown media training,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">he felt an obligation to his fans. &ldquo;They made you who you are. They&rsquo;re the ones who</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">buy the records. If an entertainer did a concert and nobody showed up, he wouldn&rsquo;t do</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the concert. So he owes it to them.&rdquo; I asked if he resented never having had a normal</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">childhood. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a thing as talent, and I was taught that this was</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">given to me. If I didn&rsquo;t like doing it, if it [felt like] work, I don&rsquo;t think I would have</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">lasted this long. I&rsquo;d probably go crazy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/09/michael-jackson200909"><span class="cs8567212B">Vanity Fair (September 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Interview with Michael by phone from his home in Encino, California, February 1977:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">You&rsquo;ve been doing this for more than 10 years now; do you ever wonder, if you could have had a different life, what you&rsquo;d be doing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&rsquo;t know . . . It&rsquo;s a lot of fun, you learn a lot of things, and you get into a lot of things. Right now, I write a lot of songs. I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of songs for a long time. I&rsquo;m looking forward to recording them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">What about the celebrity stuff, like when you come to New York and go, for example, with Andy Warhol to Regine&rsquo;s like you recently did?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [Laughs.] It&rsquo;s part of being an entertainer. You know, people talk to you, and they want to know about you. And a lot of entertainers don&rsquo;t know this, but interviewers help entertainers 100 percent. I don&rsquo;t mean promotion-wise; I mean like when they ask you questions, it helps you to look at your future yourself, like when they ask you what you think you&rsquo;ll be doing in 10 years. Interviewers put [entertainers] in a position to think about their life&mdash;where they&rsquo;re going or what they should be doing or what shouldn&rsquo;t they be doing. So it&rsquo;s important, it really is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Do you think your brothers are relieved that they don&rsquo;t have the same burdens you do being the lead singer or do you think they&rsquo;re jealous of the attention you get?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, never. Everybody knows we have certain jobs that we do onstage, and my thing that I do is sing up front, and I dance and lead most of the songs. They know that&rsquo;s my thing and they do theirs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Did you ever have doubts, or worry that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, because it&rsquo;s something that I like to do. I never thought I couldn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a feeling inside of you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">You never get fed up or exhausted or bored?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I get bored sometimes . . . yeah. You have to wait in your hotel room, and all these fans are knocking on your door or waiting outside around the hotel, and all you can do is stay in your room. You can&rsquo;t go anyplace. So that&rsquo;s when I would say I get bored. But you have an obligation to your fans&mdash;they made you what you are. They&rsquo;re the ones who bought the records, so performers who don&rsquo;t sign autographs and stuff are wrong. Someone who does that can&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s right, because he&rsquo;s wrong . . . because if he did a concert and nobody showed up, he wouldn&rsquo;t do the concert. So he owes it to them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Do you go out with girls? Any dates?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I don&rsquo;t date, no. I&rsquo;m not really interested right now. I like girls and everything, but [laughs] . . . Oh, you think I&rsquo;m one of those? No! I&rsquo;m just not that interested right now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Most 18-year-olds don&rsquo;t have to get up every day and rehearse or tour or work 12 hours a day: they have girlfriends, they do sports, they have homework&mdash;they have a different life and they&rsquo;ve had a different life for years. Does it bog you down?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, because it&rsquo;s something I like doing. If it was work, I don&rsquo;t think I could have lasted this long. I&rsquo;d probably go crazy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Do you feel you have a special gift?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, there&rsquo;s such a thing as talent. And, yeah, I would say that&rsquo;s true . . . For instance, with an artist, he can draw anything you look at&mdash;he can draw it. And then you take [someone else], who can&rsquo;t even draw a stick person. So look at the difference.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I like to be at home because we travel all the time, so if we had some time off, we wouldn&rsquo;t go on vacation. We do enough [traveling] when we&rsquo;re working.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Who lives at your family home now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Me, Janet, Randy, and La Toya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">None of the other brothers?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh-uh. The rest live out and are married.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Marlon?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He&rsquo;s married and he&rsquo;s got a baby.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">I didn&rsquo;t know that. What is his wife&rsquo;s name?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Carol . . . but don&rsquo;t print that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">You&rsquo;re not supposed to say they&rsquo;re married? Not Jackie either?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Right, none of them. Don&rsquo;t mention that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">What? That&rsquo;s kind of silly</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">O.K., change the subject. You&rsquo;re on Epic [Records] now&mdash;do you miss Motown at all?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I miss the old days at Motown, the old days. When we first came there we used to live with Diane [Diana Ross] and we&rsquo;d play at the Gordys&rsquo;. We&rsquo;d go to Disneyland and go bike riding and all those things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Have you seen Diana Ross in</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Lady Sings the Blues </span><span class="cs43C038A">or</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Mahogany</span><span class="cs43C038A">? Do you want to act?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Lady Sings the Blues</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was much grander than </span><span class="cs43C038A">Mahogany</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> because she could get into it much more. It was about this singer, and drugs . . . A real actor can do any part, but I want to do something pertaining to show business. Like in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Mahogany,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Diana is great, but she&rsquo;s not a real actress [as much as in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Lady Sings the Blues</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] . . . She inspired a lot of people, though.</span></p></body>
