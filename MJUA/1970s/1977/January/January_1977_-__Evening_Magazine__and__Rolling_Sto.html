That visit took place at my flat near Japantown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I let A&amp;E see some brilliant black-and-white photographs of Michael and his brothers that day, sitting in the living room with two teenagers who&#39;d won a contest for a personal visit with the group, and gathered around the dining table for the interview. There&#39;s a shot of Michael and Randy in the kitchen with me, standing around an island, a bottle of Cinzano nearby. Michael was 18 then, Randy 15 - the vermouth went untouched. Another shot captured Michael holding a book of photographs by Henry Diltz, opened to his Rolling Stone cover portrait from six years before. Michael was smiling as he gazed at his cherubic image. On the magazine cover, we ran a teaser: &quot;Why does this eleven-year-old stay up past his bedtime?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I remember Marlon, his older brother by a year, telling me he and his wife were expecting a baby, and that they hoped to adopt a couple more. Michael chimed in: He wanted to adopt a couple of kids, too, and set an example for others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Image description]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ben Fong-Torres interviews Michael Jackson (left) and Randy Jackson at Fong-Torres&#39; home in San Francisco, Calif., in January 1977.

So if I adopt children, that&rsquo;s actually saving a life. I would see me with probably three.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
