Jackie and Marlon wrote &lsquo;Do What You Wanna.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a mellow in between like &lsquo;Never Can Say Goodbye.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not fast, nor slow. We all wrote &lsquo;Different Kind Of Lady.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s very funky, it&rsquo;s fast &ndash; you can really dance to it, you can really get down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On writing:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yes my favorite activity is writing songs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On his day off:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I just relax at home with my family and friends. I like to ride around on my bike, look at my video tapes, and read.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On his type of girl: &ldquo;I prefer the quiet type. I like girls who are friendly, nice and beautiful in every way. I don&rsquo;t like when people gossip or talk bad about others or judge people before they know them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Favourite musicians and Stevie Wonder:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I really like Stevie Wonder, The Temptations, Diana Ross, The Bee Gees, Ohio Players and Wild Cherry. Stevie is special &ndash; very special &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s super, super, super talented. I&rsquo;ve worked with him lots of times. We recorded lots of songs and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from him &ndash; by singing with him in sessions and just by talking with him. I just listen to the words on his album to know how bright he is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Memorable moments to date:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Meeting the Queen Mother of England. We gave a command performance for her about five years ago. It was a lot of fun. Liberace, Carol Channing and Elton John were also on the show. After it was over she said, &lsquo;You gentlemen are splendid. I honestly enjoyed you. Keep up the good work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Advice to any aspiring youngster wanting to go into show business:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The most important thing is to keep listening.

He was considering taking a role in a film, &quot;The Wiz&quot;, and his main attraction to the part was the fact that a man he&rsquo;d literally worshiped all his life—Quincy Jones—was hired to do the musical score. Usually ultra-conservative in his actions during an interview, I nearly lost consciousness from the sheer shock when Michael grabbed my arm and shaking my body (down to the ground?) with excitement as he hissed: &ldquo;Can you believe it?? Quincy Jones! He&#39;s greaaaaaat!&ldquo; My mind snapped back to the present as Quincy agreed to answer one more question about Michael&lsquo;s new album, something about Michael&lsquo;s &quot;quirky lyrics&quot; and distant personal approach with his lead vocals.</span></p></body>
