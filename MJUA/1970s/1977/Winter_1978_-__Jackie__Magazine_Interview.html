		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jackie&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that &ldquo;The Wiz&rdquo; film was released on October 24, 1978, and that the interview most likely took place a few months before the print date (March 17, 1979), which would most likely fall under Winter 1978.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/2284-Jackie-magazine?p=216178#post216178"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Jackie&quot; magazine (March 17, 1979)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180916232414/https://forums.doyouremember.co.uk/threads/2284-Jackie-magazine?p=216178"><span class="cs8567212B">cover archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (Images 001-002)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although American star Michael Jackson, now starring in &quot;The Wiz&quot;, has been a performer as long as he can remember, he&#39;s a long way from getting tired with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve been singing in public with The Jacksons--my brothers--since I was five, but I still enjoy it&quot;, he told us. &quot;In fact, I think I enjoy singing in front of an audience more than ever because we&#39;ve learnt so much and know more what we&#39;re doing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think we understood&quot;, Michael went on, &quot;even when we were little, what was going on--we&#39;d rehearse carefully and go out to give a show, not just do it without thinking.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of course, having been a star when he was very young leads to some funny moments.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;A lot of people are surprised when they meet me&quot;, Michael grinned. &quot;They still have an image of a little boy and then when they see me, they&#39;re saying &#39;Oh, gee! Yeah, I forgot, you&#39;ve got older, haven&#39;t you!&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But while they were growing up, and touring, The Jacksons&#39; education wasn&#39;t neglected either.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We had tutors all the time; they used to come on tour with us when we were at home&quot;, Michael explained. &quot;We never took that many exams, but I guess I don&#39;t mind too much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think we learnt a lot that other kids don&#39;t have the chance to learn from simply traveling the world and meeting people.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Michael went on to say that there is one drawback in touring so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I get homesick! Not for anything in particular, just for that feeling of being at home with all your family and friends&quot;, he admitted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;At least we have each other, though. We&#39;ve been together a long time, but we&#39;re still a family first and a group second, and so we support and look after each other.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And in between touring the world, making films, and being with his family (if that leaves any spare time!) I wondered what Michael liked to do--any hobbies?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t really have holidays, somehow we never got into them when we were growing up and I guess it&#39;s a sort of habit--if you don&#39;t start you don&#39;t go on&quot;, he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I do have some free time, I like to watch video tapes of old movies--mostly the great musicals. &#39;Singin&#39; in the Rain&#39;, &#39;West Side Story&#39;, that sort of thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Recently, too, of course, Michael&#39;s appeared in his first film musical--&quot;The Wiz&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;&#39;The Wiz&#39; is a musical version of the &#39;Wizard of Oz&#39;. I play the scarecrow who is searching for a brain--not really because he hasn&#39;t got one, but because he doesn&#39;t realize he has one. Eventually, though, he learns to believe in himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was working with people like Diana Ross, Lena Horne, great artists like that--which makes it a terrific experience, even though it took me away from the group for six months.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The other thing Michael does, when he has free time, is to spend as much of it as possible with children. &quot;One thing I&#39;ve always wanted to do, and that&#39;s work with children in some way&quot;, he told me. &quot;I think children, especially the young ones, have a special magic and it&#39;s great to be around that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One day, I think I&#39;d like to be a teacher, or a social worker. Anything, really, that involved children.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Including, one day perhaps, some of his own?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;m not married and haven&#39;t got any plans to marry, though I expect I will eventually!&quot; Michael grinned, &quot;If I do, I&#39;d like a family, but in a way I think I&#39;d like to adopt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It would be marvelous to be able to help kids who otherwise would know poverty and despair in their lives. I guess that&#39;s about the greatest thing you can do, save someone from a bad life and help to give it some meaning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;ve seen children all round the world who have a hard time, and you really want to help everybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We do our best, we do a lot of benefits for causes like blind children, go to hospitals, and, of course, visit and play in schools.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t think the teachers like it all that much. I know that before we arrive, they always give their lecture, saying, &#39;Now, you&#39;ve got to behave properly and sit quiet&#39;, but when we get there, the kids forget all that and go crazy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They let go, have a good time and jump all over everything--still, I don&#39;t think it does any harm to anybody, and since the kids buy our records, but can&#39;t always afford to come to the concerts, it&#39;s great that they get a chance to see us and we get a chance to see them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">More normally, though, it&#39;s in much larger places that The Jacksons perform.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We appear, usually in really big venues--up to thirty thousand seats--and it&#39;s terrific!&quot; Michael says, &quot;That&#39;s the greatest buzz of all, walking out on stage in front of that many people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love it. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the bigger the better! A lot of people might seem to be too many to handle, but once things get going they become one big unit--a mass unit, but still united.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s a feeling you get, it&#39;s in the air, the sharing of what we&#39;re doing, and it&#39;s the most exciting thing I know.&quot;</span></p></body>
