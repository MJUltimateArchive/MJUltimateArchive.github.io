Do you think this will be the beginning of a career in films?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Not really, just once in a while.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: Will you appear throughout the movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: How long will you be in New York?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Probably six months. I&#39;ll stay in an apartment with my sister LaToya.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: Did you have to audition?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: No. The director, Sidney Lumet, called our office and said they wanted me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: So, you responded right away. Was there any doubt whether you&#39;d do it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I thought about it. I knew about the film way before. I had spoken to Diana Ross about it. I thought it would be great to do it, because the director is one of the hottest in the country. He did &quot;Network&quot; and &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. I also liked the play very much and saw it seven times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: Who&#39;s doing the musical score?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Quincy Jones.

How will it differ from the Epic albums Gamble and Huff produced for you and the brothers?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: The album will be very funky.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: If your fans scream for you during concerts, do you notice?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yes, especially if it&#39;s during out slow numbers like &quot;Ben&quot;. But there&#39;s so many screams going on, especially during the fast songs that when you get near the edge of the stage, your ears hurt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: What are some of the things the fans have done to try to meet you during concerts?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Some of the girls hid in our closets in the hotel rooms. Some want to touch us, some want to kiss us, and others just attack us and scream.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cynthia: Do you ever see some of the same fans twice when you&#39;re traveling?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yes. A lot follow us around from place to place.</span></p></body>
