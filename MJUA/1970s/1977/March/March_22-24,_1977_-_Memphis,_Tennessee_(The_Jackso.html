They were in Mem&shy;phis for a con&shy;cert the fol&shy;low&shy;ing evening [March 24, 1977] at Mid-south Coli&shy;seum.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Robert (Robot) A. Hull, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/michael-jackson-on-the-roof-of-woolco-in-memphis-1977"><span class="cs8567212B">Rock&rsquo;s Backpages (June 29, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.strangethingshappeningeveryday.com/2015/09/michael-jackson-seizes-day-and-new-king.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Mirror of full article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the story has been told, the Jackson 5 were appearing that evening in concert and had just visited the South&rsquo;s great R&amp;B radio station, WDIA. Michael and his brothers were eager to please their fans, and that would mean going into the community to sign autographs. So WDIA planned a remote broadcast at a Woolco in the Southgate Shopping Center on South Third.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Woolco was selling Jackson 5 recordings, the manager of the store had never even heard of the group. As a result, nobody at this particular Woolco had anticipated what would happen when they opened the doors of the store despite the fact that the store was actually selling tons of their records.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of course, hundreds, then thousands, of fans rushed in to meet the young pop icons. One estimate is that at least 10,000 people had been waiting in the parking lot to see the group.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The WDIA handlers decided to put the Jackson 5 on the roof for everyone&rsquo;s safety.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Up there, Michael and his fans waved and dropped autographs down to the crowds. People were screaming one name: MICHAEL! MICHAEL! MICHAEL!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Many of the fans were angry because they had not gotten a chance to get close to the group. The enormous crowd gathered into a storm, and people began looting the Woolco store, completely cleaning it out. The store was torn apart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eventually the Jackson family paid for the damages.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One eyewitness who was present at the Great Michael Jackson Woolco Riot describes the event through a similar experience that occurred in Memphis in 1977:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The best way to explain it is like when Elvis Presley died. I was in Sessel&rsquo;s Grocery Store as a sacker across the street from Graceland when people heard Elvis died&hellip; People fell out in the aisles of the grocery store in tears. There were post cards with Elvis&rsquo; picture on them. People took them and walked out of the store with the post cards and put them on the store front glass. People took fruit, busted the glass out, never removing the photo from the glass, cutting themselves&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">The Commercial Appeal (March 23, 2012) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.pressreader.com/usa/the-commercial-appeal/20120323/281775626114927"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">), references Image 002 </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito (from left), Michael, Randy, Jack and Mar&shy;lon Jack&shy;son re&shy;lax and catch up on fan mail in Mem&shy;phis on March 23, 1977. They were in Mem&shy;phis for a con&shy;cert the fol&shy;low&shy;ing evening at Mid-south Coli&shy;seum. The day be&shy;fore, the singing broth&shy;ers from Gary, Ind., vis&shy;ited Woolco&rsquo;s at the South&shy;gate Shop&shy;ping Cen&shy;ter. The store&rsquo;s as&shy;sis&shy;tant gen&shy;eral man&shy;ager es&shy;ti&shy;mated the crowd at be&shy;tween 6,000 and 7,000. The flock caused an es&shy;ti&shy;mated sev&shy;eral thou&shy;sand dol&shy;lars of dam&shy;age in the process, but no in&shy;juries or ar&shy;rests were re&shy;ported. The Jack&shy;sons have been in Mem&shy;phis about 10 days, tak&shy;ing a break dur&shy;ing their two-month con&shy;cert tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;, Black Echoes (April 2, 1977) (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was a small piece in Black Echoes in April, 1977 as the Jacksons learned they had been invited to perform at the Royal Variety performance in May 1977. Speaking from Tennessee to Kymme Jones, where he and his brothers were resting after a successful trip to Venezuela, Michael spoke of the poorly received &lsquo;Joyful Jukebox Music&rsquo; album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They were old songs that would not have normally been put out. They were not true to the previous hit style of the Jackson material.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On returning to play in Britain for the first time in 4 years, Michael said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing London again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also disclosed that he had written 3 new songs for the Jackson next album (Goin&rsquo; Places) and had written a song for Barbra Streisand:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written lots of songs including one for Barbra Streisand among other people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the Jacksons UK visit Michael said he would start work on a solo album. Concerning the possibility of a romance with Tatum O&rsquo;Neil:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s just a rumor &ndash; I know Tatum very well, but that&rsquo;s just a rumor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And films?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking over scripts and things now.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
