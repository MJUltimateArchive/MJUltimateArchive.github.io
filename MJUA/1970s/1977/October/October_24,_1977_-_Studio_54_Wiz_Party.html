On hand were the dancers from The Wiz, his mother Katherine, sisters Janet and LaToya, and brothers Marlon and Tito. Also present were Epic Records executives, CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff, and assorted drag queens. Michael and I sat together on one of the sofas on the side of the dance ﬂoor. He told me that he loved New York City. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the perfect spot for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m in New York I get up early and I have a whole schedule. I&rsquo;m going to see this play, I&rsquo;m going to have lunch, I&rsquo;m going to see a movie. I like the energy. Whenever I come back home, I look forward to going back to New York&mdash;I love the big stores, I love everything.&rdquo; He said he had the time of his life in New York filming (the flop movie) The Wiz, and now, what he really wanted to do, more than anything, was make more movies. &ldquo;I can go on tour and it&rsquo;s exciting, but when it&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;ll be lost to the world. If I do a movie, it&rsquo;s a moment captured for eternity. The stars die&mdash;like Charlie Chaplin&mdash;but his films will be here forever. If he did Broadway and plays while he was alive, he would have been lost to the world.&rdquo; I asked him about working with Diana Ross&mdash;who he adored&mdash;in The Wiz. Michael said, &ldquo;It was incredible. I learned so much from her. We&rsquo;re like brother and sister. She made sure I was okay on the set; she was very protective. I just loved the world of movie making; I love it more than reality. Sometimes I just wish I could wake up in the morning to a big production dance number.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/429850174/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Associated Press&rdquo; (October 26, 1977)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190703202903/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/429850174/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson takes time out for some dancing with Rona, a member of the cast of the movie version of the play &quot;The Wiz&quot;, during a party at New York&#39;s Studio 54 disco Monday night.
