It was always something I wanted to do, because I had always loved the movie, and always fell in love with the scarecrow. I saw the play six times. I&#39;ll do other parts if I like the script as I did with this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We worked outside on the movie a lot, and it was cold, the coldest ever in New York. There were 600 dancers at the World Trade Center, all wearing costumes like swim outfits, and it was so cold a lot of them quit. It took me three hours a day to get the makeup on, and then after I took it off, I&#39;d look like a drug addict, with my eyes all watery and red.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808111151/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/jacksonsshowuway2go.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Interview with Gerry Fallon (1979)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love the film, I loved making it, the things I learned! I just hated to end it! The fact that it was my first film didn&#39;t bother me at all, in fact a lot of the people involved were old friends anyway. Diana I&#39;ve known since I was seven years old. Being around with such brilliant people as Sidney Lumet, the director--just conversing with them you learn so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s a new challenge for me, another world. That&#39;s what I love about show business, you never run out of things to do. I always want to go on working all night, work myself to death.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Along with his music, of course, and even before &quot;The Wiz&quot;, films were Michael&#39;s great love. &quot;I adore films&quot;, he enthuses. &quot;I wish I could eat them, really. Sometimes I hate to face the reality of everyday life. There&#39;s a reality, of course, in films, but it&#39;s more of another life. Like playing the scarecrow, when I put on the costume, it wasn&#39;t me, it was another person. I look at him on the screen and I see another person. Oh, I hated it when they said, &#39;OK, curtain, time to go home&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103423/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/majicmag1.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Disco Dancing&quot; magazine (Issue 8) (1979)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The make-up alone took about three hours everyday to put on. But I didn&#39;t mind. I had such a great time on the movie set.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The whole story of &#39;The Wizard of Oz&#39; is brilliant,&quot; Michael told me as we sipped fresh orange juice together. &quot;The characters in it bring home a certain message. It&#39;s like a fable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The part I play, the scarecrow, represents those people who have a lot to offer, but never allow themselves to reach the top, because they just don&#39;t have any confidence in themselves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve always loved the character of the Scarecrow, even when I saw it when I was small boy in the original movie. I remember feeling so sorry for him and crying whenever he was on the screen.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The movie gave Michael a chance to team up with an old friend, the legendary and beautiful, Diana Ross.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Diana looked after us a lot when we first started. She and I became good friends. I used to stay with her whenever we&#39;d come up to New York. She got me interested in drawing and all kinds of things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One of the nicest things that happened on the movie set was when she brought her daughter and all her school class onto the movie set.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We had such a great time.

I think most do, just because you feel sorry for him. I really studied that character. So, it was amazing that I was asked to do the part. Diana has always dreamed that she would be Dorothy one day... it&#39;s more than coincidence.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It took Michael three hours, every day, at the Astoria Studios in New York, to get made up (he&#39;s kept the wig as a souvenir) and even though he was the newcomer among a case of cinema veterans, he loved every moment of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was a real challenge&quot;, he enthused, &quot;a complete new world... the things I learned!

I&#39;d be so sad, I wanted to be there all night and work to death.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&#39;s one scene where the wicked Evelline has the Scarecrow sawn in half. Naturally enough it&#39;s a dummy body on the table, and Michael himself was in reality kneeling underneath with just his face showing. Plus, since he was only paper and straw, there was no harm done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Even so&quot;, he admitted, &quot;it was jolly scary to see that saw go through me, just a few inches away. And then my nephew and nieces, Tito&#39;s children, were taken to see the film, that&#39;s when they all started crying. &#39;Uncle Michael&#39;s been cut in half!&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;A Very Special Musical Interview Feature With The Stars Of &lsquo;The Wiz&rsquo;&rdquo; 1978 Radio Special, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjjcollectors.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;category_id=182&amp;product_id=3792&amp;Itemid=136"><span class="cs8567212B">MJJCollectors item listing</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190529221416/http://www.mjjcollectors.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;category_id=182&amp;product_id=3792&amp;Itemid=136"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Michael&rsquo;s interview segment, he talks about how much he loves Diana and when he found out she was starring in The Wiz, he called her in Las Vegas: &quot;I hope you have a great time in doing the Wiz...and the next thing I knew, I was in the movie myself! The Scarecrow was always my favorite&quot;. &nbsp;He talks about how he loved the Broadway play with Stephanie Mills, and how during the first reading of the movie, everyone was tense. &nbsp;Then Michael talks about the music being the highlight of the film calling it &ldquo;funky&hellip;you can smell it, that&rsquo;s how strong&rdquo; and then talks about the song &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t Win&rdquo; by saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got a smell to it!&rdquo;, which is then played in its entirety. &nbsp;Michael talks about how he wants the music to turn the movie theatres into a discotech by getting people out of their seats and dancing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When asked what he wants the film to accomplish, he says: &ldquo;I hope this opens up a lot of people&#39;s minds...help a lot of children, as well as grown ups, because grown ups are nothing but children, in a bigger sense. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the main thing&hellip;to help humankind...You can lead your life by this movie, you really can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the second record, Quincy tells about how he got involved in the project, and what it what it was like to work with the cast of the film, including Michael and Diana Ross. &nbsp;The record features dialogue and music from the movie including &ldquo;Ease On Down The Road&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[My favorite song is] the one that Diana and Lena Horne do&hellip; it&rsquo;s called &lsquo;Believe In Yourself,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s my favorite because of what it says.

They were made because every week or so, Stan Winston&rsquo;s Los Angeles-based lab would ship a bunch of the actors&rsquo; freshly made foam-latex appliances to New York, where we shot the movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After I brought the Scarecrow appliances home, I would lightly attach the foam-latex pieces to the Vac-u-Form and pre-color them. It saved a lot of application time when we were in the make-up room at the Kaufman Astoria Studios. Keeping the foam-latex pieces on the form during pre-painting kept them in shape, the way a coat hanger keeps wrinkles out of a coat. On the inside of one of the forms, you can see a few color swatches. I duplicated the color of the Scarecrow&rsquo;s greasepaint in artists&rsquo; acrylic. I put acrylic on the neck ruffle he wore as well, because if I used greasepaint, it would rub off onto his costume.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We were allowed to keep the forms at the end of the movie. I have about five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Every morning I began Michael&rsquo;s make-up by applying a bald cap to keep his hair, which was in very small braids, in place. Next I would apply the foam-latex pieces: a forehead piece, two cheek pieces, a nose piece (which was supposed to look like a Reese&rsquo;s Peanut Butter Cup wrapper), a chin piece and a neck ruffle. They went on in the morning and had to be maintained during the day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Because the Scarecrow was a very cartoony character, Michael made lots of exaggerated facial expressions to bring the Scarecrow to life. The facial calisthenics looked great, but they also loosened the foam-latex pieces, so I would have to re-glue and re-paint the make-up. To remove the make-up at the end of the day, I would stand behind Michael, lift the back of the bald cap and peel it up over his head. The cap and the foam-latex appliances would come off pretty much all in one piece.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But then I&rsquo;d duck down behind his chair so he couldn&rsquo;t see my reflection in the mirror, put the make-up (which now looked like a spooky mask) on my hand, slowly raise it up behind his head and jiggle it, going, &ldquo;OOODLE-OOODLE-DOOODLE-DE-OOOOHHH!&rdquo; He would laugh like crazy, as if it were one of the funniest things he&rsquo;d ever seen. I really enjoyed his childlike sense of humor; I could say or do any dumb thing and it would get a big laugh. I would then remove the remainder of his make-up, glue and adhesives and that would be it. We&rsquo;d go home and get ready for the next day&rsquo;s shooting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fun and Games</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When we were talking one day, I told Michael that when I was a little boy, I taught myself how to draw, which was pretty much the beginning of my becoming a make-up artist. He asked to see an example. I took a pen and drew a quick sketch of the Frankenstein monster. He liked it. He said that he and his brothers and sisters sometimes played a game to fight boredom: One of them would draw a few abstract lines on a piece of paper, give it to another sibling and say, &ldquo;OK, now make a fire engine out of this, or a tree,&rdquo; etcetera, and the other sibling had to complete the drawing in a certain amount of time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I played the game with Michael, I tried to trick him by drawing a few curvy lines that I felt did not suggest a cat. As far as I was concerned, these curvy lines looked nothing like a cat. So I said, &ldquo;Go ahead, make a cat out of these lines!&rdquo; And within 30 seconds he had drawn a cat. Not as I would have pictured one, standing on all fours, but a pussycat curled up asleep.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then he made a couple new drawings on the spot, and I kept them with his blessing. One of the drawings was of a man&rsquo;s face. (Images 001 and 002) It&rsquo;s pretty sketchy and kind of impressionistic, but there are a couple of eerie similarities between the drawing he made and his own face, later on...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the Outside</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&rsquo;s a phenomenon that frequently occurs when a make-up artist and an actor work together: instant intimacy. Make-up artists and hairstylists are kind of like psychiatrists or bartenders. You&rsquo;re in the same room, physically close for hours at a time, sometimes for many days. Because people usually have the urge to talk, the subject matter often changes from chitchat to some very serious subjects. And though the two of us were only together to work on a movie, we got to know each other pretty well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I asked Michael over for dinner one night. We had to keep quiet about it, because if anybody found out, word would spread like wildfire. It was 1978 and at age 19, Michael was already well-known around the world. So he came over to our apartment in Bergenfield, New Jersey with his armed bodyguard, Spence. Dinner was Cornish game hens and, by Michael&rsquo;s request, Stove Top Stuffing, which he said the folks in his hometown of Gary, Indiana referred to as &ldquo;dressin&rsquo;.&rdquo; When he ate, he really dug in: He got food all over his face, all over the table, all over his clothes. He was very passionate about anything he did, and I suppose eating was one of those things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We had a great time that night. Because I play guitar a little, I showed him how to play some easy chords on my acoustic guitar. He had always admired people who could play musical instruments and had often fantasized about being the lead guitarist in a rock band.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At that time, the comedian Robert Klein had made an appearance on Saturday Night Live; he came out with a harmonica, gave the band the downbeat by stomping his foot, and cried, &ldquo;Lemme hear some blues!&rdquo; The band struck up the introduction to a blues number and he began playing the harmonica with them, stomping his feet, leg pumping in time. After the opening 16 bars, he pulled the harmonica from his lips and, foot still stomping, sang, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop my leg, little darlin&rsquo; &hellip; I can&rsquo;t stop my leg, little guurrl!&rdquo; Well, Michael got a big kick out of this. So while I played a blues chord progression on my guitar, Michael stomped his foot and sang, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop my leg!&rdquo; At one point while he was singing, he said, &ldquo;Now listen to me, people&rdquo; and I broke up because he was really getting into it. From this visit, I got the sense that he was a very normal, healthy kid.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I got to know the great Michael Jackson a little. He told me once that whatever he happened to be doing&mdash;working on a movie, cutting a record, appearing live on stage&mdash;it was the most important thing in his entire life while he was doing it. It really showed. No matter what he was doing, his talent spoke&mdash;and sang, and danced&mdash;for itself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was a very special person whose life was a combination of extremes. He enjoyed normal, down-to-earth things, but he also earned lifetime membership to a very exclusive club. His talent, tempered by lifelong discipline, reached the hearts of countless admirers and reshaped music for all time.

Blige, David Alan Grier and Stephanie Mills, there was </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, a 1978 movie based on the musical of the same name.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This earlier production of </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> could have been so much better. It had a great concept (an African-American take on &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&rdquo; in which the characters don&rsquo;t follow the yellow brick road, they ease on down it), a strong director (Sidney Lumet, who&rsquo;d just done </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dog Day Afternoon</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Network</span><span class="csD5D7D290">) and a solid cast (Diana Ross as Dorothy, Richard Pryor as the Wiz, Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man). And it had Michael Jackson, a year before he would start his solo career with immortal dance hits such as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough&rdquo; and &ldquo;Off the Wall.&rdquo; But </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was most important for what happened behind the scenes&mdash;veteran producer Quincy Jones, Lumet&rsquo;s longtime film-score colleague, was musical director, and he met his future &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; collaborator MJ by correctly pronouncing &ldquo;Socrates&rdquo; to the young singer on set. Later, Jones called his new friend and listened intently as MJ explained he could hear fully formed songs in his head and needed someone to help write them down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">came along at a perfect time for Berry Gordy and Motown Records. To finish </span><span class="cs43C038A">Lady Sings the Blues</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Gordy had to sink in $2 million of his own money because Paramount&rsquo;s top executive, Frank Yablans, had told him the maximum a studio could spend on a black film at the time was $500,000. &ldquo;This is not a </span><span class="cs43C038A">black film,</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rdquo; Gordy corrected him. &ldquo;This is a </span><span class="cs43C038A">film </span><span class="csD5D7D290">with </span><span class="cs43C038A">black stars.</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rdquo; There were clashes on the set, as star Diana Ross made her transition from music diva to Hollywood diva, demanding an upgrade of her period-piece wardrobe. But the 1972 drama was a success in the end, drawing five Oscar nominations, although Ross lost Best Actress to Liza Minnelli of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Cabaret</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1977, Motown bought the rights to </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, a script based on a Broadway hit with African-American stars putting their own spin on </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wizard of Oz</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Gordy and producer Rob Cohen cast Ross, then 33, as Dorothy. The director who signed on, after a number of false starts, was Sidney Lumet, who had collaborated with a young Al Pacino on </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dog Day Afternoon </span><span class="csD5D7D290">and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Serpico</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. At 53, Lumet was an old Hollywood hand with fast-talking charisma, ending sentences with &ldquo;darling sweetheart.&rdquo; To give </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">an orchestral punch, Lumet sought out an old friend to request a favor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He called Quincy Jones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q didn&rsquo;t want to do it. Jones liked only three songs from the Broadway show&mdash;&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brand New Day,&rdquo; and a funky ensemble number called &ldquo;Ease On Down the Road.&rdquo; But he felt indebted to Lumet, who&rsquo;d hired him for many film scores in the past. &ldquo;I felt I owed him more than one,&rdquo; Jones said of Lumet. &ldquo;I owed him a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lumet stocked </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">with top-tier African-American talent&mdash;Ross, Richard Pryor, Lena Horne. Rob Cohen, head of Motown Productions, thought Michael Jackson would be perfect for the role of the Scarecrow, and he approached Gordy with the idea. To his surprise,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gordy agreed. &ldquo;Aw, Michael&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said the Motown chief not far removed from years of litigation with the Jacksons over contracts. &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s a star.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lumet was harder to convince. He wanted Jimmie &ldquo;J. J.&rdquo; Walker, star of TV&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Good Times</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. &ldquo;Michael Jackson&rsquo;s a Vegas act. The Jackson 5&rsquo;s a Vegas act,&rdquo; the director told Cohen. Quincy Jones was skeptical of Jackson, too, but Cohen arranged a meeting, flying 19-year-old MJ to New York. Finally, Lumet and Jones saw the qualities that Cohen saw. &ldquo;That boy is so sweet! He&rsquo;s so pure!&rdquo; Lumet exulted. &ldquo;I want him as the Scarecrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The final barrier was Joe Jackson, who wasn&rsquo;t thrilled about Michael doing a project that separated himself financially from the rest of his siblings. Cohen mollified Joe by offering roughly $100,000 for Michael to play the Scarecrow. When </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">began filming in New York, the 27-year-old producer moved Michael and La Toya into a Manhattan apartment, and Michael was on his own for the first time. He lived a normal life, except for a strange habit Cohen happened to discover&mdash;taking baths in Perrier water.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The shoots were long and grueling, lasting all day underneath the World Trade Center towers. At night, the young cast went out to play in New York City. Cohen took Michael, along with other members of the cast, to Studio 54, the disco hot spot known for both its crazy sexual escapades and celebrity regulars like Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Cary Grant, and Brooke Shields. The rest of the club took notice whenever Michael Jackson danced. &ldquo;The gay side of the dance floor would stop,&rdquo; Cohen says, &ldquo;and the hetero side would stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During lunch on </span><span class="cs43C038A">The</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> </span><span class="cs43C038A">Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">set</span><span class="cs43C038A">, </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Lumet, the director, told an oblivious Michael that women around him were &ldquo;like ricocheting bullets all over the place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the set, Michael took extremely seriously his choreography sessions with Louis Johnson, who&rsquo;d been a pioneering African-American ballet dancer over years of punishing Hollywood racism. In the film, Michael&rsquo;s most impressive steps are with Diana Ross, as he clumsily learns to walk after being imprisoned by crows on his scarecrow pole. In giant clown shoes, he stumbles, rolls on the ground, and knocks out his knees. &ldquo;He had seen Charlie Chaplin. He was a great fan of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly,&rdquo; says Johnson, who is in his early eighties, by phone from his New York home. &ldquo;So I let him use it &hellip; He asked me, &lsquo;Could I do this?&rsquo;&mdash;and then enhanced it.&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s Scarecrow costume was hot and cumbersome, with a huge curly wig, a hat and vest stuffed with scraps of newspaper, not to mention a painted-on nose. Tony Walton, the film&rsquo;s production and costume designer, didn&rsquo;t know Michael was tormented by his brothers&rsquo; constant teasing&mdash;they called him &ldquo;Ugly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Big Nose.&rdquo; &ldquo;He was thrilled to have his nose covered,&rdquo; Walton says. His costume, stuffed with newspaper and bits of trash bags, was more cumbersome, but Jackson made it work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy Jones was always present. (In the film, Jones appears dressed in gold, playing a giant piano in Times Square.) He, too, began to pay attention to Jackson. When it came time for the Scarecrow part, Michael stepped to the microphone and began to sing, not the bright-sounding Michael Jackson of &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; but the 18-year-old MJ whose voice had evolved into something as smooth and powerful as the Concorde. Cohen, the producer, noticed Jones gaping. &ldquo;He looked at Michael the way a jaguar looks at a goat,&rdquo; Cohen says. &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;I want </span><span class="cs43C038A">him.</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones made his move on the set. At one point, he took Michael aside to explain a Scarecrow bit in the script&mdash;that the Greek philosopher&rsquo;s name is pronounced &ldquo;</span><span class="cs43C038A">Sock</span><span class="csD5D7D290">-ra-tees&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Sow-</span><span class="cs43C038A">cray</span><span class="csD5D7D290">-tees.&rdquo; As Jones would tell the story, he asked Michael right then if he could &ldquo;take a shot&rdquo; at producing his next solo album. That stuck with Michael. During </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">post-production, he called Quincy unexpectedly during a rare home hiatus from touring. They were on the line for 45 minutes, the experienced producer doing most of the talking, about studio equipment, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Star Wars, </span><span class="csD5D7D290">the newest synthesizer models, and unfinished </span><span class="cs43C038A">Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">clips he&rsquo;d seen. Michael mostly listened, with &ldquo;mmm-</span><span class="cs43C038A">hmms</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rdquo; and an occasional &ldquo;whoo!&rdquo; When Quincy enthusiastically mentioned he&rsquo;d seen the Rolling Stones perform, Michael sniffed, &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s not talent, though.&rdquo; The key moment in this nascent partnership came when Michael said he&rsquo;d been writing songs: &ldquo;I hear something in my head. I make the sounds with my mouth&mdash;I can do that.&rdquo; Quincy became excited. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an instrument that can make the sounds you want. I can write anything down on paper,&rdquo; the veteran arranger said. &ldquo;If you can hear it, I can write it down.&rdquo; The exchange, which MJ recorded, ends with Quincy requesting his number.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">cost $22 million and did not perform well at the box office. It was a spectacular, flawed experiment. Michael and Diana have terrific chemistry, but Ross is mismatched for the part. Not because she&rsquo;s too old (although she is), but because she plays Dorothy the same way she played Billie Holiday, with an emaciated world-weariness, when the part, as Judy Garland had shown the world forty years earlier, called for a wide-eyed, childish wonder. A less obvious problem was that during filming, Lumet&rsquo;s wife at the time, Gail Jones, daughter of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">star Lena Horne, had approached the director on set and asked for a divorce. The usually exuberant Lumet became despondent&mdash;a quality that came out distinctively in the film, recalls production designer Tony Walton. &ldquo;Everybody has a crying jag&mdash;the Lion cries, and Diana Ross and the Tin Man,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;None of which was really in the script.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">has its timeless qualities, especially the lovingly rendered scenes to Lumet&rsquo;s home city, prominently showing landmarks such as Coney Island, Shea Stadium, and the Brooklyn Bridge. But its reception was marred by racist backlash. Theater chains in white neighborhoods wouldn&rsquo;t schedule </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz </span><span class="csD5D7D290">for fear of scaring off white regulars, producer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cohen recalls glumly. &ldquo;As big and as spectacular and as musical as it was,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we never got a real solid distribution.&rdquo; Black films, aside from </span><span class="cs43C038A">Shaft</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, were for black audiences. White films were for white audiences. Just as black music, despite brief exceptions such as Motown and disco, had been for black radio stations and white music for white radio stations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Somebody needed to fix this problem.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Randy Jackson, Michael&rsquo;s youngest brother, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115137/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/blackmusicjazz.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Black Music &amp; Jazz Review (April 1979)&rdquo;</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Randy says that Michael is very excited with &quot;The Wiz&quot;. &quot;He loved it.
