Peter Firth came over to me, he&#39;d imported a girl from England for all the publicity and she was there and we had a good time. There was lots of food, but I&#39;d already eaten, Then Peter Firth wanted to take the girl dancing so we walked over to Studio 54 for the Elton John thing. Stevie [(Steve Rubell)] invited us all up to the booth where Michael Jackson was and Michael was sweet—in his high voice he asked me about art. David Hockney was there. The photographers were there and wanted Elton John and me to pose for pictures together so I asked Elton if I could kiss him, but he didn&#39;t answer me so I didn&#39;t. Maybe he didn&#39;t hear me. He was wearing a hat because of his hair transplant.</span></p></body>
