Does anyone know where he was sitting? Who was he? Did he have any luggage? Until we find out I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to delay take-off.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The minutes pass.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;ve now found out who the man was. But we&#39;re not sure if he planted a bomb. It could take up to two hours to locate his luggage, 20 minutes at the earliest.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No one panics. All everyone wants is a drink. It&#39;s getting hot. Can we smoke? Do we have to stay in our seats? Is there really a bomb? Is it near me? Should I panic or just give out a nervous laugh and act brave?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we have located the man&#39;s luggage, we are now ready for take-off after we get the OK from control.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s like a scene from a movie. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three hours after boarding the plane we&#39;re in those white cream puffs in the sky and on our way to New York. The following day it&#39;s an interview with Michael Jackson to talk about his movie &quot;The Wiz&quot;, a remake if &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;. Michael plays the part of the straw man looking for a brain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We meet at his exclusive apartment on the 32nd floor overlooking the Hudson River.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">CSB people, photographer Mike Putland, and I are greeted by Michael&#39;s sister La Toya and shown into the lavish and very tastefully decorated apartment. Michael&#39;s in another room but a few minutes later he comes out to greet us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He&#39;s taller than I expected, dressed all in black with a fisherman&#39;s hat perched on his head. &quot;I&#39;m wearing this to hide my hair&quot;, he says, &quot;I have to tie my hair into plaits for the movie.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We sit down and it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s nervous talking in front of the CBS people so he invited me into his study to do the interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are rows and rows of video cassettes on shelves on the wall. Old and new movies including &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He disappears into &nbsp;a cupboard and changes his hat for a deerstalker.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He looks a little more relaxed but questions tend to be longer than answers. Answers turn to questions and he drifts onto other subjects as often as he changes hats.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Can you blame him? He&#39;s been singing since he was five, his records have sold over 60 million copies, he&#39;s won innumerable awards and has probably been interviewed as many times. What would you do when a nerd (but a charming one) like me asks you the same questions you&#39;ve been asked hundreds of times before?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today though it&#39;s a new subject: it&#39;s the first day&#39;s shooting of &quot;The Wiz&quot; and for the past two months Michael&#39;s been getting up early, learning his lines and working with a whole new bunch of people. Is it much different from working with your brothers?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s fun, there&#39;s a lot more rehearsing and it&#39;s a lotta work. I&#39;m also learning a lot which is great. It&#39;s been more relaxed working on a film than for TV work with my brothers. Everything for TV is rushed. With the movie you have time to study and work out your dance routine and learn your part properly.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One person Michael isn&#39;t new to is Diana Ross who plays the lead role of Dorothy. What&#39;s it like to be working with her again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love it, she&#39;s a great lady, a special lady.&quot; There, I warned you about those short answers. Are they keeping to the original script of &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, it&#39;s changed, it brings out the real meaning of what original writer L. Frank Baum, was trying to say. It&#39;s a city journey instead of a country one. It&#39;s a huge production, we have 600 dancers working on the set each day. We all get up early in the morning and work until 5:30. But I have a long process before I start working. It takes five hours to make me up. They&#39;ve made a mold of my face and they have to put corn all over that. Then we can actually start shooting.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael gets up to show me some paintings of the character and shots from rehearsals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were rehearsing at the biggest ballroom they could find in New York. They&#39;re using an old building where a lot of Laurel and Hardy and Rudolph Valentino movies were made. The movie is saving the studio because it was just going to waste.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Expense seems no object.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That&#39;s right, the stuff they&#39;re rebuilding is incredible. THe yellow brick road will run over the Brooklyn Bridge and all over the city. They have miles of yellow linoleum. We&#39;ll be filming that very early in the mornings, stopping traffic and closing off roads. We have a great director, Sidney Lumet, he&#39;s so smart. His last was one of the biggest ever, &#39;Network&#39;. He&#39;s also done &#39;Dog Day Afternoon&#39;, &#39;Murder on the Orient Express&#39;, &#39;Twelve Angry Men&#39;, and &#39;The Anderson Tapes&#39;. All of his movies are a success. He&#39;s won lots of Academy awards. We have a great rapport with each other. He helps me alot and I need it too.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When this one&#39;s finished are there any plans for more films?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;If they&#39;re right, if they look good and sound good. We&#39;ve been getting scripts for years. For all of The Jacksons are individual members. But this one sounded the best. I always wanted my first movie to be a musical. I&#39;d like to do something different for my next one. Probably something dramatic.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Michael&#39;s only just 19 he&#39;s put a lot of work behind him. Does he ever get tired?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, none of it&#39;s tiring, I love it all. If I didn&#39;t like what I was doing I don&#39;t think I could have survived this long. You have to like it to be doing it as long as I have.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael starts tapping his fingers, fidgets in the chair and talks about The Jacksons&#39; new single, &quot;Goin&#39; Places&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s just come out and it got into the chart at Number 87. Out of all of our records this one has come on really quick.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Has the move to CBS from Tamla give The Jacksons new energy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We have more control over what we want to do. We&#39;re writing our own songs now. We&#39;ve been putting our hearts into other people&#39;s writing in the past. There&#39;s two of my songs on the new &#39;Goin&#39; Places&#39; album. They&#39;re &#39;Different Kind of Lady&#39; and &#39;Do What You Wanna&#39;. We may take one of my songs for our next single.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While Michael&#39;s working on the film what are his brothers doing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They&#39;re on holiday but when the movie&#39;s finished we start touring again. That&#39;ll be in January. We&#39;ll be going back to Britain around then. When we were there last time, playing in front of The Queen, there was trouble--two policemen got stabbed but everything was kept quiet. After the next tour I&#39;d like to write and work with different artists. Barbra Streisand is going to record the song I wrote for her. I&#39;d also like to write one for Dan Fogelberg, write a hit song for him. He&#39;s got a great voice. But first I&#39;d like to write and produce for The Jacksons.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael starts moving again. Talks about punks and says he doesn&#39;t like the music. Although he hasn&#39;t heard much or even heard of the Sex Pistols. Then he starts me question. What&#39;s Paul McCartney doing? Is he going to sign for CBS? THe interview is over and Michael suddenly becomes relaxed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He shows me old videos of The Jackson Five on the Ed Sullivan Show, dances around the room and tries on a few more hats.</span></p></body>
