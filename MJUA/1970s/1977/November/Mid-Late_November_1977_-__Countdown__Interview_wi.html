So, I contacted CBS, Epic at the time, which is now Sony, and said, &quot;I&#39;d like to do this interview with Michael Jackson. I know he&#39;s in town doing &#39;The Wiz&#39;, and [unintelligible] said, &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t bother about that. I wouldn&#39;t have it as a priority, because he&#39;s not with The Jacksons; it may not work.&quot; So, they agreed to do it, and it was very cold--very, very cold in New York, and it was the last interview for the day. It was supposed to be around about 6 o&#39;clock; we were running really quite late, and it was blizzardly cold. And I said to Grant, one of my producers at the time, &quot;He&#39;s not going to be there.&quot; And we pulled up, and there, huddled in the corner, by himself, no record people, no nothing, was Michael Jackson... The thing that actually surprised me though--I remember this initially--when he finally came out of the corner, and then went into the thing... you&#39;d always thought of little Michael Jackson from The Jackson 5. He was not at the time by now, and he was tall, which sort of threw me, but he still had that wonderful thing, where he giggles and that, and he talks about his sister, and that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/michael-jackson-was-two-people-20090626-cz19.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Sydney Morning Herald (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meldrum recalled an interview he did with Jackson at Studio 54 in New York when he was about to launch as a solo artist. The record company representative at the time said not to worry too much about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;(He) more or less said to me, well don&#39;t worry about that because we don&#39;t really think it&#39;s going to work.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But they did manage to do the interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were running late and I said don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t be there. We pulled up and there huddled in a corner was Michael Jackson waiting for us. No bouncers, no nothing and he actually came into the studio and helped us set up the lighting and he was just so captivated by the camera the cameraman had. And he just giggled his way right through the interview.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Autobiography, &ldquo;The Never, Um, Ever Ending Story: Life, Countdown and Everything in Between&rdquo; (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/libro-michael-jackson-molly-meldrum-the-never-um-ever-ending-story.128700/"><span class="cs8567212B">translated Spanish excerpts</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190523194157/https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/libro-michael-jackson-molly-meldrum-the-never-um-ever-ending-story.128700/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While Michael Jackson was working on The Wiz, I was in America traveling with Countdown. After much persuasion and perseverance, I was able to arrange an interview with Michael Jackson at Studio 54. It was scheduled at 5pm and it was a cold, wet and windy day in New York. And as usual, we were late for the appointment. Grant Rule and I arrived almost an hour late and said, &#39;He will probably be gone by now and I do not blame him for that.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But to my surprise, when we pushed the door of Studio 54, we saw a small figure huddled in the doorway. Michael was there alone, with no security or record label, ice cream cold but very cheerful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We went inside and started preparing everything for the interview. Michael even helped the kids with the lighting and set the microphones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The interview lasted about fifteen minutes. He was shy, but I&#39;ll never forget the way he laughed when I asked him about his &#39;funky little sister&#39;, Janet. &#39;Yes it&#39;s funky,&#39; he said laughing. We ended our talk by thanking him for his patience and wishing him the best for his film and his new album, on which he planned to work in 1978.</span></p></body>
