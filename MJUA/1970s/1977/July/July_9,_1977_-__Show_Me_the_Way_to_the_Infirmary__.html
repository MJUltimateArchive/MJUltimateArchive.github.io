At Motown they would learn the songs in the studio. While now at Philly they rehearsed the songs for a week before entering the studio. Michael was uncomfortable at Motown with them telling him how to sing a song most of the time and felt it wasn&rsquo;t good for him. There was also a back catalogue of unreleased songs that Motown still owned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There were some great songs that they haven&rsquo;t used which Stevie Wonder recorded with us; they can release those whenever they want to. He recorded about six songs with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael talks about a record signing they did before one of their shows that got out of control. Too many fans pushed their way in and began stealing the records. The store had to close down. But Michael stated that the worst had been in San Francisco when a big glass window was pushed in and caused fans to get cuts and bruises.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It seems these incidents were not only confined to record stores. The week before the Fort Worth show, one of the giant speakers fell and landed on a young girl. Michal was amazed she found it funny.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There was a big hole in her nose, she was bleeding all over, yet she said she was glad she got hurt because it gave her a chance to meet us. As the ambulance took her away she said she was feeling happier than she&rsquo;d ever been in her life.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
