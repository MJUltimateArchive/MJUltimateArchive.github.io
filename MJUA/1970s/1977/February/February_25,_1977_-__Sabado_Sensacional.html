He would always sing like he was on `Idol.&#39; It was like when you put your car in neutral, and then the minute he went onstage it went on. All artists have that, but I&#39;ve never seen that transformation to that degree. It was truly unbelievable. He was very friendly, very sweet, very professional. They were already huge, but he still hadn&#39;t drawn into his Michael Jackson persona. I was 25 at the time and he was 19, and I remember he even taught me a dance step. We were shooting a TV show in and he did this step and I said, &#39;How in the hell did you do that!&#39; And he said, &#39;Let me show you.&#39; And in fact, after working that show, I decided to quit law school and continue in this business.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Samm Brown, producer and songwriter</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The knock at my hotel room door was barely audible, but it was insistent. I remember opening my eyes and thinking, &ldquo;Who the hell is knocking at my door, waking me up?&rdquo; I looked at the hotel radio-clock on the nightstand and it read, 8:00 AM, Caracas, Venezuelan time, exactly. Another knock again. Actually, it was more like a soft tap-tap-tap.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I got up thinking it must be room service, or perhaps maid service had made a mistake on a room number. I threw on some clothes, went to the door and said, in a gruff and irritated voice, &ldquo;Who is it!!??&rdquo; A soft voice came back, &ldquo;Samm it&rsquo;s me, Mike, open the door.&rdquo; I opened the door and there was Michael Jackson, with his hat and coat on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sorry to wake you up. Wanna go to the amusement park with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Now???&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yeah, now. I can&rsquo;t find anyone who&rsquo;ll go with me, except Bill Bray.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bill Bray was Michael&rsquo;s personal bodyguard and head of his security team.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of course I went with them that morning so many years ago, and I can tell you now that if there is an amusement park in heaven, you can be sure that Michael Joseph Jackson, one of earth&rsquo;s better angels, is on it.</span></p></body>
