		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Look Out! The Jacksons Are Back!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range confirmed in Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Nathan, &ldquo;Blues &amp; Soul&rdquo; magazine (February 1-14, 1977) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105601/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/bluessoul1.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the more dramatic announcements of 1975 came when The Jackson Five made it known that they had concluded a new recording pact with Epic Records for &ldquo;an undisclosed sum&rdquo; after many years of success with Motown Records, they company that put the group on the map and with whom they enjoyed a string of big hits (&ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo;, &ldquo;ABC&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There&rdquo;, on and on) and became established as a musical institution.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But as Quincy Jones once stated with eloquence, everything must change. And the one question puzzling everyone after all the talk of the lawsuits and family disagreements (brother Jermaine Jackson, husband of Hazel Gordy - Berry&rsquo;s daughter - stayed with Motown) was what would happen to the fine young men once they joined the cast CBS conglomerate?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like, who would produce them? Away from Motown, would they survive?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, Marlon, Tito, Jackie, and Randy obviously had no doubt themselves about their own musical abilities. After wowing audiences internationally for years, they could hardly be deemed novices in the field of entertainment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the maxim goes, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re only as good as your last hit record&rdquo; and in a field as competitive as the one The Jacksons find themselves (with groups like The Sylvers having emerged to challenge the family to their status as superstars) in, it was imperative that whatever came out from The Jacksons&rsquo; pacting with CBS could have to be really somethin&rsquo; else!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wisely, both CBS and The Jacksons decided to opt for probably the most successful team of soulful producers in music today. None other than Gamble and Huff! And under their direction at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, The Jacksons came up with what looks like one of their biggest albums to date.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During an ultra-brief break from the recording of their own CBS television series (yet another advantage of being with the company) we got a chance to rap with four of the brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There were a few other producers in mind - like Maurice White of Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire. But he was busy on the road. We were more than happy to have gotten the chance to work with Gamble &amp; Huff - it was a fabulous experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When we first went down to Philly, they allowed us to listen to the material they&rsquo;d prepared for us and we selected what we liked. They gave us complete freedom. And we went for songs with nice melodies, with messages, songs that had some kind of meaning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;On top of that, we were allowed for the first time to include two of our own songs - &ldquo;Style of Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blues Away&rdquo;. They were written by Tito and Michael and we intend to get more into writing in the future.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The basic aim for the group in the future seems to be to project that they are no longer little children. Part of the problem of being youthful stars seems to have been that The Jacksons have been typecast as &ldquo;forever young&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re intent on letting everyone know that they&rsquo;re grown up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Our new show is going to be a whole lot different from what we were doing in the past. It&rsquo;s going to involve more stage action, it&rsquo;s going to be much more of a production thing with all kinds of visual tricks!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll still be using our sisters - but only in our Vegas show. Eight people is a lot to be carrying around everywhere and the girls are more than happy to be joining us whenever we do our television series or the Vegas shows.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout the years, the team has probably the spent as much as 50% of their time on the road. &ldquo;We really enjoy it. We get a chance to get across to people, to meet different people, personalities. When we go overseas - as we&rsquo;ll be doing again in January to South America - we get the opportunity to see different cultures too. And that&rsquo;s hip.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Already, The Jacksons plan to do a 25-day tour of the States during February although they are aware that television is just as important a medium as anything else for getting exposure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You have to remember that there must be people in small towns everywhere who just don&rsquo;t get a chance to get to concerts. So television provides them with the entertainment, allows them to see us. And we want to use our own series as a vehicle for presenting other talent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re concerned about that as far as producing is concerned too. We&rsquo;re interested in eventually working with new acts who haven&rsquo;t had the breaks yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eventually, The Jacksons say they&rsquo;d like to be doing maybe four or five specials a year rather than a continuous series on television.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We want to expand our creative talents into more writing for example. We have our own publishing companies and we&rsquo;re constantly getting songs from other people so we want to develop that side of our activities.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As yet, the team don&rsquo;t know whether they will hook up again with Gamble &amp; Huff for subsequent albums.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how this album turns out and take it from there. But our main aim right now is to establish The Jacksons back out there - that the original concept of five of us. Then maybe one day, we can grow to the point where we can produce ourselves - who knows?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Right now, we want people to know that The Jacksons are here to stay and we&rsquo;re going to try and achieve our goals sooner than anybody expects!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And just as a footnote, in case anyone wonders, yes, The Jacksons did have to deal with schooling during those years when they were continuously out on the road! In fact, Randy still spends three hours a day with a tutor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How is he able to learn as much as his counterparts who go to school every day? &ldquo;Remember there&rsquo;s one teacher for just one person!&rdquo; Point taken, Randy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons seem set for a future as bright as their past. They&rsquo;ve grown into five articulate and intelligent gentlemen whose talents are only about to be fully unleashed on the world! Look out world!</span></p></body>
