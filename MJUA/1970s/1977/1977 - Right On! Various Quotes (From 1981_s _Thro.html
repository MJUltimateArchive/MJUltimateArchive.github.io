I loved the film &lsquo;Bugsy Malone&rsquo; because it has only kids in it. I love photographing children &ndash; I could do it all day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Once you make a record or a film, once it&rsquo;s out there, it&rsquo;s done. It has to be good. I like the idea of doing &lsquo;The Wiz&rsquo; because it has the best people working in it. Anybody can act. I&rsquo;ve never really tried taking it seriously, but I can do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m different from most people my age because I&rsquo;ve seen so much and done so much. I was raised in this business. God created certain people to do certain things. My brothers and I were chosen to do this. We have talent.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even touched heroin or any drugs like that. I&rsquo;ve never even smoked pot. Never in my honest-to-God life. I don&rsquo;t even want to try. I&rsquo;ve been offered it, I&rsquo;ve been offered lots of stuff, but I&rsquo;m not interested. I&rsquo;m happy the way I am. If I want to feel free with my mind I&rsquo;ll go for a walk along, the beach, read a beautiful book, or write a song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sometimes I just want to take all the children of the world in my arms.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The Jacksons will just keep doing what people want to hear. Keeping it modern is the main thing. Everybody still likes dancing and singing. Long as you have the right material, you can entertain them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
