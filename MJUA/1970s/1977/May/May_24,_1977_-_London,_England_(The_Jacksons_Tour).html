		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">London, England (The Jacksons Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Record Mirror&quot; (July 2, 1977)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson wasn&rsquo;t too pleased when he heard that The Jacksons&#39; first single release on Epic, &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;, had barely scraped into the British Top 50. &quot;We&rsquo;re used to being Number One&rdquo;, he whispered in his usual manner, making it clear that even a Top 10 hit would not make him feel at home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was as if Michael&#39;s words had traveled on a heavenly route. For one can clearly see that The Jacksons are now Number One for the first time in more years than anyone cares to remember. The family reaction to this would be similar to a track runner taking first place. After breaking the finishing ribbon and catching a few breaths, it&#39;s imperative to look forward and keep running.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And looking ahead all the time, The Jacksons are finishing up a new album with Gamble and Huff in a Philadelphia studio. On the group&#39;s recent visit, Michael had a few rough tapes with him on one of those elaborate Japanese portable tape systems. Visitors to the Jackson suite in London&#39;s Intercontinental got a chance to have a preview of a few new songs. During moments of boredom, Michael and Marlon would put on the tapes and toy around with a few synchronized dance steps. But, in the end, it&#39;s Jackie who does the bulk of the actual staging.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sub-standard</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was only a month ago that The Jacksons arrived in this country to perform for the Royal Variety Show in Glasgow. Controversial RM scribe Sheila Prophet and I were on hand to welcome The Jacksons back after nearly five years and machine gun them with questions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Show You the Way to Go&quot; had only just been released as a single. The idea of it soaring to Number One seemed unexpected, but so was the Jacksons&#39; return to Britain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The family got on with the business at hand of seeing Loch Ness, doing interviews, and trying out a few recommended places to shop. The hysterics at their London concert have already been well chronicled. I was invited by their father to their London hotel for tea--and that ended up being a good part of the evening, including showing Michael around London at night and a visit to George Benson&#39;s post tour party.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joseph Jackson, the band&#39;s father and biggest influence, hinted heavily that what held them back in America for so long related to behind the scenes problems. A new record company and a different promoter from the last tour have made a big impression on Joseph. He is not surprised that the group have had few chart hits here in the last few years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was unhappy with Motown in the final days because so much material was recorded and so little was used. Promotion in America was substandard by what the Jacksons had been used to. Consequently, there wasn&#39;t a great deal you could expect from the label in other countries.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Freedom</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joseph and his sons repeatedly praised Gamble and Huff&#39;s setup for allowing them freedom in choosing and singing material. No longer is Michael Jackson taught to phrase a song line for line, the way he was when he was 12. In addition, The Jacksons record only enough material for each album. In this way, the public can look forward to some kind of progress with each album instead of wondering if a new album is merely leftover scraps from the last session.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After tea, Joseph Jackson departed to spend the last night in London with some old American acquaintances who were also in town. The boys were free to do what they wanted. Most of them had been out shopping. Randy had been out so long that tutor, Rose Fine, gave him his mandatory hours of schooling in the evening. Group costumes and effects are packed by staff, but each brother is responsible for his own case. As The Jacksons had all seen George Benson the previous night, there were no unified plans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael intended to stay in and pack. But he braided his afro into cornrows and prepared to shoot the breeze with Steven Manning, once the Jacksons&#39; US fan club president, and now one of their employees. Manning is based in New York, except when he tours with the group. Put Michael and Manning together and you have a contest of one-upmanship. Always eager to increase the playful atmosphere, Michael will lure you in by saying, &quot;Let me ask you something.&quot; The next thing you know, you&#39;re rapping and arguing like crazy. One of Michael&#39;s favorite forms of amusement is to get two people into a heated discussion about politics, race, or whatever, then sit back and let them give each other headaches.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Especially you guys from New York&quot;, he shook his head at Steve and myself. &quot;You don&#39;t shut up not a second.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We eventually got into a gossip swap, and from there a talk on department stores. When I showed off a pair of multicolored socks from a place in New York, Michael faked a faint from foot odor and then asked for the store&rsquo;s address.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, I better not&quot;, he realized. &quot;It&#39;ll just add to the rumors about me. Haven&rsquo;t you heard the rumor about me from Hollywood?&quot;, he scowled. &quot;They say I&#39;m having an affair with this TV actor. It&#39;s really terrible because there&#39;s nothing I can say or do to counter it. The more I deny it... well, you know. &quot;The gossip magazines out there are the worst. They are full of color pictures and all the ladies read them in the beauty parlors. They superimpose pictures together with unbelievable headlines.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Incest</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I once saw one about Cher having an affair with a woman. And they had her face to face with her own sister. If they had known that was her sister in the shot, I bet they would have written a piece about incest instead.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a strange way The Jacksons have fallen into an LA lifestyle with a casual attitude. It&#39;s not unusual to see Tito&#39;s wife, Dee Dee, racing up the freeway with a head full of rollers. Jackie drives a jeep, and Michael and Randy get a great buzz out of making home television commercials with their own video equipment. Groupies, to Michael, are the girls who succeed in climbing over the wall of their house and then get thrown out by the security guards. And the guards are the people he sneaks by to have a good night out. And when Michael has a good night out, he is smart enough to keep it to himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dennis, the owner of Oddbins the wine merchants, was my intended escort to the George Benson concert, but somehow between the fracas in Michael&#39;s hotel suite, we never got to the show. We exhausted all the controversial subjects and then realized that on his last night in London Michael had never seen Big Ben &quot;in person&quot;, as he put it. So, he dressed, put one of those familiar hats over his cornrows and we set out to discreetly sneak him out of the front door of the hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Devoted</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We nearly got him into Dennis&#39; car, save for six or seven devoted fans who nearly engraved Dennis&#39; windows with their pens. We drove around Buckingham Palace and St James&#39;. At Trafalgar Square, Michael jumped out of the open sunroof to get a better glimpse of the statues. Then down the Embankment, over one bridge to the Houses of Parliament, back over another bridge and around to the Tower of London. After that, we crashed the festivities in George Benson&#39;s honor. Marlon showed up later with a few of his friends. After the main course we left, for The Jacksons had to be up early.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Writers always switch their stuff around&quot;, he once kidded me about the purity of the music press. &quot;But fans who grew up with you will grow old with you. And that&#39;s the thing to remember. I know you&#39;ll write 50 stories yelling about what took us so long to get here. Why don&#39;t you just say that we&#39;re here now. That&#39;s what&#39;s important, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p></body>
