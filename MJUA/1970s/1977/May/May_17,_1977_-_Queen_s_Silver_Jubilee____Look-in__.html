We&rsquo;d done it five years ago for her mother, but this time it was for her and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. They asked us and we were honored to do it. Afterwards she came backstage and she said, &ldquo;Did you just come here to perform for [me]?&rdquo; And we said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Where do you go next?&rdquo; We said, &ldquo;London.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Are you all brothers?&rdquo; And we said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And she said our show was very enjoyable. Her husband was very interested&mdash;he must have spent five minutes asking us if our parents were musically inclined: what did they play, what did my mother play? My mother played the clarinet in a band, and my father was in a singing group called the Falcons&mdash;they were a local group. The Queen had her crown on and a pink dress with all these pearls and rubies and diamonds all over it. She wears a lot of jewelry. The producers and the people from the [Silver] Jubilee told us that [the Queen] did something at our show that they never saw her do&mdash;she actually clapped to the music and kept time and nodded her head in keeping the time. We were really happy to hear that; that&rsquo;s really different and I was glad.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Moonwalk&rdquo; autobiography (February 1, 1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We had three years of hits behind us when we toured Europe that first time, so there was enough to please both the kids who followed our music and the Queen of England, whom we met at a Royal Command Performance. That was very exciting for us. I had seen photographs of other groups, like the Beatles, meeting the Queen after command performances, but I never dreamed we&rsquo;d get the chance to play for her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Look-in&rdquo; magazine (July 23, 1977), From Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Along with the rest of his brothers Michael spoke with Look-In reporter Gerry Fallon when they visited for their appearance in Glasgow before HM Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh at the Royal Command Performance, as part of the Queen&rsquo;s Silver Jubilee celebrations in May 1977.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was their first appearance in the Britain since November, 1972 and they were now known as The Jacksons, having left Jermaine behind at Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The fans however, had not forgotten them as Michael was quick to acknowledge.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The fans were great to us.
