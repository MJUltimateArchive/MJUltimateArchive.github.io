So far, The Spinners have left Motown and have had a great success; Gladys Knight and The Pips have left Motown and have had a great success; Martha Reeves has left Motown and has granted interviews. Motown producers like Lamont Dozier have left Motown; the management of Motown has left Motown (that is, Detroit); and there is no longer any trace in popular music of Motown&rsquo;s regional idiosyncrasy or much evidence of the company&rsquo;s former musical hegemony. Diana Ross, The Temptations, and The Miracles (all of whom remain on the label) have for the record-buying public an interest that is at least partly reminiscent; only Stevie Wonder and The Jackson Five, the last classic Motown act to develop, have continued with undiminished vitality, and last week, in an atmosphere that was&mdash;well, businesslike, the Jackson family announced that they had signed a contract with Epic Records (a subsidiary of CBS) and would leave Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson family announced their decision to leave Motown at a press conference in the Rainbow Grill. For the conference, ten high-backed black chairs were arranged behind a long, narrow table on a dais; dozens of other high-backed black chairs were arranged to face the dais. Taken one by one, the black chairs resembled the chairs found in medium-priced dinette sets; massed together, they lent the room a sober quality such as one might find at the United Nations&mdash;at meetings of, say, the Trusteeship Council. Susan Blond, who works for Epic, selected the music that played while the press assembled. &ldquo;I put on three Jackson Five, three LaBelle, three Jackson Five, three Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes&mdash;like that,&rdquo; she told us as we sat in one of the high-backed black chairs. &ldquo;I can tell this is a Jackson Five song playing now, because I know it isn&rsquo;t LaBelle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eleven members of the Jackson family entered the Rainbow Grill and mounted the dais. Ten members of the Jackson family sat in the black highbacked chairs. One member of the Jackson family, Stacy, sat in the lap of her mother, Maureen, the oldest Jackson daughter. At the end of the dais, stage right, sat Joe Jackson, father of the family and manager of the group. He was dressed in a slick black suit. Ranged down the table were Jackie (green jacket, twenty-four years old), Tito (brown jacket, twenty-one years old), Marlon (white leisure jacket, seventeen years old), and Michael (black velvet jacket, plaid vest, sixteen years old). Not present was Jermaine Jackson (twenty years old), who is married to Hazel Joy Gordy (daughter of Berry Gordy, chairman of the board of Motown Records), and who has not yet decided to leave Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There are a lot of little ones,&rdquo; Susan Blond remarked to us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;But do they make up for Jermaine?&rdquo; asked a young woman behind us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A reporter asked the Jackson family why they had decided to leave Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We left Motown because we look forward to selling a lot of albums,&rdquo; Tito Jackson answered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Motown sells a lot of singles. Epic sells a lot of albums,&rdquo; Mr. Jackson added.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A reporter asked Michael Jackson, who is really the star of the group, how he thought the move would affect him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;m sure the promotion will be stronger,&rdquo; Michael Jackson said. A reporter asked Mr. Jackson how the move would affect the Jacksons&rsquo; relationship with Berry Gordy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Jackson smiled. &ldquo;You take it as it comes,&rdquo; he sald.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tito and Jackie Jackson looked as self-confident as their father, although they didn&rsquo;t manage to be quite as elusive. Michael looked very shy. Stacy, in her mother&rsquo;s lap, put her face in a glass of ice water. Mr. Jackson said he was very happy to be at CBS, because &ldquo;everything is possible&rdquo; at CBS. Michael Jackson said he thought the family would be going after an older audience and might, in their Las Vegas show, do some nostalgia, &ldquo;so the older people can remember their younger days.&rdquo; Mr. Jackson said he was confident that Jermaine would rejoin the group. &ldquo;Under his conditions, it&rsquo;ll take a while,&rdquo; Mr. Jackson said. No Jackson said anything sentimental. No Jackson said anything to indicate that there had been anything in the Motown ethic which couldn&rsquo;t be reproduced at will at CBS. No Jackson really explained why their contract with CBS is being announced now, even though they remain under contract to Motown until March, 1976.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A reporter did ask if the Jacksons had tried to renegotiate their contract with Motown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sure we tried to renegotiate with Motown,&rdquo; Jackie said, &ldquo;but the figures were just Mickey Mouse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Do you know that show &lsquo;The Jeffersons&rsquo;?&rdquo; the young woman behind us said. &ldquo;About the upwardly mobile black man who owns some dry-cleaning store? Well, Mr. Jackson is Mr. Jefferson, and the children are his dry-cleaning stores...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frederick L. Douglass, &ldquo;For The Record&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jackson 5 Leaving Motown&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After selling millions of records on the Motown label, The Jackson Five will soon become the hottest thing on the Epic label, a subsidiary of the Columbia Broadcasting System. During a press conference recently held 65 stories above the ground in the Rainbow Room of New York City&#39;s RCA Building.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Reacting to a question as to whether Jermaine Jackson will leave the Motown label and join the rest of his family, Michael Jackson responded, &quot;Jermaine is still undecided as to what he wants to do... he has some very personal reasons for wanting to stay with Motown, but I&#39;m confident that we will remain together as a group and that he will soon be joining us... however, he&#39;s a man and has the right to do what he wants to do... as for the rest of us, we&#39;ve got work to do... we&#39;re still developing as a group, we&#39;re trying to fully develop our writing skills... we have our own publishing company which is called &quot;[illegible] On&quot; and we really want to expand our repertoire of original material... we have a lot of plans for the group and it will take a lot of hard work to make these plans become real.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson emphatically denied the rumor that CBS eventually plans to get rid of the other family members and to promote him as a single recording star by stating, &quot;The Jackson 5 is a family affair and we plan to keep it that way... we&#39;ve come a long way as a family group under the management of our father Joe Jackson... we feel that the family approach is the best thing for us... like my father stated earlier, we will be making some individual recordings, but we would strongly resist any efforts to break us up as a group... in fact, our contract with CBS will specifically list each member of the group and the financial benefits that each one of us will be receiving... like I said before, The Jackson 5 is a family affair.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the time came to sign the CBS contracts that were lying on his father&rsquo;s bed, [Jermaine] refused. At the press conference when asked about Jermaine&rsquo;s absence the brothers said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Jermaine has to think things out for a while, but he&rsquo;ll be back with us very shortly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Upon the reason to leave Motown Tito said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We first tried to re-negotiate with Motown. But they just offered us a Mickey Mouse contract.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When asked how much the CBS contract was worth father Joe responded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well, let me put it this way: It&rsquo;s somewhere between one dollar and 30 million!!!&rdquo;</span></p></body>
