He was, by then,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">sixteen, but it&rsquo;s possible I still thought he was fourteen. He was self-conscious about his</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">acne, and admitted that his brothers teased him about it. We talked about Dancing</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Machine, the first album that Motown had allowed the brothers to produce themselves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I got to sing free,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;It was the first time I got to do my own thing. Our</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">persistence in continually telling the record company we didn&rsquo;t want other writers, was what finally changed their mind. You&rsquo;ve got to remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been around</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">studios since I was a child, and I just picked it up.&rdquo; He talked about Stevie Wonder; he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">admired him because he was always able to &ldquo;sing free&rdquo; and insisted on recording where</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">he wanted to record, rather than the Motown studios. &ldquo;Only a producer-singer knows</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; Michael said, &ldquo;because he sings also. When you&rsquo;re being told what to</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">do, it&rsquo;s not free.&rdquo; What had he previously been told to do? &ldquo;Sing this word this way, this</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">line this way, go up and down like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not being &lsquo;you,&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">trying to get the &lsquo;you&rsquo; out. Like Gladys Knight; she sings freely and look how great she</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">is.&rdquo; He talked about the Jacksons&rsquo; concerts and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">do anything we want to do onstage. We really would like to do something like Emerson,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lake and Palmer or some of those rock groups do--like when the piano turns around in</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the air. We have lots of ideas like that and we intend to do them in future shows.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once again I asked him what he did in his &ldquo;spare&rdquo; time. He said because they</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">traveled so much for their shows, he liked to stay at home and read. &ldquo;The dictionary,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">adventure books, all sorts of things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had four weeks off and stayed home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He told me he hated parties, unless it was a party where you could just talk. &ldquo;And when</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">there are other entertainers there, it&rsquo;s even better.&rdquo; We talked about whether or not he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">could go out to concerts, and he said whenever he went out, there was always a</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">problem. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the only way you can really tell what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said he always wanted to work with Barbra Streisand, and that he wrote a ballad he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">thought would be perfect for her. &ldquo;Ballads are more special,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can have a</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">pop song that will be known for three weeks and after that you hear nothing about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But if you do a good ballad, it&rsquo;ll be in the world forever. Like Stevie&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living in the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">City&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s a great song and I love it, it opens up the minds of a lot of people. But it</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">won&rsquo;t be around as long as a song like &lsquo;My Cherie Amour&rsquo; or &lsquo;You Are the Sunshine of</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My Life.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/09/michael-jackson200909"><span class="cs8567212B">Vanity Fair (September 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Warwick Hotel, New York City, February 5, 1975: The entire Jackson family is in town for the Jackson Five&rsquo;s concert at Radio City Music Hall. Michael is alternately fun and his usual outgoing self and more quiet, thoughtful. His skin has broken out; he confides to me that his brothers have been teasing him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/I7fokSWHq3M"><span class="cs8567212B">Interview tape</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (3:10 - 4:10), transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I got to sing free, the way I wanted to sing it. I wasn&rsquo;t told what to do. And it came out fabulous, everybody likes it&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do my own thing, and it&rsquo;s the first time, like on [sings] &ldquo;just one more step&rdquo; and all that stuff, and One Day in Your Life&hellip; I had to put up a couple of little fusses, but-</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Robinson</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Really?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Just a little.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">LR</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Well, do you think now that they&rsquo;re paying more attention to you, they don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a kid anymore or something, and you&rsquo;ll be able to do more of that kind of stuff?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ</span><span class="csD5D7D290">:</span><span class="cs31D24DEE"> </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, I always still wanted to do - be free all the time, but nobody would ever listen. Now they see I know what sounds good. It always comes out good.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">What was different for you on this latest album [</span><span class="csD5D7D290">Dancing Machine</span><span class="cs43C038A">]?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I got to sing free. For the first time I got to do my own thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">What do you mean &ldquo;free&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, when you&rsquo;re being told, it&rsquo;s not you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">What were you being told?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Told to sing this word this way, this line this way, go up and down, and this and that. It&rsquo;s not being &ldquo;you.&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re trying to get the &ldquo;you&rdquo; out. Like Gladys Knight&mdash;she sings freely and look how great she is and that&rsquo;s the best way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">And how was it working with Stevie Wonder?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was really fun because he lets you sing freely. Only a singer and a producer-singer knows what he&rsquo;s doing, because he sings also.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Have you been going out lately?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No . . . I like staying home, just under the fireplace, reading . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">What sort of things are you reading?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> All kinds of things . . . the dictionary, adventure books. I had four weeks off and I just stayed home. I don&rsquo;t really like going to parties . . . Well, I like parties where you can talk&mdash;a fireplace and a piano, and when there&rsquo;s entertainers [there] it&rsquo;s even better. You go to a lot of concerts, don&rsquo;t you? You get in for free? What was the last concert you went to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Led Zeppelin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Good concert?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Yes. Loud. Rock. You don&rsquo;t get a chance to go to many? You don&rsquo;t want to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I want to, but whenever I go out, there&rsquo;s always problems. But that&rsquo;s how you could tell what [else is] happening.</span></p></body>
