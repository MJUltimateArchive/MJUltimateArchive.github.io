		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">New York City, New York (The Jackson 5 World Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">New York Amsterdam News (February 15, 1975) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://j5collector.blogspot.com/2010/06/rare-lukewarm-review.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The flurry and fury attributed to an anticipated Jackson 5 appearance and their initial approach to the stage at Radio City Music Hall came as no surprise, for the J-5 have created tremors on the national and international music scene for years. The group was almost inaudible in their first few songs, due to the screams and shouts that filled the Hall.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tempo began to diminish as the J-5 got into the &quot;history of groups&quot;, with great interpretations of the Andrew Sisters, The Mills Brothers, The Coasters, and Four Freshmen. The multi-colored suits, running lights, and orchestra was not enough to sustain the ebullience which preceded their vaudeville act.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">True, there were shouts of approval from the older element of the audience when the J-5 did the &quot;history of groups&quot;, uproarious laughter as 13-year old Randy and 8-year old Janet Jackson did their Jeanette MacDonald,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nelson Eddy, Mickey &amp; Sylvia, and Sonny &amp; Cher routine and amazement as the J-5 danced their slick tap sequence along with sister LaToya in their blue tails, but that electricity which usually generated throughout a J-5 show was missing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A beautifully Interwoven medley of &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;, &quot;By the Time I Get To Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Danny Boy&quot; showed another shade of the 30-million word sellers. The vibrations got much stronger of course, when the Jackson 5 plus 1 did &quot;Whatever You Got I Want&quot;, &quot;Dancing Machine&quot;, &quot;I Am Love&quot;,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the oldies but goodies like &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Never Can Say Goodbye&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot;, and that which started it all, &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The J-5&#39;s performance opening night at Radio City Music Hall was obviously entertaining, polished and professional, but left much to be desired in the eyes of the younger set and those who grew up with them. There was also a somewhat dismal look on those parents&#39; faces who had relinquished $10 for tickets in these inflationary times to treat their cherished children to a rare J-5 New York appearance, only to watch a perplexed, instead of a joyous countenance take hold of their kids as the J-5 went through a bygone era and a Vegas act that should have been left in Las Vegas or saved for a TV special. The prominent performer who assumes the title of &quot;the hardest working man in show business&quot; may have to vie for that title with &quot;Blue Magic&quot;, the gentlemen sharing the bill with the J-5. In the absence of elaborate stage props, these 5 musical wizards continue to take command of their eager and willing audiences. If the quintet keeps on dazzling their audiences with their style and singing, the term &quot;black magic&quot; will become oblivious to the English language and replaced by &quot;blue magic&quot;. The &quot;Magic of the Blue&quot; sang the hits, &quot;Stop To Start.&quot;, &quot;Sideshow,&quot;, &quot;Just Don&#39;t Want To Be Lonely&quot;, et al.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The opening act, &quot;The Hues Corporation&quot; bumped and romped their way through their 3-million seller, &quot;Rock The Boat&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#39; Soul&quot;, &quot;Papa Was A Rolling Stone&quot;, and at a slower pace, &quot;Freedom for the Stallion&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The evening ended up at the Warwick Hotel at a party for the J-5. In attendance were members of &quot;Blue Magic&quot;, Atlantic Records&#39; artists&#39; relations director, Barbara Harris, Clifton Davis, members of Aretha Franklin&#39;s family and other well wishers who greeted the whole Jackson 5 family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/06/26/from-the-voice-archives-vince-aletti-backstage-with-the-jackson-five-in-1975/"><span class="cs8567212B">Voice (February 17, 1975)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five (&ldquo;and Family&rdquo;) came to New York to put their &ldquo;Special Las Vegas Show&rdquo; into Radio City Music Hall for a week and I met them in a hotel room the day before it started [February 6, 1975] to find out what that meant. Jackie, who has a disconcertingly high, thin voice, and, at 23, is the oldest of the brothers, told me: &ldquo;A Vegas show is a show that you play in front of an audience of people who have different ages&ndash;from the fifties on down&ndash;you know, all ages. So you have to satisfy all those people: you do a little of everything to get &rsquo;em on their feet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;A little of everything&rdquo; turned out to be: take-offs on the Andrews Sisters, the Mills Brothers, the Supremes, Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, and Sonny and Cher; ensemble tap dancing; scripted between-songs patter; &ldquo;Danny Boy,&rdquo; &ldquo;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&rdquo; and &ldquo;Killing Me Softly&rdquo; &ndash; a medley of solos performed on stools; strobe lights; a mirrored ball; one costume change; a medley of their earliest hits (&ldquo;I Want You Back,&rdquo; &ldquo;ABC,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Love You Save&rdquo;) and half the songs from their latest album. They&rsquo;re proud of their Vegas show, not just because of its slick, television-special professionalism, but because it means they&rsquo;ve achieved a certain kind of show biz security: &ldquo;Like Frank Sinatra,&rdquo; according to Jackie. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t have to put out a hit record, he can still go to Las Vegas and pack &rsquo;em in.&rdquo; These five little rich boys are already thinking about the day the screaming stops; and when they&rsquo;re too old for the color centerfolds and &ldquo;Right On!&rdquo; magazine, they can always fall back on the bouffant-wig and sharkskin-suit crowd in Vegas and Lake Tahoe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But though they&rsquo;re obviously concerned with their post-pin-up careers, I&rsquo;m really more interested in why Jermaine has his hair straightened, where they pick up their dance steps and why they&rsquo;re all wearing these awful patent-finish loafers with flat heels. And while they&rsquo;re answering cover questions about producers and new albums, I take notes on their clothes (Jermaine&ndash;wide-brimmed black hat with red band, custom jeans with rhinestone studs; Marlon&ndash;a T-shirt with a Mickey and Minnie Mouse design; Michael&ndash;a dark green vested Pierre Cardin suit without the coat, cream yellow shirt, white patent shoes). Being in love with the Jackson Five means getting beyond the pin-ups&ndash;getting past an obsession with style to an appreciation of content&ndash;but it doesn&rsquo;t mean putting the pin-ups aside. In this case, it means being a fan first, then a critic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I was much more dismayed by their apparent lack of personal flair when it comes to clothes than I was by &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; or any of their dumb stage-dialogue routines (at least they didn&rsquo;t announce their signs). And, on the other hand, more surprisingly soft, unaggressive, and warm, with Jermaine&rsquo;s sometimes verging on a self-conscious stutter) than by their singing, even if it is getting better all the time. I&rsquo;m torn between writing a fan letter (Dear Jermaine: Ever since a Hollywood friend told me he saw you eating all alone in an Italian restaurant . . . ) and a critical analysis. But I&rsquo;m more concerned that I didn&rsquo;t get their autographs than that I can&rsquo;t read any of my notes on their Radio City concert.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the Jackson Five first appeared with &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; a little more than five years ago, their impact was stunning. Motown Records and the music business as a whole were in the midst of a serious energy crisis; everything was sounding unbearably flat and tired. The J5 took over like a tough, loud street gang&ndash;but, of course, a perfectly polite and presentable one. There was nothing else of comparable drive or energy on the radio, nothing else to scream along to, nothing else to care about. It was amusing that they were &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; and &ldquo;presented by&rdquo; Diana Ross (even more amusing when it turned out later that Gladys Knight had seen them first but wasn&rsquo;t considered enough of a &ldquo;name&rdquo; at Motown to lend prestige to a new act) but it was more important that they were all so damn cute (had they been boys with weight problems and thick glasses, no matter how talented, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten past two talent nights at the Apollo). They were the songs of a singer-turned-crane-operator with four other children and they lived in the hard steel town of Gary, Indiana and that made a good story. But no one was surprised when, several years and many gold records later they moved to Encino, California, and a house with a pool and a sunken living room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I saw the Jackson Five on stage for the first time a year or two after &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo;&ndash;saw them from the 4th row in the orchestra of Madison Square Garden, standing on my seat with little girls climbing on the arm rests, darting through the row and clogging the aisles, screaming all the time, trying to get closer. I just stayed where I was and screamed too. They were impossibly good and they&rsquo;ve remained that way: tight, sharp, seemingly effortless vocals; perfect stage costumes and dance steps at once so stylized and so natural that they were thrilling. But while their stage shows were still among the very best in the business, their recordings started getting rather limp. They put out the best Christmas album since Phil Spector&rsquo;s Phillies&rsquo; package, Michael recorded three solo albums and a moving love song to a rat (&ldquo;Ben&rdquo;), Jermaine and Jackie each put out solo albums (Jermaine&rsquo;s singing on his first was not quite as interesting as the shirtless-on-the-beach picture of him inside the cover) and I continued to collect pin-ups. About three years ago, through the Jackson Five&rsquo;s music began fading back into the aural wallpaper.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Motown acts have an amazing resiliency, and in the fall of 1973, the Jackson Five shot back with a single and an album titled &ldquo;Get It Together,&rdquo; produced by Hal Davis, who&rsquo;d worked with them on and off since the beginning. Davis drew heavily on the techniques and material of Normal Whitefield, the producer who revitalized the Temptations, packing his arrangements with electronic squiggles, synthesizer effects, hard chunky drumming, echoed voices, wah-wah guitars, and the short of sharp-edged changes that make dancers scream. It took a while for people who always thought the Jackson Five were just kid stuff (they were never just kid stuff) to catch on, but when the album was released last year, it become one of 1974s most successful r&amp;b records and turned a lot of heads around.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the group&rsquo;s Vegas Show at Radio City was a weirdly schizophrenic mix of new discotheque-styled material from the &ldquo;GIT&rdquo; turning-point album and its follow-up, &ldquo;Dancing Machine,&rdquo; with variety-show medleys of what people like to call &ldquo;standards.&rdquo; Clearly the audience, not exactly a Vegas crowd, didn&rsquo;t know quite what to make of it and didn&rsquo;t much care&ndash;they were there to jump and shout and you couldn&rsquo;t do either (unless the shout was &ldquo;Bullshit!&rdquo;) to the History of Music medley, no matter how cleverly designed and executed, or the thoughtful-solos-on-stools segment. Both sections were dropped from the show following their cool reception on opening night; as Aretha Franklin discovered last year, after a much greater miscalculation (that clown outfit! Those dancers! &ldquo;MacArthur Park&rdquo;! oh please), Radio City is not, or not yet, Las Vegas. But the tap dancing was kept in&ndash;they were so good they might rescue tap from the outer reaches of camp all by themselves&ndash;as was a particularly bizarre routine featuring Randy, 13, who has been performing with the group as a surprisingly strong conga player, and Janet, 8, the family&rsquo;s youngest girl. Performing love duets in different styles&ndash;from Sonny &amp; Cher to Mickey &amp; Sylvia&ndash;and dressed like nightclub entertainers (Jan in a long, backless white satin gown and a feather boa that she flaunted with startling precocity), they looked more like midgets than children, for the moment more loveable than electrifying. But the others were, as always, remarkably slick without being slimy&ndash;a rather thin line when you&rsquo;re dressed in various pastel shades and have to smile a lot. The high point for them all: &ldquo;I Am Love,&rdquo; with a strobe-lit dancing transition from Jermaine&rsquo;s slow introduction into a hard-pounding finish featuring Tito&rsquo;s Motown-psychedelic guitar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But no matter how much I love the others, it is Michael who is the group&rsquo;s aesthetic focus. His stylized show-biz posing (the bends and turns arm out-stretched and sweeping the air in front of him; little self-hugs with his head thrown back) is becoming a little disturbing, at moments even grotesque for a boy who&rsquo;s still a very skinny sixteen. But when he isn&rsquo;t being Engelbert Huperdinck, he&rsquo;s supreme and so controlled it&rsquo;s almost frightening. In his hotel room, when he tells you he&rsquo;s in eleventh grade, it might seem strange but it&rsquo;s believable; seeing him on stage, dancing and striding confidently out to the edge (where a girl in a leopard-print cost springs up and gives him a note), you just know he had to be lying. I want to be Michael Jackson when I grow up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the first night at Radio City Music Hall, The group decided to omit the &lsquo;History of Music&rsquo; segment and the medley, &lsquo;Killing Me Softly With His Song/By The Time I Get To Phoenix / Danny Boy&rsquo; from the show. The reaction was rather lukewarm and not received as well as they thought.</span></p></body>
