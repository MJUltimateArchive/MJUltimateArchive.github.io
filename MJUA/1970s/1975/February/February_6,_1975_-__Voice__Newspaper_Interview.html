Jackie, who has a disconcertingly high, thin voice, and, at 23, is the oldest of the brothers, told me: &ldquo;A Vegas show is a show that you play in front of an audience of people who have different ages&ndash;from the fifties on down&ndash;you know, all ages. So you have to satisfy all those people: you do a little of everything to get &rsquo;em on their feet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip; They&rsquo;re proud of their Vegas show, not just because of its slick, television-special professionalism, but because it means they&rsquo;ve achieved a certain kind of show biz security: &ldquo;Like Frank Sinatra,&rdquo; according to Jackie. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t have to put out a hit record, he can still go to Las Vegas and pack &rsquo;em in.&rdquo; These five little rich boys are already thinking about the day the screaming stops; and when they&rsquo;re too old for the color centerfolds and &ldquo;Right On!&rdquo; magazine, they can always fall back on the bouffant-wig and sharkskin-suit crowd in Vegas and Lake Tahoe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;But no matter how much I love the others, it is Michael who is the group&rsquo;s aesthetic focus. His stylized show-biz posing (the bends and turns arm out-stretched and sweeping the air in front of him; little self-hugs with his head thrown back) is becoming a little disturbing, at moments even grotesque for a boy who&rsquo;s still a very skinny sixteen. But when he isn&rsquo;t being Engelbert Huperdinck, he&rsquo;s supreme and so controlled it&rsquo;s almost frightening. In his hotel room, when he tells you he&rsquo;s in eleventh grade, it might seem strange but it&rsquo;s believable; seeing him on stage, dancing and striding confidently out to the edge (where a girl in a leopard-print cost springs up and gives him a note), you just know he had to be lying. I want to be Michael Jackson when I grow up.</span></p></body>
