Funnily enough the world&#39;s second largest hotel, the MGM Grand, is just a couple of blocks down the road. It&#39;s here for the next couple of weeks The Jackson 5 can be found playing to hordes of middle-aged Americans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Las Vegas is of course one of the few towns in America where gambling is legal, consequently over the years it&#39;s become virtually the casino center of the universe. Last year more than one billion dollars was lost there in bets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Losing money in such large quantities can be a painful experience, which is where The Jackson 5 come in. Every night they and a host of other glittering names like Paul Anka and Engelbert Humperdinck proffer cabaret-style entertainment to console the mass of (usually) unsuccessful gamblers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last week shortly before the Jacksons were due to go on for the nightly stint we managed to catch a few words with Michael, Marlon, Tito, and Randy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Was it out imagination or was this quartet of Jacksons looking ever so slightly bored with the Nevada casino life-style?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael answers: &quot;We like playing Vegas, because the audience are so good. But, as far as the town&#39;s concerned, if you&#39;re not a gambler there&#39;s nothing much you can do&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearing in mind the unusually high age group the lads are playing to, the band seem to have adjusted quite well. Naturally the Las Vegas concert-goers are quite different from the Jacksons&#39; usual teenybop audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Being so much older they don&#39;t scream at all. They still recognize the hits when we play them, you can tell that by the way they applaud. But if they like your act instead of screaming they give you a standing ovation at the end, To be honest we don&#39;t miss the screaming. There&#39;s not much you can do when the audience is making a lot of noise, because you can&#39;t really hear what you&#39;re playing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Maybe they&#39;d rather have no screams at all?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Randy disagrees: &quot;I like it when the fans scream because when they&#39;re really screaming it makes you want to play better&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...A hasty piece of mental arithmetic reveals that there must now be three bachelor Jacksons. One wonders who is going to be the next to wed. None of the three appear to want to commit themselves. Michael says it won&#39;t be him, Randy says it can&#39;t possibly be him, and Marlon says nothing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When pressed to talk about their current girlfriends they all deny that they have any. Eventually Michael explains: &quot;I have no girlfriends. Of course I intend to get married. Everybody does, but that&#39;s probably going to be when I&#39;m 30&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon adds: &quot;He&#39;s too busy in his work to think of girls&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Somehow the way they answer these questions isn&#39;t too convincing. One feels their denials could just possibly be terminological inexactitudes of the truth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However let us not dwell on these trivial matters, but turn to more important issues, like for instance, their recent association with that Motown legend Stevie Wonder. Michael tells all, &quot;We&#39;ve done a couple of songs with Stevie as producer and later we intend to release a whole album with him. He&#39;s really an excellent produce. He lets you sing free.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BACKGROUND</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We also sang in the background on one track in his current album, called &quot;You Haven&#39;t Done Nothin&#39;&quot;. What happened was he was going to record us that day, but one of us didn&#39;t turn up, so he said can you do some background vocals for me instead.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;s a very interesting person to speak to. He told us a lot of things about Motown in the early days. Like for instance he told us about the rumor that he was discovered singing on a street corner and shaking his head. Of course it&#39;s not true&quot;.</span></p></body>
