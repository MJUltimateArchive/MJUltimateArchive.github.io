You make it up. And that&#39;s exactly what happened with the group. We made up. I mean, we tried to dance better, and sing as well, and play as well. I remember the day that Jermaine left group, we had a concert, the first show he didn&#39;t do with us, and we were--well, the audience liked the show. I remember it was in New York, and it was a theatre in the round, and we must&#39;ve got six standing ovations. We really did. The audience--I think that was one of our best shows, the day that Jermaine wasn&#39;t--I&#39;m not saying because he wasn&#39;t there, it&#39;s just how much more energy we put into the show.

They really wanted me to go with the group, because they didn&rsquo;t know if my leaving would change their whole thing or not. It didn&rsquo;t, because Randy just replaced me.</span></p></body>
