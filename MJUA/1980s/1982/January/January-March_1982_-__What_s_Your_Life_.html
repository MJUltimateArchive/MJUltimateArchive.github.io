		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What&#39;s Your Life?&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that Jermaine mentions that Michael bought the llama Louie after this encounter, and Michael bought Louie in Early April 1982.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jermaine Jackson, &ldquo;You Are Not Alone Michael -- Through a Brother&rsquo;s Eyes&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One day, Michael decided he wanted a llama. He asked me to take him to nearby Agora and we ended up at this lot packed with hay and horse trailers. From the car, we eyed four llamas out back. I parked between two trailers, unintentionally shielding my Mercedes from view. It was the only parking spot available. When we walked into the office&mdash;two kids dressed casual but smart in T-shirt and jeans&mdash;this guy, bent across a counter doing some paperwork, didn&rsquo;t even look up when he said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hiring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t looking for no job,&rdquo; said Michael, wearing his shades. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to buy a llama.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The man looked up. Not a flicker of recognition on his face. It took me about two seconds to know that his musical taste ventured nowhere the Thriller album. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any llamas,&rdquo; he said. The look on his face said it all: you can&rsquo;t afford it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You have four of them out back,&rdquo; I said, trying to keep calm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You know how much they cost?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael smiled. &ldquo;We know how much they cost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then came an incredible bombardment of questions, fired by the man&rsquo;s prejudices and assumptions. &ldquo;Can you afford a llama? What do you boys do to afford a llama? Where will you keep it? Have you thought about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ever patient, Michael explained that we had a house with grounds and were serious customers. &ldquo;I know how to look after all kinds of animals,&rdquo; he added.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The man begrudgingly asked to see some ID. Michael handed over a bank card. I handed over my driving license. And then night became day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re those Jackson boys?&rdquo; said the man, his face lighting up. He began to back-pedal about how he had to be careful and he couldn&rsquo;t sell to just anyone; you understand how it is. But we didn&rsquo;t understand: we saw right through him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re happy to accept me because you now know who I am?&rdquo; Michael asked. The biggest misconception people had about my brother was that his legendary shyness made him timid, but he was a man of principle, especially where his roots as a proud black man were concerned and he wasn&rsquo;t afraid to speak up on this when he was riled. Michael took back his ID and came right out with it: &ldquo;You are an ass, and we don&rsquo;t want to spend our money in here any more.&rdquo; Then we walked out to the Mercedes the man had failed to spot when we arrived.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the drive home, Michael was exasperated. &ldquo;Can you believe that? What is this area about? What are they teaching their kids?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We had always been told by our parents that no one is born with a prejudice. It is something that is taught, ignorance passed down from generation to generation. The more Michael brooded, the more fired up he became. He told me to drive to Tito&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That afternoon, Tito&rsquo;s acoustic guitar and our free-styling lyrics captured an angry inspiration for a song we called &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Your Life?.&rdquo; That was how Michael liked to work. When a true experience inspired a song, he liked to get it down on his tape recorder or in the nearest studio. We recorded that song within an hour at Tito&rsquo;s studio, also in Encino. It went like this:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First verse:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All my life I&rsquo;ve been asked such questions</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As who I am and what I do</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I tell them, they are happy</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&rsquo;Cause I am rich, it gets me through</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If I were a poor boy, would they accept me</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Am I rich? What&rsquo;s it to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And what&rsquo;s your reason for asking?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Is my life one big interview?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The hook:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&rsquo;s your life? What you do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I do this, how &rsquo;bout you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&rsquo;s your goal in life &rsquo;cause</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I want tips, to get through</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Are you rich? Are you poor?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Are you bold? Are you sure?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Will you bend, do you break?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Are you strong, to endure?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&rsquo;s your life? . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those lyrics sum up the conversation we shared in the car.</span></p></body>
