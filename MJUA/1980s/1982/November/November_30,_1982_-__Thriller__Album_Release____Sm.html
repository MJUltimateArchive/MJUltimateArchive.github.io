He had a great sound system in his car. We would sit in the car and we would listen to the album from front to back.

At the other end, live from Los Angeles, is an even younger Michael Jackson, whose new LP &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; has just been released. Their 35-minute conversation has gone down in history as Michael&rsquo;s last-ever British interview. Now, 25 years later, we reprint their classic exchange in full.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark Ellen:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Your new LP &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;, is out in Britain. Are you pleased with it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;s out already?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;ve got a copy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> In the stores?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it&rsquo;s about to be. Are you pleased with it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, yeah, I&rsquo;m pleased with it. I&rsquo;m hap&hellip; I&rsquo;m the kind of person that is never satisfied.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Which are your favourite tracks?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> My favourite tracks are &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;, um, &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo;, &ldquo;Starting Something&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Lady In My Life&rdquo;. Stuff like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There&rsquo;s all sorts of extraordinary people on it, Vincent Price, for instance. How come you worked with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;ve known Vincent ever since I was 11 years old. And when you think of &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;&hellip; I mean who&rsquo;s the king of horror who&rsquo;s still alive? I mean Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre are dead now and the only giant who goes back to those days is Vincent Price so I thought he was the perfect voice. Actually it was Rod Temperton and Quincy (Jones) who actually thought of him &lsquo;cause he is a friend and everything. He came in right away, it was no problem.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How about Eddie Van Halen?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I wrote a song called &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; and we wanted a great solo, a guitar solo, so that night Quincy said, I have a great idea, um, um, you know, someone like Van Halen would be a good idea or Peter Townshend but Townshend and The Who are touring at the moment so we thought it would be a problem. So the next day, the very next day, Eddie was in the studio. He&rsquo;s the kind of guy that kept worrying that his part was OK and he wanted to be just right. He&rsquo;s a perfectionist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How do you choose the songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Whatever&rsquo;s the best. Whatever&rsquo;s the best for today&rsquo;s sound and today&rsquo;s market. If it touches us personally we go ahead with it. And if I personally like it and Quincy personally likes it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What qualities do you look for in the songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I just look for the music to be outstanding and especially, more than anything, the melody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who offered you songs that you didn&rsquo;t accept? I heard there was one by Stevie Wonder?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, Stevie had one which was good. It was a good song, more a danceable-type thing. There was also&hellip; ah, what&rsquo;s his name?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> David Grant?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I forget (laughs). There&rsquo;s so much going on I forget. Steve is incredible. We went with a more danceable one but the song was great.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why did you choose the title &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;? You like movies a lot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I love movies. All movies. But I don&rsquo;t like scary movies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why not?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I can&rsquo;t sleep after watching one, it just scares me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What are your favorite movies?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Any Steven Spielberg movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you like E.T.?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I love E.T.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why do you love it so much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &lsquo;Cause it reminds me of me. The whole story, you know, someone from another world coming down and you becoming friends with them and this person&rsquo;s like 800 years old and he&rsquo;s filling you with all kinds of wisdom and he&rsquo;s magic and he can teach you how to fly. It&rsquo;s that whole fantasy thing that I think is great. I mean who doesn&#39;t want to fly?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What other films do you like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I like the old MGM musicals. I like things with great acting, like Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy. I love Oliver! One of my friends lives there (England) - Mark Lester. He&rsquo;s a friend of mine. Oliver! is one of my favourite films of all time. When he&rsquo;s here, I visit him and we talk on the phone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why do you like that film in particular so much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ooooooh! It&rsquo;s terrific! It&rsquo;s Dickens&rsquo; story. I mean&hellip; it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s incredible. Lionel Bart&rsquo;s music is unreal&hellip; it&rsquo;s magic. I&rsquo;m going to record that song in the future, one of the songs&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Which one?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Where is love?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you know other movie stars?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, being in the same field. Katharine Hepburn came to our concert on the last tour. That was the first concert she&rsquo;d ever seen. The press were surprised. You know an actress of her stature and the whole Hollywood thing. They were surprised that she would even show up. That was the first concert that she&rsquo;d ever been to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What did she say about it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> She loved it. He told me she loved it and she asked me to come to dinner the next day but we had to move in to the next city, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you have a hero or a heroine in movies that you would really like to meet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I wanted to meet Walt Disney but he died. And I wanted to meet Charlie Chaplin but he died. There&rsquo;s nobody that I would really want to meet. I&rsquo;m gonna work with Steven Spielberg.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Really. Doing what?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> A film. We&rsquo;re going to do a film together. He&rsquo;s just putting the story and ideas together gradually working on ideas. You know I did the &ldquo;E.T. Storybook&rdquo; album and we just finished that. He and Quincy directed the whole thing, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You haven&rsquo;t done any acting since The Wiz, have you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;re looking forward to doing some more?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Obviously most of your time, you&rsquo;re involved in making music. What else are you interested in?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&rsquo;t know really. It&rsquo;s hard to take a break&hellip; &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m always creating stuff&hellip; songwriting&hellip; and that&rsquo;s mainly what I do (laughs) and I&rsquo;m interested in films and acting and that sort of thing&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really involve in sports or any of that stuff&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Whereabouts do you live?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We live in the valley of California.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&rsquo;s it like there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;s, ah, lots of orange trees and lots of lemon trees. The whole valley used to be an orange grove so everywhere you see is orange trees. And, ah, right now (laughs) there&rsquo;s some mud &lsquo;cause it&rsquo; been raining this morning but it&rsquo;s nice and clear now, there&rsquo;s blue skies out&hellip; and wind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What kind of music do you listen to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I like all music, all music. From classical to country to pop. I love Paul McCartney&rsquo;s early solo stuff a lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You worked with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh yeah, it was a lot of fun. He&rsquo;s wonderful. Linda&rsquo;s very nice too. The whole family. Could you say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; to them from me from America?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;ve been so fantastically successful, do you feel you have a lot to live up to? Would you be upset if this LP wasn&rsquo;t as successful as the last?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Um, Yeah. &lsquo;Cause I always like to improve. I don&rsquo;t like to take a step backwards. But it&rsquo;s a whole &lsquo;nother economy now&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You mean people aren&rsquo;t buying as many records?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. That&rsquo;s no excuse though.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> In the &lsquo;70s, why do you think you became so successful?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Probably that we were doing good songs, that we were fresh and new and different and we were real young. And I don&rsquo;t think that there was anything else like that out there. The Osmonds, they came along but they were like a copy of what we did. I like watching them - I&rsquo;m not saying they weren&rsquo;t good - I enjoyed what they did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you still see your brothers?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And you still get along?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Very well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> In the late &lsquo;70s, you were very representative of the &ldquo;disco boom&rdquo;. Is that something you&rsquo;d like to get away from now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&rsquo;t think I do represent &ldquo;disco&rdquo;. We were doing ballads and all kinds of stuff. I wouldn&rsquo;t call &ldquo;One Day In Your Life&rdquo; disco or &ldquo;Never Can Say Goodbye&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rock With You&rdquo;&hellip; um&hellip; um&hellip; I just like good dance music. They can label it whatever they want but as long as it&rsquo;s dance music and people like it&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What English groups do you like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I like Adam Ant&rsquo;s drums. He&rsquo;s a friend of mine also.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Didn&rsquo;t you swap jackets or something?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes (laughs). I was bugging him a long time about his jackets, yeah. (Gives a little shriek of pleasure at the memory.) Yeah, we talk over the phone a lot. I love his drums on his songs. Will you say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; to him from me, too?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How did you come to meet him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;ve never met him. We&rsquo;re phone friends. Whenever he&rsquo;s here he calls me. Like he calls me from the Greek theatre. When I&rsquo;m in England I call him and we talk like we&rsquo;ve known each other for years but we&rsquo;ve never met or seen each other eye to eye.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to meet him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I would, if our schedules meet (laughs).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you talk about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We talk about different musical stuff and how to record drums and the sound he got on &ldquo;Ant Music&rdquo;. He likes my stuff and I like his and he talks about my dancing and I talk about his dressing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you have a very technical approach to your music then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> An emotional one then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, it comes straight from the heart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&rsquo;s the track that you&rsquo;ve been most pleased with?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Probably on &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baby Be Mine&rdquo;. Actually, I can&rsquo;t answer that &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m never really pleased, never totally satisfied. I&rsquo;m a real perfectionist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who would you like to work with that you haven&rsquo;t yet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Streisand is an example. We&rsquo;re going to be doing a duet together. We&rsquo;ll be writing it together. I love her singing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What about Paul McCartney and Rupert Bear?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We talked about it a lot but I didn&rsquo;t come to a decision on working on it. Sweet character&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who? Rupert?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. He seems so innocent and charming, like no matter what he&rsquo;s OK. And, you know, I got a couple of books here for Paul on Rupert. He&rsquo;s real charming. He always reminds me of Winnie the Pooh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you read a lot of books?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;re obviously very interested in magical things and stories?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I love fairy tales. I like fantasy a lot, science fiction, I like magic. I like to create magic. I love magic. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do, it&rsquo;s got to be magic. Something that the person hears it or sees it, they&rsquo;re just totally blown away. The unexpected is what I like.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Any particular writers?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I like J.M. Barrie. Mostly the older guys who aren&rsquo;t here anymore. Their imagination was just out of this world. Frank Baum who did the Oz books. I love Steven Spielberg, he&rsquo;s the modern day Walt Disney. I gave Steven a great book which you can&rsquo;t buy in the stores. It&rsquo;s like this old company that used to make these set of books called Wisdom and it&rsquo;s very hard to find them, but it&rsquo;s the cover story, the hard-book story of Walt Disney and I gave it to Steven. And I wrote an inscription in it and he liked it so much, he said it was the best present he&rsquo;d ever gotten. He told me he reads it every night before he goes to bed. At the back of it there&rsquo;s all these quotations, like things Disney has said in interviews, like words of wisdom, like three whole pages, and we were just reading them together on the aeroplane. I mean he loves it. It&rsquo;s a great book.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What did you inscribe in it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I told Steven how Disney was one of the people who inspired me the most in my music and in so many things and that I felt that nobody has ever come along since Disney has died with his imagination and to fill his shoes and he, Steven Spielberg, was the only person who had inspired me like Walt Disney had inspired me. He gave me a big hug and everything. I mean he was great, he loves it, he says it&rsquo;s the best present he ever got.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So you&rsquo;re good friends?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh yeah, I mean every word of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When are you going to start filming?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Probably after The Jacksons&rsquo; album which we&rsquo;ll start working on in January. Sometime after that we&rsquo;ll just finalise the story and start moving. He&rsquo;s making an animated movie, Steven; he wants me to come up with the story for it (giggles). He told me to start thinking of ideas &lsquo;cause he wants me to work on it and I said, great. So I&rsquo;ve been thinking like crazy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What sort of part will you play in the film he&rsquo;s making with you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Gosh, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a futuristic fantasy-type of thing but they&rsquo;re still not sure of the story so I don&rsquo;t know the role or anything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you go out much in public?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t go out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So you watch films at home?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, we have a movie room. I saw a movie last night in our theatre. We have a theatre in the house where we have film shows. It seats like 32 people and if I want to see E.T. or something I just have it ordered, whatever I like to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is your house big?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ah, yeah, I guess. (giggles with embarrassment)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What other rooms are there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We have a library. We have an exercise room&hellip; and Disney&rsquo;s going to do a whole thing for me, The Pirates Of The Caribbean, in a display room. They&rsquo;re going to have different parts of the Caribbean thing put in my game room. They never do stuff so I felt honoured that they&rsquo;re going to do it for me. They&rsquo;re going to put it in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What, all the props?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Animatronics&rdquo; - where the faces move, the figures move, the eyebrows move, and their eyes and their bodies, and they shoot&hellip; When you step in this room there&rsquo;ll be a whole war going on&hellip; Cannons shooting off and smoke puffing at one another and fighting&hellip; a whole war going on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And that&rsquo;s all going to be set up in your room?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yup.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> As an exhibition or just for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> For me and for company. For whoever comes and wants to see it. They&rsquo;re going to do the sound and the lighting and everything. Then there&rsquo;s this games room&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What sort of games have you got in there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Space Invaders and Star Fire and basketball games.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are you good at them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;m good until some little kid comes along and beats me (laughs).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And there&rsquo;s an exercise room?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. I don&rsquo;t do exercise but it&rsquo;s there for other people. A sauna and stuff like that. It&rsquo;s just a place where, after you work hard, you can come and relax and have a good time and entertain your friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who do you live with?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Just my mother and my two sisters and my father. I still live with my folks. I&rsquo;d die of loneliness if I moved out. Plus I couldn&rsquo;t control the fans and stuff. I&rsquo;d be surrounded. I&rsquo;d never leave the house but here there&rsquo;s guards. Security&hellip; a whole set-up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So you rarely go out?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Very rarely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you ever get mobbed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is it frightening?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, it&rsquo;s more fun &lsquo;cause you get to turn and beck and hide. But once they get you trapped it&rsquo;s not fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What happens then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They start kissing you and pulling you and tearing your clothes and tearing your hair out of your head&hellip; I&rsquo;ve gone to certain countries and I&rsquo;ll walk along and there&rsquo;s a fan and she&rsquo;ll go, &ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo; and she&rsquo;ll show me a piece of hair and say, &ldquo;I took this out of your head two years ago&rdquo;, this piece of hair in her wallet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How do you feel about things like that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; it&rsquo;s strange.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So how do you travel? Do you fly and drive everywhere?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah and we have security with us. We have a private jet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And you have bodyguards, presumably?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I have to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Would you say you lived a normal life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ah, no, I can&rsquo;t say that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you ever long to lead a normal life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I&rsquo;m happy the way I am. I&rsquo;m happy the way I am.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you like groups like The Human League and Soft Cell?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I like those groups. I like &lsquo;em. My favourite English group will always be The Beatles &lsquo;cause they had real good songs. A lot of the bands today have more musical sounds and different sounds and things you&rsquo;ve never heard, but melody and great lyrics is not there. They always had great melody and lyrics - even if it was just a harmonica playing in the background, the melody was the feature of the whole song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&rsquo;s your favourite Beatles song?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> My favourite Beatles song is Paul&rsquo;s favourite Beatles song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Which is that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo;. It always touched me the most. It was always special to me. I think it&rsquo;s wonderful, the melody and the music and the whole feeling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you think anyone&rsquo;s come near The Beatles&rsquo; songwriting quality?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. Holland, Dozier; Holland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you have any particular favourites of theirs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> All of them. That whole &lsquo;60s period to me - with Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles and Motown - was the best musical time in history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &lsquo;Cause they were real songs. Real good songs. Today a writer will have success and then just celebrate the rest of his life and just forget about writing ever again - no self-control, he&rsquo;s partying the rest of his life. Back then people just kept trying, kept coming up with great stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What about the &lsquo;70s?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I like Elton John&rsquo;s stuff - terrific. Bernie Taupin. &ldquo;Yellow Brick Road&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bennie And The Jets&rdquo;. All that stuff. That&rsquo;s great stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What did you like about him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> His image with the feathers and the glasses I thought was good but they were good songs. We&rsquo;re good friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who else do you know in England?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> These are the people I visit there: Mark Lester, the McCartneys, I talk to Adam Ant a lot too on the phone. I know Elton. I know a great songwriter called Don Black&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Where will you be for Christmas?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;ll be at home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mark:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And what would you like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Actually, I don&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas. We just sit round the fire, watch the parade or whatever. We don&rsquo;t really do anything special. We just enjoy the weather. I mean it&rsquo;s 70 or 80 degrees, Christmas out here. We just don&rsquo;t do anything. It&rsquo;s hot. It&rsquo;s burning up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808121717/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/starsouttonight.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Smash Hits&rdquo; magazine (January 20, 1983)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson doesn&rsquo;t often do interviews. This is partly because he&rsquo;s much happier expressing himself his music than words; and partly because a lot of the people who actually get to meet or talk with him are left with the distinct impression that he&rsquo;s just a little strange. And he is. And seeing that&mdash; at the tender age of 23 &mdash; he is already chalked up some of the most colossal sales figures in recording history, he&rsquo;s got every right to be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For much of the time, this faraway voice on the &lsquo;phone has the high-pitched, incredulous tone of a six-year-old at a perpetual firework party. The mention of particular films, books, and songs that he likes are greeted with sudden gasps of wonder and delight as if this was the first time he&rsquo;s ever encountered them. Judging by the meager portion of the &lsquo;real world&rsquo; he&rsquo;s ever really exposed to these days, it&rsquo;s easy to believe that the youngest Jackson brother is actually a visitor from some distant planet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He&rsquo;s calling from his home in The Valley of California, just outside Los Angeles, where he lives with his parents, Katherine and Joe, and his two sisters. This resides in a luxurious belt of costly villas surrounded by orange and lemon groves, a little sudden, he says after a recent rainstorm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a full 13 years of adulation from press, fans and record company magnates&mdash;the Jackson Five first hit the jackpot in &rsquo;69 when he was just 10 &mdash; Michael&rsquo;s become something of a recluse. He seems perfectly content to shut himself away in a curious fairytale world of science fiction and cartoon fantasy &mdash; or &ldquo;magic&rdquo; as he calls it &mdash; from which he draws the inspiration for his songwriting. &rdquo; I like things,&rdquo; as he puts it, &ldquo;that when a person hears or sees them, they are just totally blown away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &lsquo;mod cons&rsquo; around the house certainly bear this out. In one room there are rows of Space Invader machines; in another Walt Disney are busy installing a complete working of The Pirates Of The Caribbean, fully automated Disneyland figures who launch into lifelike combat at the mere flick of a switch.-When you step in this room,&rdquo; he says. spellbound, &ldquo;there&lsquo;ll be this whole war going on, cannons shooting off and smoke puffing at one another&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Down the hall, there&rsquo;s a movie theatre, a fully-blown 32-seater cinema for which he constantly orders up entertainment. The most regular visitor to the family screen is E T. which he likes so much that he actually collaborated with its director, Steven Spielberg, on the &ldquo;E.T. Storybook&rdquo; LP. &ldquo;I love E T. &lsquo;cos it reminds me of me,&rdquo; he says mysteriously. &ldquo;Someone from another world coming down and you becoming friends with them and this person is, like 800 years old and he&rsquo;s filling you with all kinds of wisdom and he can teach you how to fly. That whole fantasy thing which I think is great. I mean, who don&rsquo;t wanna fly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He and Spielberg are about to embark on a couple more joint ventures, a financial pairing that&rsquo;ll no doubt put even Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder in the shade. One&rsquo;s a &ldquo;futuristic fantasy type film&rdquo; with Michael in an acting role; the other&rsquo;s an animation for which he&rsquo;ll be supplying the storyline and has been &ldquo;thinking like crazy!&rdquo; &ldquo;I even gave Steven a present, a book on Walt Disney, as he&rsquo;s the only person who&rsquo;s inspired me in my music as much as Disney. He told me he loves it and gave me a big hug and everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Together with Quincy Jones, who was also the musical director for the &ldquo;E.T. Story-book&rdquo; project, he&rsquo;s just released a new LP, &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo;, and the second single from it, &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The album is the eventual sequel to what Epic Records rightly describe as his &ldquo;landmark LP&rdquo;, &ldquo;Off The Wall&rdquo;, which was released in 1979 and went on to sell a staggering total of seven million copies worldwide. A hard act to follow. &ldquo;Yeah, well, I always like to improve,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to take a step backward, but it&rsquo;s a whole &lsquo;nother economy now. People aren&rsquo;t buying as many records, though that&rsquo;s no excuse.&rdquo; What qualities does he look for when selecting material then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;For the music to be outstanding and, more than anything else, the melody. What&rsquo;s best for today&rsquo;s sound and today&rsquo;s market.&rdquo; Asked who he admires, he lists early McCartney solo material, &rsquo;60s Motown, Simon and Garfunkel, Elton John and &ldquo;Adam Ant&rsquo;s drums&ldquo;. Adam, in fact, is one of a small but intimate circle of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s friends, despite the fact that they&rsquo;ve never actually met in the flesh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re phone-friends,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;We talk about how to record that drum sound on &lsquo;Ant Music&rsquo; and stuff. He talks about my dancing and I talk about his dressing&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Could you say &lsquo;hi&rsquo; to him for me?&rdquo; Other friends include the English actor Mark Lester, who played the starring role in the musical Oliver, Elton John, and Paul McCartney &mdash; &ldquo;say &lsquo;hi&rsquo; to him and Linda too&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s acquainted, also, with various film celebrities, among them 73-year-old Hollywood star Katharine Hepburn (who once saw a Jackson concert and promptly invited him to dinner) and Barbra Streisand, who he&rsquo;ll be recording a duet with fairly soon. His life, however, does unto a little isolated, I suggest. A little remote.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Has he ever thought of moving away from the family home? &ldquo;I&rsquo;d die of loneliness if I moved out,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and, plus, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to control the fans and stuff. I&rsquo;d be surrounded. But here there&rsquo;s guards and security, the whole set-up&ldquo;. He ventures outside &rdquo;very rarely&ldquo;, and even then he&rsquo;s permanently flanked by bodyguards and whisked straight off to the private jet. He talks about the hordes of admirers constantly watching his every move with extraordinary naivety.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Is fun sometimes &lsquo;cos you get to run and dodge and hide. But once they have you trapped it&rsquo;s not fun&ldquo;. As an example, he relates a chilling tale about a fan he once met who opened up her purse to reveal a lock of his hair she&rsquo;d painfully removed two years before. A note of resignation creeps into his voice. You can&rsquo;t say he leads a normal life. &ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t say that&hellip;&rdquo; Do you ever wish you could? &ndash;No-. he says quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy the way I am.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
