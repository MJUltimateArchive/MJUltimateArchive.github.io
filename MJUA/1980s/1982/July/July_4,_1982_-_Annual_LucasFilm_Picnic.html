I can&#39;t remember what film we were working on but he was with Quincy Jones and he was touring the facility. He was wearing his famous white mask at the time. What struck me immediately as he came by was how soft spoken and shy he was. Quincy Jones, who was with him was definitely in charge as he was asking questions and throwing out the good vibes at anyone present in the room. As Michael walked up to my station he was looking at my Matte Painting and said...&quot; If I could paint like that I would give up singing&quot;....of course he was not serious but it was a kind gesture. ILM was having their annual 4th of July party at SkyWalker Ranch and Michael Jackson and Quincy showed up at the event.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I am a Jazz fan and I had followed Quincy&#39;s career . So I boldly walked up to him while he was with his then wife Peggy Lipton ( Mod Squad ) and child as well as Michael and said..&quot; Quincy, I am Frank and I just wanted to meet you and say that I have your album &quot; Walking in Space&quot; and I think the song &quot; Killer Joe&quot; just grooves&quot;. He just stopped what he was doing and said &quot; You&#39;ve got that album?&quot; I said &quot; Yeah&quot;...I listen too it all the time&quot; and I hummed a few bars from his album. Quincy said something to the effect of &quot; I am glad somebody still grooves to jazz dude&quot; He then invited me to hang around with them for awhile. So I spent the good part of the day hanging with Quincy Jones and talking Jazz.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile Michael was off by himself while hundreds of LucasFilm employees and their families milled about. He seemed in another world. My girlfriend at the time kept walking up to him and asking &quot; Is everything alright...Can I get you something&quot;. He replied &quot; Pay me no mind &quot;. He just wanted to be left alone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That image of Michael Jackson, alone in the crowd will stay with me.</span></p></body>
