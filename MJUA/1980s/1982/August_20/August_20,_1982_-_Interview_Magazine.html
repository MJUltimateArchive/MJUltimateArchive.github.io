Somewhere in San Fernando Valley. Bob Colacello arrives at the condominium that Michael Jackson and his family are temporarily renting while their house nearby is being redecorated. Michael, who everyone remembers as the boy lead singer of the Jackson Five, has built a solid solo career for himself&mdash;his last album, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Off the Wall</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, has sold over 5 million copies in the U.S. alone. Though he also still records with his brothers, now known as The Jacksons, Michael has branched out to work with such superstars as Paul McCartney, Quincy Jones, Diana Ross and Steven Spielberg, all of whom are close friends. While waiting for a phone call from Andy Warhol in New York, BC and MJ began chatting about another close friend, Jane Fonda.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL JACKSON: The night that Henry Fonda died, I went over there and I was with the family. They were talking and watching all the different news pieces. Although her father died, Jane was still able to show an interest in my career, asking me have I gotten the film yet, and I thought that was very sweet. I think that they had been expecting him to die for so long. Months and months and months ago she was talking as though it was going to be any day. It happened and there were tears sometimes and laughter sometimes and they ate a little.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BOB COLACELLO: So what are you doing? Have you gotten a movie to do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Well, right now I&#39;m just finishing up the album [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller &mdash;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">Ed.] and concentrating on that. I&#39;m doing the other album as well, the </span><span class="cs43C038A">E.T.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album, at the same time. That album is a little new for me because I&#39;ve never narrated a story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: What is the </span><span class="cs43C038A">E.T.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: It&#39;s a storybook album, a double album and I&#39;m narrating the whole story and singing the song which we have to come up with and write. We&#39;ve been just meeting and talking about it with Steven [Spielberg] for I don&#39;t know how long&mdash;getting together and talking about making it the all-time storybook album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: The album you&#39;re doing, you&#39;ve written everything on it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I&#39;ve written four or five songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Steve [Rubell] told me you&#39;re doing something with Paul McCartney?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes. Paul was just here and a song I wrote called &quot;The Girl Is Mine,&quot; we sing together on my album. We&#39;re fighting over this girl in the song and it came out beautifully. For </span><span class="cs43C038A">his</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album, we wrote and sang two songs together, his </span><span class="cs43C038A">Tug &lsquo;O War Part II. </span><span class="csD5D7D290">But for mine it&#39;s the song that I wrote. There&#39;s a rap at the end where we&#39;re fighting over her. It&#39;s funny.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You&#39;re very open to working with other stars. Very often people aren&#39;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I&#39;m not actually. Not at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You worked with Diana Ross...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Only very special people. I mean, Diana&#39;s like a mother-lover-friend to me. She&#39;s wonderful. I just wrote, produced, and edited her next single, &quot;Muscles.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Did you write the lyrics, too?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Lyrics, music&mdash;I just finished that and it should be coming out at the end of the month.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Where do you find the time to do all this writing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: On airplanes. I was coming back from England working on Paul McCartney&#39;s album, zooming along on the Concorde, and this song popped into my head. I said, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s perfect for Diana!&quot; I didn&#39;t have a tape recorder or anything so I had to suffer for like three hours. Soon as I got home I whipped that baby on tape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you care about politics at all?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I don&#39;t like talking about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You don&#39;t get into that at all with Jane [Fonda]?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No, we do. She&#39;s wonderful. She teaches me all kinds of stuff. When I was on the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Golden Pond</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> set I stayed with Jane in the cabin and we were all alone on the water and we&#39;d just talk, talk, talk about everything. It was the greatest education for me&mdash;she&#39;d learn and I&#39;d learn and we&#39;d just play off of each other. We talked about all kinds of things, you name it: politics, philosophers, racism, Vietnam, acting, all kinds of things. It was magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Where were you educated, because you were always on the road?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Private schools or tutors.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You come from Gary, Indiana? What was it like growing up there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Actually, I was so small I don&#39;t remember. When I was five I was touring, singing and dancing. Always gone, always out of school. I just remember little things like the corner store or certain people in the neighborhood. The high school behind us always had a big band with trumpets and trombones and drums coming down the street&mdash;I used to love that&mdash;like a parade. That&#39;s all I remember.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Did you like performing as a child? Did you always love it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Always did. I always enjoyed the feeling of being on stage&mdash;the magic that comes. When I hit the stage it&#39;s like all of a sudden a magic from somewhere just comes and the spirit just hits you and you just lose control of yourself. I came on stage at Quincy&#39;s [Jones] concert at the Rose Bowl and I did not want to go on stage. I was ducking and hiding and hoping he wouldn&#39;t see me hiding behind people when he called me on. Then I went up there and I just went crazy. I started climbing up the scaffold, the speakers, the light gear. The audience started getting into it and I started dancing and singing and that&#39;s what happens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: How do you compare acting to performing on the stage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I love both. Acting is the cream of the crop. I love performing. It&#39;s a phenomenal getaway. It you want to really let our everything you feel, that&#39;s the time to do it. With acting, it&#39;s like becoming another person. I think that&#39;s neat, especially when you totally forget. If you totally forget, which I love to do, that&#39;s when it&#39;s magic. I love to create magic&mdash;to put something together that&#39;s so unusual, so unexpected that it blows people&#39;s heads off. Something ahead of the times. Five steps ahead of what people are thinking. So people see it and say, &quot;Whoa. I wasn&#39;t expecting that.&quot; I love surprising people with a present of a gift or a stage performance or anything. I love John Travolta, who came off that </span><span class="cs43C038A">Kotter</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> show. Nobody knew he could dance or do all of those things. He is like&mdash;boom. Before he knew it, he was the next big Brando or something.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: He hasn&#39;t done much lately.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I know. I think he&#39;s choosing scripts and stuff. It&#39;s always difficult for anyone trying to compete against their past achievements.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Tell me, who do you think has made breakthrough in their work in any field?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I love Steven Spielberg so much. I just love James Brown. He&#39;s phenomenal. I&#39;ve never seen a performer create electricity with an audience like James Brown. He&#39;s got everybody in his hands and whatever he wants to do with them, he does it. It&#39;s amazing. I&#39;ve always thought he was underrated. I love Sammy Davis Jr., I love Fred Astaire. I love George Lucas. I&#39;m crazy about Jane Fonda and Katharine Hepburn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: I saw a picture of you with Katharine Hepburn on the set of </span><span class="cs43C038A">On Golden Pond.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I feel honored to know her because there are a lot of people she doesn&#39;t like&mdash;she&#39;ll tell you right away if she doesn&#39;t like you. When I first met her, I was a little shaky because you hear things about her&mdash;Jane filled me in. I was kind of scared. But right away she invited me to dinner that day. Ever since then we&#39;ve been best friends. She came to our concert&mdash;the first concert she&#39;s ever been to&mdash;at the [Madison Square] Garden, and she just enjoyed herself. We call each other on the phone and she sends me letters. She&#39;s just wonderful. I went to her house in New York and se showed me her Spencer Tracy&#39;s favorite chair and his private things in his closet, his little knick-knacks. I think he&#39;s just magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Are you a fan of old movies?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Oh, yes. There was a lot of great art, great acting, great directing, great stories. When it comes to stuff like </span><span class="cs43C038A">Captains Courageous</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> or </span><span class="cs43C038A">Boys&#39; Town, Father Flanagan, Woman of the Year&mdash;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">that stuff is unreal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Why don&#39;t you write a story of your own?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: That&#39;s what we&#39;re working on right now. We&#39;re kind of fooling with it, Quincy and Steven and I&mdash;hopefully we&#39;ll be able to do something with it. Steven wants to do a musical.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Would you like to do Broadway?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Not yet. I think it&#39;s good for sharpening your skills. It&#39;s the best for really reaching the zenith of your talent. You go so far and reach the peak of it and you say, &quot;Maybe this is the best performance I can do.&quot; What&#39;s so sad about the whole thing is that you don&#39;t capture that moment. Look at how many great actors or entertainers have been lost to the world because they did a performance one night and that was it. With film, you capture that, it&#39;s shown all over the world and it&#39;s there forever. Spencer Tracy will always be young in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Captain Courageous</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and I can learn and be stimulated by his performance. So much is lost in theater, so much. Or Vvudeville. Do you know what I could have learned by watching all those entertainers? It would be unreal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Most plays are videotaped now, but not every night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: That&#39;s the thing. The actor&#39;s tense, he&#39;s being taped and things are not falling naturally. That&#39;s what I hate about Boadway. I feel like I&#39;m giving a whole lot for nothing. I like to capture things and hold them there and share them with the whole world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: It seems that what really motivates you is your desire to entertain people, to please people. What about fame and money? Could you imagine not being famous or does being famous bother you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: It never has bothered me except sometimes when you want peace. Like you go to the theater and you say, &quot;Nobody&#39;s bothering me tonight, I&#39;m wearing my hat and glasses and I&#39;m going to enjoy this film and that&#39;s all there is to it.&quot; You get there and everybody&#39;s watching and staring at you and at the climax of the film somebody taps you on the shoulder for an autograph. You just feel like you can&#39;t get away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Is that why you live out here in the Valley as opposed to Beverly Hills where all the other stars live?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes, but it&#39;s just as bad. Beverly Hills is worse because they go there looking for them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You&#39;re very close to your parents. Do they live out here in L.A.?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes. My mother&#39;s upstairs. My father&#39;s at the office.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: What&#39;s your typical day like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Daydreaming most of the day. I get up early and get ready for whatever I&#39;ve got to do, songwriting or whatever it is. Planning the future and stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Are you optimistic about the future?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes. I always like to plan ahead of time and follow up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Liza Minnelli&#39;s a friend of yours, isn&#39;t she?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: How could I forget her? I&#39;m crazy about Liza. Add her to the list of my favorite people. I just love her to death. We get on the phone and we just gossip, gossip, gossip. What I like about Liza is that when we get together it&#39;s all show talk. I show her my favorite steps and she shows me hers. She&#39;s a show-stopping performer, too. She has real charisma. In the future I&#39;d like to record her. I think a person like her should be heard on the radio and accepted that whole thing. She&#39;s magic on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you care about fashion much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No. I care about what I wear on stage. You know what I love, though? I don&#39;t care about everyday clothes. I love putting on an outfit or a costume and just looking at myself in the mirror. Baggy pants or some real funky shoes and a hat and just feeling the character of it. That&#39;s fun to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You like to act a lot just in everyday life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I love it so much. It&#39;s escape. It&#39;s fun. It&#39;s just neat to become another thing, another person. Especially when you really believe it and it&#39;s not like you&#39;re acting. I always hated the world &quot;acting&quot;&mdash;to say, &quot;I&#39;m an actor.&quot; It should be more like a believer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: But isn&#39;t that a little frightening when you believe it totally?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No, that&#39;s what I love about it. I just like to really forget.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Why do you want to forget so much? Do you think life is really hard?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No, maybe it&#39;s because I just like jumping in other people&#39;s lives and exploring. Like Charlie Chaplin. I just love him to death. The little tramp, the whole gear and everything, and his heart&mdash;everything he portrayed on the screen was a truism. It was his whole life. He was born in London, and his father died an alcoholic when he was six. His mother was in an insane asylum. He roamed the streets of England, begging, poor, hungry. All this reflects on the screen and that&#39;s what I like to do, to bring all of the truths out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you care about making money?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I care about being paid fairly for what I do. When I approach a project, I put my whole heart and soul into it. Because I really care about it, I put everything I&#39;ve got into it and I want to be paid. That guy who works should eat. It&#39;s that simple.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You follow your own business very closely then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Oh, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: How old are you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Twenty-three.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you sometimes feel as though you missed out on childhood because you&#39;ve always been performing in the adult world?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Sometimes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: But you like people older than yourself, experienced people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I love experienced people. I love people who are phenomenally talented. I love people who&#39;ve worked so hard and been so courageous and are the leaders in ther fields. For me to meet somebody like that and learn from them and share words with them&mdash;to me that&#39;s magic. To work together. I&#39;m crazy about Steven Spielberg. Another inspiration for me, and I don&#39;t know where it came from, is children. If I&#39;m down, I&#39;ll take a book with children&#39;s pictures and look at it and it will just lift me up. Being around children is magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: There is something positive and encouraging about them. You have a lot of animals, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I used to. Right now I only have two baby deer, one&#39;s a boy and one&#39;s a girl. They&#39;re so sweet. They&#39;re gorgeous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: I&#39;ll never understand how people can shoot deer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I hate it. I hate taxidermy shops and all that crap. I have a llama. I have a sheep&mdash;he looks just like a ram with the horns. Louie is from the circus. He&#39;s the llama. The ram is called Mr. Tibbs and the fawns are Prince and Princess.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: What are you going to do with them when they grow?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Let them go in the yard and stuff. We have just about two acres.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: What kind of car do you have?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: A Rolls. A black one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you like driving it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I never want to drive. My parents forced me to drive. Quincy doesn&#39;t drive. A lot of people I know don&#39;t drive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Andy [Warhol] doesn&#39;t drive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: That&#39;s smart. But it&#39;s good when you want a little independence to get away. But I don&#39;t go many places, I don&#39;t know many places. I just drive down the street.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You don&#39;t go out much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Only to go to the Golden Temple, a health food restaurant. I&#39;m a vegetarian. Or I go to the arcade and play the game.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Are you interested in art?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I love to draw&mdash;pencil, ink pen&mdash;I love art. When I go on tour and visit museums in Holland, Germany, or England&mdash;you know those huge paintings?&mdash;I&#39;m just amazed. You don&#39;t think a painter could do something like that I can look at a piece of sculpture or a painting and totally lose myself in it. Standing there watching it and becoming part of the scene. It can draw tears, it can touch you so much. See, that&#39;s where I think the actor or performer should be&mdash;to touch that truth inside of a person. Touch that reality so much that they become a part of what you&#39;re going and you can take them anywhere you want to. You&#39;re happy, they&#39;re happy. Whatever the human emotion, they&#39;re right there with you. I love realism. I don&#39;t like plastics. Deep down inside we&#39;re all the same. We all have the same emotions and that&#39;s why a film like </span><span class="cs43C038A">E.T.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> touches everybody. Who doesn&#39;t want to fly like Peter Pan? Who doesn&#39;t want to fly with some magic creature from outer space and be friends with him? Steven went straight to the heart. He knows&mdash;when in doubt, go for the heart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You&#39;re religious, aren&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes, I believe in the Bible and I believe in God whose name is Jehovah and that whole thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Someone said that&#39;s why you don&#39;t shave.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Oh no! I don&#39;t grow anything to shave. That&#39;s got nothing to do with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: So you&#39;re just a basic Christian.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I believe in truth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you read the Bible?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes, a lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you go to church?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: We don&#39;t call it church. It&#39;s Kingdom Hall. It&#39;s Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You mentioned that you are going to see Bette Midler tomorrow? Are you working on something together?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No, I go to this guy names Seth Riggs. When I sing, I like to get my voice all opened up&mdash;like a dancer warming up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: So, it&#39;s like breathing classes?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Right. And right after I do mine, in she comes. She&#39;s always on time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[</span><span class="cs43C038A">Andy Warhol calls from New York.</span><span class="csD5D7D290">]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ANDY WARHOL: Hello?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Hi.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: Gosh, this is exciting.

She was in Europe but then I saw her at Halston&#39;s fashion show. She changed her hairdo. Her hair looks more like yours now. It&#39;s really curly in front and she looks really different and it&#39;s really pretty. She has a great new look. She went out to Halston&#39;s last weekend and she&#39;s in New York right now. How have you been?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I&#39;ve been in the studio a lot. Writing lyrics and working on songs and stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: I might go see an English rock group at the Ritz tonight called Duran Duran. Do you know them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: I went to see Blondie at the Meadowlands last week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: How was Blondie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: She was great. She&#39;s so terrific. Do you know her?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No, I never met her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: Well, when you come to New York I&#39;ll introduce her. Going on tour is about the hardest thing to do in the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Tour is something&mdash;the pacing. But being on stage is the most magic thing about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: I can&#39;t wait until you do a really big movie. Have they asked you to do anything?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: My room I loaded with scripts and offers. And a lot of them are great ideas. But the kind of person I am is that I have a person in mind that I&#39;d like to work with and I&#39;m trying to make sure I do the right thing. I just don&#39;t want to make a mistake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: Just do them all. You can&#39;t make a mistake. You&#39;re really good. Did you ever think you&#39;d grow up to be a singer?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I don&#39;t even remember </span><span class="cs43C038A">not</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> singing, so I never dreamed of singing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: Are you still collecting clothes? Do you have a good designer?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Actually, I don&#39;t really get into that unless I&#39;m going on stage. The only thing I like collecting is costumes or pirate coats or things like that. But everyday fashion I don&#39;t get into.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: What do you wear?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Right now I have on corduroy pants with a big hole in the knee and a pink shirt and tie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: Do you go out a lot of stay home?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I stay home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WARHOL: Why do you stay home?

I love to read. I like philosophy and short stories. I like to keep up with the latest best-sellers. The Calendar in the Sunday </span><span class="cs43C038A">L.A. Times</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> is my favorite paper. It really lets you know what&#39;s going on everywhere. I have my favorite authors&mdash;it&#39;s not like I just read the best-sellers. I like to see what they are doing and keep with what people are interested in. There&#39;s a lot of physical stuff now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Do you exercise?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Every Sunday I dance for 30 minutes straight without stopping.

I think that&#39;s great. To really make it work you have to do it properly. That&#39;s the sewer valve of the system. You have to keep that clean like you clean the outside of your body. All these impurities come out of your system because you&#39;re not clean inside. It comes out in pimples or disease or through big pores. Toxins trying to get out of your system. People should keep themselves clean.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: You don&#39;t read page one of the newspaper.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: No. I might look at it but I won&#39;t read it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">COLACELLO: Too depressing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes.

You pay your five bucks to get in and sit there and you&#39;re in another world. Forget about the problems in the world. It&#39;s wonderful. It&#39;s entertaining.

I used to wear a string of pearls for years, and I put some of those things- not the pearls, but some of my broaches and whatnot on Michael, and it kind of- because it was Michael, turned into a thing that lead to all the iconography of Michael Jackson as a king- as the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Andy Warhol, artist, Andy Warhol Diaries (&ldquo;Sunday, September 16, 1984&rdquo; entry)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Matthew [Rolston] wears brooches.
