When listening to the tracks, due to mixing work, Michael&rsquo;s voice isn&rsquo;t directly recognizable. Could you explain to us your musical choices?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Bill Wolfer: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Since it was the first solo album by an unknown, I certainly wasn&rsquo;t shy about asking a few of my friends to help out. Michael and I got to the point where we got along very well, and we respected each other, and enjoyed each other&rsquo;s company. I didn&rsquo;t know if he would do it, but I thought, why not ask? I was delighted that he immediately accepted. And I never intended for his voice to be recognizable, I just wanted him to fill out the background vocals, adding a fourth voice to the great family group, The Waters. If I had tried for some sort of solo thing from him, then it would have been complicated. But it was a classic Motown song, and he was from that era.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Invincible&rdquo;: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Could you share with us your experiences in studio with Michael during the recording of these songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Wolfer: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I hadn&rsquo;t told The Waters anything other than I had invited someone to sing with them. I didn&rsquo;t want them to be disappointed if for some reason Michael couldn&rsquo;t make it. But he did, right on time, and you should have seen their faces when they saw who was going to be singing with them! Michael loved doing the session. He loved being in the studio, and working, and it was fun for him to just be a studio singer for the day. No pressure, just sing, blend in with the group, and be professional, and he had fun doing that. They knocked it out so fast, that Michael was disappointed that it was over, and asked if I had anything else they could sing on. I told the engineer to put &quot;So Shy&quot; on the machine, and we did that in no time. It was a fun, relaxed session.</span></p></body>
