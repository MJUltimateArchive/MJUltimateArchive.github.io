I told him about the exotic circus animals owned and trained by &ldquo;Fay&rdquo;, the Barnum and Bailey circus animal trainer who was my close friend and trainer of my Arabian Stallion, Bizarre Bi Bask. I described in detail, all the many tricks that Louie, Fay&rsquo;s circus performing llama was trained to do. Intrigued, Michael asked me to bring Louie over to the Encino house to visit. A few days later I arrived at the Jackson&rsquo;s family Tudor mansion in Encino with &ldquo;Louie&rdquo; the llama and a circus trained freak female lamb with horns (brought along just to keep Louie calm in the horse trailer). Since the Jackson home was under construction, no one was at the house except the security guard, I was let into the compound to wait for Michael to arrive for our scheduled meeting time. The exterior walls were up and looked almost complete from the outside, though the windows were not installed the openings were there. Inside, the walls were not yet up on the framing and the floor was still concrete. The stairs were in solid enough to climb, so I decided to take Louie the llama upstairs where we could overlook the entry of the house so when MIchael arrived he could see Louie with his head out the hole made for a window. Michael drove in to see Louie&rsquo;s head and neck fully extended out the upper window of the mansion. Sending me a big smile, Michael Jackson shouted in joy and waved to me and his new friend looking out his house window, Louie, soon to be his first solely owned pet. We scurried down the massive stairs into the front yard, where Michael and I pet and spoke softly to Louie. Out of ignorance of llama&rsquo;s, I put my lips on Louie&rsquo;s and made kissing noises. Louie suddenly drew his head back bringing his ears forward and spew thick slobbers all over my face and over spraying Michael. M.J. laughed hysterically. I had to join him robustly as I wiped the slimy stuff off my face. The song, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna take a miracle&rdquo; was running in my head all day. Unconsciously I started singing it aloud. &nbsp;Michael joined in with obvious glee and surprise, then told me it was his favorite song and that he loved Denise Williams the singer. After playing with the llama for some time, I introduced the lamb. Upon meeting Louie&rsquo;s companion, the freak female horned lamb, Michael fell in love with her too and insisted in buying both animals. I made the necessary arrangements with Fay after long negotiations since she needed these animals for her circus act and also had a fondness for them. She gave in finally, only because it was Michael Jackson who wanted them.</span></p></body>
