And we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing and throwing stuff at each other and making jokes. It was just a lot of fun, and we actually recorded the track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and we do have footage of it, but it&#39;s never been shown.

So, I just orally put it all on tape.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Klenk played a tape of Jackson composing the song. &ldquo;Let the song create itself,&rdquo; Jackson was heard saying on the tape. &ldquo;Let it tell you where to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s moving testimony turned into a classroom lesson on songwriting and provided a rare glimpse into the personality of the dynamic entertainer. For although he is soft spoken and shy, he is confident and believes in his talent, his music and his excellent business sense.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Songs are spiritual things,&rdquo; he told the courtroom. &ldquo;They create themselves as if you are not doing it, as if it is there already. It&rsquo;s very spiritual.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;It reminds me of a writer by the name of L. Frank Baum, who wrote the original Wizard of Oz story...He said one day he was sitting reading to his grandchildren and he got an idea and he ran up the stairs and he wrote The Oz story. He said it recreated itself as if the pen was moving all by itself. It just happened and when I read that, it reminded me of my songwriting,&rdquo; said Jackson. &ldquo;It is very spiritual like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He recalled that he recorded the demonstration tape of the tune at the Allen Zentz Studio in Los Angeles. &ldquo;I wanted to have a real nice sounding tape and, to do nice strings, you need a good wooden floor and a good ceiling, and so I decided I would use Allen Zentz.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jackson said Paul McCartney arrived for the actual recording session at the Westlake Studios in Los Angeles with his personal movie crew to film the historic session. &ldquo;He filmed most of the session,&rdquo; Jackson told the jury. &ldquo;He had a film crew there, lighting crew, cameraman. Christopher Cross stopped by. Dick Clark came in, Lionel Richie came in, the engineer, Quincy Jones, my sister (LaToya) came; my mother came. There was a lot of traffic,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson remembered how producer Jones suggested that a rap be included &ldquo;Quincy called me up one morning and says, &lsquo;Smelly,&rsquo; he calls me Smelly,&rdquo; Jackson smiled as the courtroom spectators chuckled. &ldquo;He called me up,&rdquo; he continued, &lsquo;&lsquo;and he said, &lsquo;Smelly, we have to have some rapping in this&rsquo;, to complete the composition. I said, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Klenk: &ldquo;Do you hear any of the music that you used in &#39;The Girl Is Mine&#39; in your other works?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: &ldquo;Oh, yes, lots of other songs... They are mainly the same chords that I use in so many...of my songs in the past, that I have written. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s What You Get for Being Polite&rsquo; is one. Others would be, &lsquo;Why Can&rsquo;t I Be&#39;, &lsquo;Thank You For Life&rsquo;, all these have the main&mdash;the same type of chords as &#39;The Girl Is Mine&#39;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mike Smallcombe, author of &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the rehearsal session, a date was chosen for the pair to record the song in the main studio. At noon on Wednesday, April 14, 1982, McCartney joined Michael in the new Westlake Studio on Beverly Boulevard for what became a three-day recording session. Working with Michael for the first time was an engineer called Matt Forger. &ldquo;I met Michael because I was working with Quincy at the time, and Michael&rsquo;s project was simply the next one on Quincy&rsquo;s schedule,&rdquo; Forger said. It was the start of a professional relationship and friendship that would last more than 20 years. Forger said &lsquo;The Girl Is Mine&rsquo; was recorded in April because it was a good time for all parties involved, even though the main sessions for Michael&rsquo;s album weren&rsquo;t due to start for a few months.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With two stars such as Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney collaborating, the session was particularly enjoyable for the musicians involved. Steve Porcaro described it as &lsquo;incredible&rsquo;. &ldquo;Michael and Paul sang live with the band, I sat down with Paul&rsquo;s wife Linda and had a chat&hellip; it was great,&rdquo; the Toto keyboardist recalls. &ldquo;So many people came in. At the end of the session, a whole entourage of people left the studio, including Michael, Paul, Linda, Quincy, Michael&rsquo;s people, Paul&rsquo;s people, musicians and engineers. But somehow, Paul managed to escape from the crowd. I stayed behind in the studio with my brother Jeff, who was playing the drums on the track, and we were having a smoke of something. All of a sudden, this head pops around the corner. It was Paul. He had snuck back into the studio! When he saw us, he just said, &lsquo;Ahhhh, musicians&hellip;&rsquo; So he sat down and had a smoke with us. How he managed to lose everyone without anyone noticing I&rsquo;ll never know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said recording &lsquo;The Girl Is Mine&rsquo; was one of the most enjoyable studio moments of his entire career. McCartney arrived at Westlake with a personal movie crew in tow to film the session, and celebrities who visited the studio include Christopher Cross, Dick Clark and Lionel Richie. &ldquo;Working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time.&rdquo; Although he enjoyed recording &lsquo;The Girl Is Mine&rsquo;, Michael later admitted the song never fully satisfied him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Quincy Jones, album co-producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">Telegraph (November 25, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102410/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191214075455/https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Girl is Mine was fun: Paul was in Tucson and we had to go down there and work with him for two or three days, which was fun, and rehearsing the song, and finding things to make them tailor-made for him, like the verse at the end and the rap that they had, fighting over the same girl.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Paich, keyboards, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">Telegraph (November 25, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102410/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/25/sv_thriller.xml"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191214075455/https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/articulo-the-making-of-thriller-album-in-the-telegraph.76572/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Working with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson on a duet, The Girl is Mine: that was a very magical night.

I was working with Quincy Jones and we were doing the Donna Summer album and we had to take a break in the middle of doing the record because that was the only time Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney were able to schedule free time to be in the studio. That was for the recording of the song &ldquo;The Girl is Mine,&rdquo; which was the first song for the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album&hellip; At that time he was reserved, he was rather quiet, but at the same time extremely focused. He knew everything that had to happen in a song. He was very directed, very in tune with where all the parts musically needed to be. He was very professional, very well-prepared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Clazi Van Corso, Animal Owner</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael called me at about 3 a.m on April 15,1982. &nbsp;His tone was as if he were calling in the afternoon, explaining that he just finished his second session with Paul McCartney recording &ldquo;the Girl is Mine&rdquo;. In his innocent soft voice, he went on to ask me if I could get two baby deer for him, Janet, and LaToya to hand raise from a few days old. I explained that it would take constant feeding and caring every few hours, 24-7. He said he was prepared to do that with the help of his sisters, just so the baby deer would think he was their mother. I contacted Steve Martin, not the actor, but the wild animal trainer outside Los Angeles in Canyon Country. I was able to get the two very young baby deer for Michael and his sisters to raise right there in the back yard off the Boulevard in Encino, Ca. From my times with Michael Jackson, I perceived a boy man with so much love in his heart that it crowded his music industry lifestyle, snuffing out the criticism in humility. It&rsquo;s a pity how wrongly induced shame can destroy the very core of a person even a star as bright and shining as our beloved Michael Jackson.</span></p></body>
