That month (February, 1983) Jackson was featured on the cover of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Rolling Stone</span><span class="csD5D7D290">; &quot;Beat It&quot; joined &quot;Billie Jean&quot; at the top of the charts; his videos played in a loop on MTV; and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was flying off shelves like loaves of bread.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Buzzie&quot; was Buz Kohan, renowned television producer and writer (best known for his work on award shows and variety shows, including the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> special). Jackson first met him when the singer was just 12 years old. Buz lived nearby in Encino on beautiful Beaumont Street. He was a well-known veteran in the entertainment industry, and the two became good friends. Jackson would ask Buz endless questions about legendary figures like Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, Sammy Davis and Fred Astaire&mdash;the &quot;greats,&quot; as he called them. They later worked closely in Las Vegas for the Jackson family&#39;s variety show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We oughta write some songs together,&quot; a teenage Jackson suggested one day. They began co-writing soon after and their collaborations, which included songs like &quot;Scared of the Moon&quot; and &quot;You Were There,&quot; continued over the next two decades.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Buz&#39;s wife, Rhea, had grown accustomed to Jackson&#39;s late night calls. &quot;Just a second,&quot; she said, passing the phone to her husband. Jackson was calling that night about a particular song. Earlier that evening he had watched Dionne Warwick (a good friend) perform a<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6A_C91wvUY%5D"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6A_C91wvUY%5D"><span class="cs8567212B">tribute on the TV special</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">, &quot;Here&#39;s Television Entertainment.&quot; It was dedicated to many performers whose lives had been cut short too soon&mdash;John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Sam Cooke, among others&mdash;but its poignancy was especially felt due to the death of Karen Carpenter just days earlier at the age of 32.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Certain singers carry with them the energy of their time,&quot; Warwick had said. &quot;They become symbols or signposts. They&#39;re reminders of our frailties and need to communicate... [Tonight] we are left with unanswered questions that are asked when any great talent is consumed before its time: Why? What if? And what might have been?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Warwick proceeded to sing a moving rendition of a song co-written by Buz Kohan and Larry Grossman. It was called &quot;Gone Too Soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson said he wept as he watched. He had grown up with the music of the Carpenters. Their songs were part of his DNA. But that song&mdash;there was something deeper about it that he connected to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That night Jackson told Buz he felt he had to record it some day. &quot;It&#39;s yours when you want it,&quot; Buz said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
