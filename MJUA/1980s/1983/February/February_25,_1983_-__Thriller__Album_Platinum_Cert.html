I mean the music business isn&#39;t exactly going (gangbusters)? and yet you continue to sell records so well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Ehm... Boy... Everytime I get platinum on my album it&#39;s never taken lightly on my behalf. I&#39;m always honoured and it&#39;s great thanks, you know. I&#39;m very happy that public enjoys what I do and I&#39;ll continue to put my heart into my work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: Michael, why is it do you think that you&#39;re able to cross over, when so many albums aren&#39;t able to, from r&#39;n&#39;b to pop. I mean, it&#39;s like a natural to you, you have something within your records that everybody just loves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Boy.. I... I couldn&#39;t say... I just create it and I&#39;m honoured that the public enjoy what I do. I couldn&#39;t explain why, the anatomy, why it happens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: There&#39;s a formula?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Not that I know of. Just my heart. I put my heart in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: You put your heart in it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yeah</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: When you go about writing, what happens?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Ehm... Songs come at the strangest times. I could be walking through a park or something and it just hits you. There&#39;s no set time when I write. They come.. I wrote a song in a concorde, 15000 feet in air and didn&#39;t have a tape recorder so I had to remember it and I got home and put it on tape, so.. they just come.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: Where do you think the gift came from?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: God</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: At this age, you&#39;re 24?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: 30</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: 30?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: no, 24</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: [laughing]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I love performing. I could sleep on a stage, I hate leaving the stage, I was raised on stage and when I&#39;m not on stage I am not as happy and everything seems to be foreign to me. Or new. And I&#39;m just now beginning to enjoy friendship, which is new for me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: Friendship?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Mhm</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: With people other than in showbusiness?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yeah</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: With ladies?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yeah, oh yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: Is there someone very important in your life at this point?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Mhm.. Yes</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: How do you feel and how have you felt over the years about the crowds who, I mean come up on stage and try to get near to you? What goes throug your mind when that happens?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Ehm... That they enjoy what I do and they wanna shake my hand or touch me and ... I think it&#39;s wonderful. If that&#39;s what they wanna do and it&#39;s a good thing and if I&#39;m projecting something that is good I think it&#39;s wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: But at the same time I mean...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Honestly, they don&#39;t hurt me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: But being private kind of person that you are, I mean some people love it, you know. There&#39;s some people love it when the fans just &#39;sshhh&#39; (swoop over)? them..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: no, no, I mean it hurts to be mobbed</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: I bet it does</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Like a (spaghetti)? when a 1000 hands coming at it. Ehm.. I appreciate them enjoying my music and what I do. I guess that&#39;s their way of showing how much they love you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: But is that a difficult time for you? When people come up to you and...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: No, I&#39;ve learned how to handle it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: How is that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Just to be kind to them. And wave at them. Or if they want an autograph, give them an autograph. But security usually take care of anybody who is rough or really wants to pull you or grab you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: Mhm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: you were talking about being on stage, but what is it that goes through your mind when you perform?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Ehm... I don&#39;t think about much... I don&#39;t think at all actually, I&#39;m feeling it. It&#39;s not a thing to thinkin or mechanics, it&#39;s all spirit and feeling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And sometime, every once in a while I think about the next flight, tomorrow&#39;s flight and where we&#39;re gonna be. But it&#39;s really, I&#39;m so much into the music that I don&#39;t think.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: Your music crosses over, you know through all different styles and then other artists haven&#39;t done this before.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Well, I, like I said before, I create right from the heart. There&#39;s no chemistry that I konw of. I just project what I feel. The biggest influence on me was the 60&#39;s. The Motown, and the Beatles, and the Carpenters. And I don&#39;t know if all that had a big influence on me, I&#39;m sure it did, and I just projcet how I feel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I: What&#39;s the very best thing, Michael, that could happen to you in terms of your career?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: To continue. And to continue writing songs and more platinum and triple-platinum and making history and breaking records. I love to, to create and when I&#39;m not creating I&#39;m not as happy. Then I get down and out. I like to stay busy and I&#39;m very thankful.</span></p></body>
