God I&#39;ve learnt so much from him by just sitting in on his sessions and talking to him and listening to... I mean, he&#39;s phenomenal. I mean, I had an interview with George Harrison in England, we did it together, and um, we were speaking of Stevie and he said, this is his exact words, he said Stevie Wonder makes him wanna retire. That&#39;s exactly what he said. He said he just can&#39;t even explain what Stevie does. He said Paul feels the same way he said. He&#39;s just incredible. I mean, I feel the same way about Stevie. I&#39;ll come in the door and he&#39;ll say, &quot;Michael&#39;s here, Michael&#39;s here&quot; (singing Stevie Wonder style), and he&#39;ll come up with a song by saying that. I love Stevie. I learnt so much from him.</span></p></body>
