When we got to the house we were as quiet as mice and he was just really cool and said how he enjoyed our work. After he&#39;d showed us round the house he just let us go off to enjoy ourselves. All the brothers came over, Janet was there, Latoya, Randy, Marlon, Tito, Jermaine, their kids came round, Jane Fonda came and it was nothing but fun.</span></p></body>
