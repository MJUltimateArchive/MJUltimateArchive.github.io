Touches of red have been added for drama along with black mirrored furniture and Tivoli light curtains.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Special touches, reflecting Michael&#39;s personality and achievements, have been added to the suite&#39;s three rooms--two bedrooms and a living room. These highlights include his signature etched in gold on the door; a limited edition cast paper portrait of one of his favorite actresses, Marilyn Monroe, a built-in entertainment center with Laser Disc stereo TV; a replica of an award containing platinum and gold records given to him by the music industry; and an assortment of photos, plaques, and mementos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Garry Cross, general manager of the Hotel Royal Plaza, said Michael said he was so pleased with his suite that he plans to send a larger selection of personal items for decorations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael said he couldn&#39;t believe we knew his tastes so well that we included everything he liked&quot;, Cross said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has been a guest at the Hotel Royal Plaza several times during the past several years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He is a typical tourist when he comes to visit--he&#39;s here for the same reasons as everyone else--to play and enjoy the fantasy&quot;, Cross said. &quot;Everything positive you&#39;ve ever heard about Michael is true.

I had just been selected as a member of the U.S. Culinary Team, a prestigious accomplishment, going on to win three Culinary Olympics gold medals in the world competition, as the first Filipino / Asian American in this elite group of chefs. So who better to cook for Michael at his &quot;second home&quot; than an international awarding winning chef? Mani and I would coordinate menus and product list via fax (no email in those days) so Michael&#39;s frequent visits became &quot;my baby&quot;. Michael visited Disneyland several times over a three period at the height of his career and I was blessed with the opportunity of cooking for the &quot;King of Pop&quot; every time he stayed with us. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Needless to stay, his status commanded the utmost security and care. Many celebrities rent out an entire floor when staying at a hotel, but Michael&#39;s handlers would rent out the entire floor above and the entire floor below Michael&#39;s floor. The logistics in mapping out Michael&#39;s every move were mind-boggling. From developing alternate travel routes to and from his suite, to the elaborate disguises I witnessed laid out in his parlor, to the coordination of his entire meal service. It took amazing effort to get Michael to and from the &quot;Happiest Place on Earth&quot;. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s menus at the time were a bit challenging, as he was a vegetarian and we followed strict guidelines in preparing his meals. Although I would have loved to introduce a few Filipino inspired dishes such as my Okoy, it was all about adhering to Michael&#39;s meal plan. Lot&rsquo;s of fruit smoothies and purees, vegetarian casseroles and sandwiches, and his most favorite dish, tofu and cheese enchiladas with green tomatillo sauce. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With Michael in the hotel, I would &quot;divorce&quot; myself from the day-to-day operations to be on call &ldquo;24/7&rdquo; for Jackson, his entourage and guests. I would set up special storage areas for Michael&#39;s food products, even putting aside equipment, such as blenders utensils, pots and pans designated for &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s food preparation only&rdquo;. I would prepare Michael&#39;s food in our main kitchen as well as in his suite which offered me the opportunity to get a glimpse into his personal life, well, as personal as it could be, with the many handlers and assistants that surrounded him. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I would be in Michael&#39;s suite to prepare his dinners and at times, he would entertain large groups of people. Michael would wander into the kitchen while I was cooking and make comments on &ldquo;how good the food smelled and looked&rdquo;. He would even grab a taste of what I was cooking and comment favorably. It was through these exchanges that I drew my first impressions that Michael was a gentle, serene, and respectful person. He never appeared to be demanding or impressed with himself. These feelings would soon be confirmed in a big way. One evening Michael came to the kitchen, gently grabbed me by the arm and said, &quot;Chef, you&#39;re going to sit down and have dinner with us&quot;. Totally caught off guard by Michael&#39;s thoughtfulness and generosity, I at first declined but Michael persisted and shortly I found myself sitting shyly at the end of the table, stirring food around on my plate, watching the King of Pop have dinner. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After cooking for Michael a number of times, I was asked by family and friends to take a picture with Michael as a keepsake. Never the autograph-seeker, I did not want to impose upon him to ask for a photo or an autograph. But I finally succumbed, realizing that I should that I should somehow document my experiences with Michael. So, during a visit, I got up enough courage to bring a camera to his suite. I kept taking the camera out of my pocket every time I thought the opportunity was right, only to return it due to my own shyness. I realized that Michael would soon be leaving the hotel and this was my chance or I may have to wait until his next visit. As Michael walked toward me in the hallway, he saw me fumbling to get the camera out and again a testament to his kindness, he took all the pressure off by saying, &quot;Let&#39;s take a picture!&quot; as he handed the camera to one of his assistants who snapped the photo. (Image 001) </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s global mega-star image was created by the persona. It was necessary to have the many handlers and assistants, as the demands put upon him were immense, but I feel his persona demanded ultra VIP treatment, not Michael the person. One example that stands out is an occasion where we misplaced Michael&#39;s ice cream. After all-out, property-wide search, it was later found, totally melted. I reluctantly reported this to Jackson&rsquo;s aid, terribly worried because it was Michael&#39;s dessert that evening. The aid returned shortly, calmly saying, &quot;The ice cream is no problem., but can we use your helio-port because we&#39;re going to have a pint of Michael&#39;s favorite ice cream delivered via helicopter for his dinner tonight.&quot; This is the treatment that a mega-star commands, but I think Michael would have easily settled for a fruit cup or another kind of dessert if he knew how much effort it took to get his ice cream. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Upon learning of his passing, my initial reaction was that of shock and disbelief. As the confirmations rolled in one after the other, I began to come to grips that the &quot;World&#39;s Greatest Entertainer&quot; had left us. The television news networks began running videos of Michael&#39;s many performances. And upon hearing Michael&#39;s gentle voice in a sound bite, a lump developed in my throat and my eyes welled up with tears. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson &quot;The World&#39;s Best Ever&quot; was sadly a prisoner of his own fame. And because of this, led a controversial and tumultuous life, leading many to speculate and make assumptions. These impressions are often based on what one sees or hears, but rarely based upon what one really knows. For me, I witnessed Michael&#39;s kindness, serenity, and humility and I did so firsthand, and this is how I will always remember Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/pinoy-migration/07/01/09/fil-am-chef-grieves-over-michael-jacksons-death"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;ABS-CBN&rdquo; (July 1, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718171032/https://news.abs-cbn.com/pinoy-migration/07/01/09/fil-am-chef-grieves-over-michael-jacksons-death"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Gentle and a very kind person&rdquo; was how a Filipino American celebrity chef based in San Diego, California described the music pop legend Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Larry Banares prepared meals for Jackson in the past when the music icon frequently visited Disneyland Hotel where he was then its executive chef during the 80s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I found him to be very serene, gentle and a very kind person,&quot; Banares said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Banares have good memories of Jackson whom he said was a kind and humble person.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One night, we were in a suite cooking and we were preparing a very special meal for him and his entourage and we were really working hard to get the meal out. Michael came out in the kitchen, &lsquo;this smells so good chef, I can&rsquo;t wait to eat&rsquo;. He came back moments later and grabbed me by the arm said &lsquo;chef come on you&#39;re gonna sit down and eat with us&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He recalled carrying a camera at that time but was embarrassed to ask Jackson to have his photo taken with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was just kind of very clumsily handling a camera in my hand, kind of hiding it, a little bit embarrassed to ask him for the photo shoot. He actually saw me holding it, and walked right up to me and said &lsquo;oh great we&#39;re taking a picture!&quot; said Banares.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was vegetarian then, he said, and was following a menu. He recalled that he learned to perfect the singer&rsquo;s favorite food.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One that really sticks in my mind was a kind of a Mexican dish. He loved tofu and cheese enchiladas with the green tomatillo sauce. And we perfected that dish because it was one of Michael&#39;s absolute favorites,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Even in the past, Jackson was already using disguises when going out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What amazed me would be seeing all the different disguises laid out on the tables and the chairs - from wigs to scarves to sunglasses, even masks. And it was interesting because no matter where Michael went, almost immediately he grew a crowd,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like many of Jackson&rsquo;s fans, the singer&rsquo;s death came as a shock to Banares.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was, like many people, in shock. And when I heard his voice, when they play a small clip on an interview, the gentleness of his voice, I was very choked up and in tears,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He, however, takes comfort in knowing that the world is now giving more importance to Jackson&rsquo;s legacy in music and in culture.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Asian Journal&rdquo; (2011-2012) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://mjjfa-blog.tumblr.com/post/21966922533/chef-larry-banares-michael-jacksons-san-diego"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718165546/https://mjjfa-blog.tumblr.com/post/21966922533/chef-larry-banares-michael-jacksons-san-diego"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chef Banares Recalls Cooking for the Late King of Pop Michael Jackson</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the height of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s career in the 1980&rsquo;s, Jackson lived a life of luxury and fantasy as one of the public&rsquo;s most beloved and elusive figures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the very few to witness Jackson during this time was Executive Chef of the Disneyland Hotel, Larry Banares. A Filipino-American and San Diego resident, Banares fondly recalls his memories with the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;From my contact with Michael,&rdquo; Banares said, &ldquo;I never saw anything other than a gentle, serene, respectful person&hellip; I think if Michael had it his way, if there were ten thousand fans waiting for him, he&rsquo;d want to shake everyone&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Banares prepared Jackson&rsquo;s meals while he was a guest at the hotel in the 1980&rsquo;s, after the star released the groundbreaking Thriller album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The son of a Navy man from Iloilo in the Philippines, Banares had also built an impressive resume by that time as a member of the highly competitive United States Culinary Olympic Team. By his mid-twenties, Banares had become Executive Chef of the 1,200-room Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, California.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Superstar Michael Jackson was the hotel&rsquo;s prominent VIP.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Preparing meals for Jackson, who was a Jehovah&rsquo;s witness and strict vegetarian, required meticulous planning that began long before the star even set foot in the hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before Jackson&rsquo;s arrival, Banares would consult with the star&rsquo;s personal chef via phone and fax, detailing menus down to the brand name of the ingredients. Then, Banares would set aside ingredients for Jackson&rsquo;s meals in separate coolers, marked by day, in the hotel kitchen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, despite these preparations, crises still arose. Banares recalls how on one occasion, Jackson&rsquo;s favorite tofu ice cream was left out of the cooler and melted. When he informed Jackson&rsquo;s staff, a new pint of ice cream was immediately brought to the hotel- by helicopter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whenever a major star visited the park, the standard procedure of the hotel was to book one floor for the special guest. But in Jackson&rsquo;s case, three floors of the hotel were set aside: one floor for the star and his entourage, along with the floor above and the floor below.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was Jackson&rsquo;s personable, kind demeanor that Banares remembers the most from their interactions over the course of three years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Banares was putting the finishing touches on meals one evening, Jackson tugged on his arm and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to sit down with us tonight. Come have dinner with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Seated at the end of a long table, Banares joined Jackson and his companions, quietly sharing a meal with the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At first, Banares&rsquo; wife did not believe him when he said that he was cooking for Michael Jackson. When she was finally persuaded, she urged him to get a picture with the megastar. Banares was hesitant, but then brought a camera to work with him. While Jackson was in the next room, Banares pulled the camera out of his breast pocket, contemplating the right moment to ask the star for a photo. Just as he looked up, Jackson was standing in front of him and said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna take a picture, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Banares got the photo and proof for his wife.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His other interactions with Jackson were short and sweet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Banares recalls how Jackson would come into the kitchen and quietly look over his shoulder or steal a bite of food. Jackson approached the chef while he was cooking and said in his soft-spoken voice, &ldquo;Oh chef, that smells so good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But this was a side of Jackson that few were allowed to see. His handlers ensured that he was closely guarded and insulated from the outside world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Banares caught a glimpse of this side of Jackson&rsquo;s life. He entered Jackson&rsquo;s suite when the star was preparing to go out of the hotel. &ldquo;[I] saw all [Jackson&rsquo;s] disguises laid out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Floppy hats and baseball hats and scarves, bandanas, different kinds of sunglasses and wigs- it was incredible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When he went from the hotel to the park, he put on a disguise. It was kind of funny because it made his standout more!&rdquo; Banares laughed, &ldquo;He&rsquo;d wear these ridiculous wigs with four or five guys around him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">These measures, Banares observed, did seem to match with the approachable individual that he knew.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I think Michael wore [his persona] because it allowed him to do what he wanted, which was to perform,&rdquo; Banares says, &ldquo;but really, I think he was very uncomfortable with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Jackson made arrangements to visit Disneyland, three members of the hotel staff were first informed: the General Manager, the Director of Security, and the Executive Chef. They worked closely with Jackson&rsquo;s handlers. While the Director of Security was discussing the layout of the hotel (including the back entrances and underground tunnel systems) with Jackson&rsquo;s security detail, Banares would plan the menu and details of the accommodations with Jackson&rsquo;s personal chef.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Every three to four months, we&rsquo;d go through the same thing [when Michael came to Disneyland], which made it very easy,&rdquo; Banares said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Jackson&rsquo;s visits, which totaled eight or nine over the course of three years according to Banares, would mark a change in routine at the international hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With Jackson as a guest, Banares &ldquo;divorced&rdquo; himself from hotel operations after making the necessary preparations for the 175 workers under his charge. Banares would sleep at the hotel and remained on call 24/7.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to the VH1 program &ldquo;The Fabulous Life of Michael Jackson,&rdquo; employing Banares as chef cost the star $2,000 a day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s favorite meal was vegetarian enchiladas with tofu, cheese and green tomatillo sauce, Banares told San Diego&rsquo;s Channel 10 News.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since his days at the Disneyland Hotel, Banares has hosted bi-weekly cooking segments on Channel 10 and 15 and his half-hour program, &ldquo;Chef Larry&rsquo;s Cuisine.&rdquo; Banares also hosts a radio program that is broadcast throughout San Diego. Banares served on the US Culinary Olympic team in 1992, 1996, and 1998, earning three gold medals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In addition to cooking for Michael Jackson, Banares has also cooked for Lea Salonga, Imelda Marcos, the Sultan of Brunei, and Philippine Presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Joseph Estrada.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Banares learned of Jackson&rsquo;s death, he took the news as a fan and admirer. &ldquo;[I&rsquo;m] sad for the loss, but also kind of happy because for someone who was so huge, I was allowed into his world for a bit,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">George Atwell, staff producer at Bee Jay Studios, &ldquo;Orlando Sentinel&rdquo; (June 26, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090707103853/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2009/06/george-atwell-recorded-with-michael-jackson-in-orlando.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">George Atwell is the organist and composer-in-residence at the First Presbyterian Church of Orlando.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back in the day, though, he was a musician at Orlando&#39;s Bee Jay Studios, where he had the opportunity to record demos with Michael Jackson on one of his trips to Central Florida.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Atwell was kind enough to send along his recollections in an email that I will post below. he says that Jackson impressed him with his professionalism, his ability to perform musically with precision, his kindness and his childlike enthusiasm.

He says the elevator was ringing all night, as the curious traveled upstairs to possibly get a look at the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We&#39;ll let Atwell take it from here:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; was released and had become so hugely popular, Michael Jackson came to Orlando on vacation and through mutual musician friends in LA and Orlando, he asked us to help him do 4 demos of songs that were in his head. I was staff producer at Bee Jay Recording studios in Orlando at the time, and we gathered up keyboards, Linn Drum machine, guitar, and bass and the 4 of us met him at the Royal Plaza hotel (on the 13</span><span class="csD5D7D290"><sup>th </sup></span><span class="csD5D7D290">floor). He was extremely nice, polite, and concerned that we were OK&hellip;..not too tired, do you want any food, etc. He was endorsing Pepsi at the time and the first thing we saw in the sink were 3 large Pepsi bottles&hellip;..a true endorsee! Since Michael didn&rsquo;t read music, he took each of us one by one, into a work/music room and went over each part until he got what he wanted to hear. He would sing the part and we&rsquo;d play it back and then modify it, change voicings, chord structures, etc. until he&rsquo;d say: &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Incidentally, there was a guard seated outside his room and while we were working into the wee hours, we could hear the elevator ring all night as fans tried to come up and get a glimpse of Michael. They would try to bribe the guard with anything (use your imagination!) to let them in, but he, of course wouldn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In this way we worked out the tunes at the hotel; then took everything to the recording studio, where we laid down all the tracks and he would then sing over them. The thing I remember most about those sessions, was the fact that vocally, he never missed! The only time they had to roll the tape back was if the engineer was late on a punch in or something technical went wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He sang the lead vocals and all 3 background vocal parts, stacking them 3 times each and never missed. He didn&rsquo;t go to the piano and work out the vocal backgrounds (as is usually done), but simply pulled the parts out of the air! The incredible &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and sense of rhythm of his &ldquo;finger snaps&rdquo; while he was doing the &ldquo;guide tracks&rdquo; for us to work from is forever indelible in my brain. There was a very precise &ldquo;groove spot&rsquo; in relation to the beat that only he seemed to know how to find. At the studio, we all sat in the TV lounge and watched the premiere of &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; on MTV. He was just like a little kid&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t believe this video was playing on MTV, couldn&rsquo;t believe &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; the album, was #1 on the charts&hellip;.and this after his many #1 hits in his career up until that time (he was 24). </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I asked him why he didn&rsquo;t learn to read music and he replied: God had given him this gift and he was afraid that learning too much about the intellectual side of music would mess it up.&rdquo; He had a traveling companion, an elderly gentleman that he said had been with him for 16 years, and loved to tease him and play jokes on him if he fell asleep, etc. He received daily edits of the Thriller video from LA and we watched them together. The first time, he had us all gather around the TV, got popcorn, and snacks, drinks, etc. ready and when he played the tape he found to his horror that a house guest had taped the 11:00 news over the video! He was so embarrassed and kept saying how sorry he was, and he couldn&rsquo;t see how this could happen, etc., so he invited all back to see it the next night. He thought the world of John Landis and Quincy Jones, though he did say he and Quincy got into it because Quincy didn&rsquo;t want &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; on the album&hellip;didn&rsquo;t think the tune was strong enough or something. Well, we all know who prevailed on that issue!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We have very fond memories of that time... [Michael] was a truly caring and wonderful person to be around. My son, Michael (who played and programmed the Linn Drum machine) was 14 at the time and this was his very first paying recording session&hellip;&hellip;..what a way to start your resume! We have great pictures with him and of course an autographed copy of &ldquo;Thriller.&rdquo; He pointed out to us the tendons bulging in his arm from having to hold the baby tiger so tight because it was biting the heck out of him!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2009-06-26-michael-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Orlando Sentinel&rdquo; (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200108171559/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2009-06-26-michael-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the prime of his solo career, the Michael Jackson of Thriller and &quot;Beat It&quot; retreated to a public place that he made into his private fantasy land: Walt Disney World.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson... made the Magic Kingdom his second home in the mid-1980s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Working at Disney during that time was almost like being a member of Jackson&#39;s extended family. He was like the rich, eccentric uncle who used to pull into town at the most unexpected moments.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was one of those Disney employees then. In that job, and later as a journalist, I was lucky enough to ever-so-briefly encounter one of the planet&#39;s iconic stars at two distinctive points in his arc.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...When I was piloting a boat between Disney hotels, Jackson sightings sparked a minor commotion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson would be spotted on Bay Lake in a float boat with TV actor Emmanuel Lewis. Or he&#39;d be seen in one of those secret underground tunnels, checking out the intricacies of the Disney magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The ultimate sign of his devotion was the famous Michael Jackson suite in the Royal Plaza hotel at Lake Buena Vista. My boat-pilot pals and I used to hoist beers in the Giraffe Lounge downstairs. He never joined us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Four years ago, I revisited memories of the Jackson suite in writing a story about Orlando&#39;s bygone musical landmarks. Phil Wright, general manager of the Royal Plaza during the Jackson era, recalled the four-room suite in detail:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The twinkling lights in the ceiling. The trophy case insured for $1 million. The Marilyn Monroe collectibles and (then) state-of-the-art laser-disc player equipped with lights that sparkled to the beat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wright remembered that Jackson&#39;s pet chimp, Bubbles, liked to flush the toilet. &quot;He liked to hear it gurgle.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He recalled the singer fondly, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I knew him at the hotel, he was kind, generous and unbelievably shy,&quot; Wright said. &quot;We wanted to offer a place where he could feel at home.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My own Jackson memories could be characterized in one word: silence.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Picking up tickets for a cast holiday party once, I happened upon Jackson strolling Disney&#39;s cast-services building. In a lime-green sweater and fedora, he was wordlessly looking at scale models of the park attractions as a small crowd of employees gathered silently around him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It went on for about 20 minutes, no one saying anything, until Jackson walked back to his white limo, turned and silently waved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was odd.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Flash-forward to the early 1990s, and I&#39;m again face to face. The Sentinel had sent me, as a cub reporter, to follow Jackson and pal Macaulay Culkin around what is now Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios for the day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The TV crews and I hustled around the park in a vain attempt to engage the King of Pop in conversation. When he suddenly emerged from a backstage entrance, I asked the first thing that came to mind:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;How you doing?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was an idiotic question. I think he said &quot;Fine,&quot; but all I can really tell you is that his lips moved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And so it went for the rest of the afternoon. Run, stop, stare. I must have written something, but it wasn&#39;t laden with expressive quotes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yet I&#39;m still talking about it.</span></p></body>
