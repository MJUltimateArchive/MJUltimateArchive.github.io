At a party that Paul and his wife Linda were hosting, Michael recalls walking in the door and having Linda tell him that she and Paul had a song for him. &quot;They just started singing to me right there on the spot&quot;, Michael says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since his brothers had moved out of the family home in Encino, Calif., Michael was writing more by himself and, as &quot;Off the Wall&quot; showed, developing his own separate musical persona.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I try to do it my way&quot;, he said. &quot;To copy somebody else&#39;s song would make me feel guilty and cheap. It really would. Writing lyrics takes me a long time, but writing melodies, I love. I make them up all the time. Most of the time, I write on drums and piano, but I really wish I could play guitar well.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
