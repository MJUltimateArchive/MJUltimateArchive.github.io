Michael really wanted to do the song because he identified so much with its message. He often feels like a fish in a bowl - always being watched by people wanting a piece of him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-rockwells-paranoid-classic-somebodys-watching-me-w445172"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">, 2016</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Enlisting Jackson to sing the hook sounds like classic label maneuvering, a way to help out the unknown artist with a heavyweight co-sign. But the truth is more organic: Jackson was six years older than Rockwell, with the latter often spending his childhood days at the Jacksons&#39; home. The fledgling songwriter went to the Jackson residence to show the family what he&#39;d been recording. After bringing in a boombox with a demo cassette of the song, the nervous singer performed over the music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I performed it about eight or nine times,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Michael says, &#39;Hey Rebbie! Hey Janet! You gotta hear this song Kennedy did.&#39; Every time we stopped the song, Michael called three more people down. Afterwards, Michael pulled me to the side and says, &#39;Kennedy, I gotta talk to you for a second. Who are you going to get to sing background vocals?&#39; I said, &#39;Why don&#39;t you do it?&#39; It worked just like that.&quot; Jermaine Jackson would also end up contributing to the final track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/140820641/"><span class="cs8567212B">St. Louis Post</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (May 11, 1984)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s Michael Jackson who sings the infectious chorus. Rockwell claims that the guest appearance was Jackson&#39;s idea. &quot;Michael and I are friends, we spend time together,&quot; he explains. &quot;He heard the song one day and said, &lsquo;That&#39;s great. Wait a minute. LaToya!&#39; Next thing I knew, the whole family was there, listening. Then he&#39;s asking me who&#39;s going to be singing on the record.&quot; The lyrics, Rockwell admits, are a bit autobiographical. When he went places with his father, he says, &quot;People would know, and there&#39;d be a big concern. I couldn&#39;t just walk away. There&#39;d be a lot of security around. It&#39;s always been, &#39;Be very careful who your friends are. Don&#39;t bring anybody you don&#39;t think is really cool to the house. And when you go out places, don&#39;t try to show off who you are. Don&#39;t flash money. You don&#39;t want unnecessary attention on you.&#39; It was very hard for me to go out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808111916/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/wanna5.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown newspaper article</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Putting it another way, what was it like working with Michael and Jermaine Jackson? &quot;Well, we&#39;re really good friends--I&#39;ve known them since I was very young. We&#39;ve stayed friends through the years whatever. We decided to get together one day, Michael had heard I was working on some music and he wanted to hear what I was doing. I played him a tape and one of the songs that seemed to stick out was &quot;Somebody&#39;s Watching Me&quot;--it was actually the last song I played him. He was really excited about it--he loved it, you know. He called down just about every member of his family to come and hear this song, one after the other.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Before I knew what was happening, I must have played that song about ten times, because their family is really big, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He wanted to know if I had anybody in mind for background vocals. I said I&#39;d probably do it. That&#39;s when Michael says, &quot;Look, I&#39;ll do it!&quot;. And then the next thing I know, Jermaine is saying, &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot;, and then Randy&#39;s saying &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot;, and then Randy&#39;s saying, &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot;. It was really amazing, man.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sounds unbearably saccharine--the Wonderful World of Motown; picture the happy troupe hip-hopping their way down to Hitsville with gay abandon. &quot;Gee Rock, your song&#39;s so great, and together, we&#39;ll make the world a better place&quot;, says Michael. &quot;Awww shucks&quot;, replies Rock.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael missed the first recording session &ndash; he was at a theme park with one-time teen rival, Donny Osmond. The following evening, Michael recorded his vocals in just over an hour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Also at Frager&rsquo;s Mars studio was brother Randy Jackson.</span></p></body>
