Michael, I understand that you&rsquo;re a lover of animals. Is that true?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, very true. We&rsquo;d tour in the past. We&rsquo;d go to different countries and different states and I&rsquo;d go to the different zoos all over the world to see the different animals&hellip; I can relate to them and I love them better than I can name.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Like people?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is it also true, is there a mini Michael Jackson zoo on the grounds of your house?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;zoo&rsquo; but I have several animals here. I&rsquo;m still collecting animals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What kinds of animals?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do I have?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh huh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I have a llama which is a beautiful animal. He&rsquo;s taller than I am, he&rsquo;s from Peru, South America, yeah and he was in the circus. His name is Louie. He&rsquo;s really sweet and loves people and he does tricks and I have a mouflon sheep. He looks just like a ram. Most people think he&rsquo;s a ram but he isn&rsquo;t. He was also in the circus, they were raised together. His name is Mr. Tibbs. I have an almost six foot boa-constrictor. His name is Muscles and I take him to the studio. Diana Ross was just here and we were both peeling his skin off, you know, cause he peels like three times a month. And&hellip; she was a little afraid of him but then she got relaxed with him and&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> She touched him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, yeah!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, really?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. And I have two deer. Their name is Prince and Princess. They&rsquo;re really sweet, they&rsquo;re the North American white-tailed deer and&hellip; I raised them from the bottle. They&rsquo;re really sweet. And I&rsquo;ve got several, all kind of different birds and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you have a favorite?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Animal?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh huh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; probably Louie and Prince and Princess.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ok. You&rsquo;re considered the number one artist in the world. What&rsquo;s your secret, Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; just loving what I do and speaking from the heart, being honest, really. Umm&hellip; I can&rsquo;t quite form it down to a special formula or anything. It&rsquo;s uh&hellip;It&rsquo;s just wanting to do great work, you know, and doing it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And I guess loving what you do has a lot to do with it too&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, caring and loving and putting your heart in your work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Honesty, is that very important to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, yeah, very important. I mean there is nothing like writing a song that you feel good about like &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; and &ldquo;Startin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo;&rdquo;, stuff like that&hellip; And you feel like you have a great prize, you know, when it&rsquo;s done &lsquo;cause you had to work hard on them&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ok. So there&hellip; I guess you&rsquo;re talking about the honesty I would know would be like honesty in everyday life, but you&rsquo;re talking about honesty in musical terms, being true to yourself and trying to get that out on the album</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Your audiences expect new and exciting things from you each time you release an album. Do the high standards get harder or easier to live up to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, they get harder, because no matter what your do, it&rsquo;s&hellip; you&rsquo;re competing against your previous product and everybody&rsquo;s expecting more. It&rsquo;s like with a motion picture. You go to see &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Empire Strikes Back&rdquo;, you expect more than&hellip; Jedi, you expect more than that so you&rsquo;re really trying to top yourself all the time. And it&rsquo;s hard. I mean with the Bee Gees with &lsquo;Saturday Night Fever&rsquo; they&hellip; and then they came out with &lsquo;Spirits Having Flown&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s really hard, you know. But I believe in doing better work. As you grow you should get better, you know. It&rsquo;s like that saying: &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m getting older, I&rsquo;m getting better&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, trying to top, you know, your albums, is it draining, personally and physically?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, it&rsquo;s a challenge. It&rsquo;s fun. It&rsquo;s like a big&hellip; I shouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;game&rsquo; but I have a lot of fun doing it. It&rsquo;s really&hellip; to get paid for something you love to do is really a treat &lsquo;cause a lot of people are employed and they hate their work, it&rsquo;s terrible. But I&rsquo;m getting paid for something that I love to do. So it&rsquo;s a lot of fun, I&rsquo;m just having a ball.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Now, you stated that you feel more comfortable on the stage than any other time. What do you do for excitement once you are off that stage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Dream about the stage &ndash; play with my animals, stuff like that. I don&rsquo;t really go any places at all. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d find me at the disco or nightclub. All these places are fun if that&rsquo;s what you like to do. It&rsquo;s just when I go to places like that it becomes work instead of pleasure. They announce that I&rsquo;m there over the loudspeakers and they play all my records and I&rsquo;m signing autographs and&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &hellip; and again you are on stage!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, so it&rsquo;s not fun. I&rsquo;ve done disguises and all kinds of things and it just doesn&rsquo;t work. But it&rsquo;s, you know, it&rsquo;s all right, I don&rsquo;t mind it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well for me, to mellow out, I call it mellowing out, I read or play Bid Whist. For you is it the animals again as you were saying?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, probably the animals or.. being with children which I love a lot. I love kids, the young ones and I play with them, swim and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;ve been in the music business since age 5 or 6. What do you think your life would have been like if you hadn&rsquo;t had the talent to sing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Boy, I can&rsquo;t imagine, really. I have no idea what I&rsquo;d be doing. Because this is&hellip; seems so right for me and I&rsquo;m here to do this and&hellip; it&rsquo;s my contribution to life, to do what I&rsquo;m doing and I put my heart in it. And whatever good I can do, I do it &lsquo;cause I love people and I love making them happy. There&rsquo;s nothing like seeing your record number one not for the ego &lsquo;cause I&hellip; I hate ego. It&rsquo;s for the fact that I know people bought it and they loved it and they enjoy it and that&rsquo;s good. And I think all those people who&hellip; I mean I can turn out great music but it takes the people behind a tour, the disc jockeys and the program directors, all the independent people to really make it happen and I appreciate it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So are you saying: Michael Jackson aged 60 still on stage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; Yes&hellip;Umm&hellip; I&rsquo;d probably be doing writing and film, probably directing and stuff like that. Still active but a little more behind the scenes, developing other people and showing them which direction to go in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> With success in show-business, you stated earlier that your privacy is almost lost. How do you deal with going out? Have you just stopped going out altogether afraid of having your picture taken or people asking for autographs? Have you found a way to beat all of that and still maintain a private life outside of your home?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; Well, the best privacy is kinda within yourself and to be independent at home or something&hellip; &lsquo;cause everything I wanna do is here. I can do whatever I want here, you know. It&rsquo;s loose and free. But if I go out somewhere it&rsquo;s different. You get swarmed by lots of autographs and people, which&hellip; I don&rsquo;t mind signing autographs, it&rsquo;s fine. It&rsquo;s&hellip; you know, part of the work that I do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are you considering taking off for a few years, maybe a year. Just smell the roses, just be totally selfish as far as taking time out from Michael Jackson with no recording , movies, or any such show-business related things &ndash; will you ever do that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;m the kind of person if I take a week off I feel I&rsquo;m loafin&rsquo;, you know, I feel like I&rsquo;m getting behind. I&hellip; I like being active. I like to create. I&rsquo;m constantly coming up with different songs and different ideas, looking and prying into the future, the sound of tomorrow. And uh&hellip; &lsquo;cause the music is constantly changing, minute by minute, and it&rsquo;s important not be became old hat, it&rsquo;s an old expression.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, but some of your recordings are considered classics. Will they ever became old hat?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, because to me a great melody will never become old. The most important thing is great melodies, some of the old Motown or the old Beatles songs are just phenomenal and they&rsquo;ll never became old hat. But the sounds and the music change and that will become old &ndash; the sound like the instruments. Like in the Sixties there was a lot of electric guitar and acoustic guitar and now it&rsquo;s all computerized, synthesized sound, which has completely taken over and that&rsquo;s different. But the melodies are still there, but the music has changed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh I see what you&rsquo;re saying. You said you love kids. You qualified it by saying very young kids. But what about marriage and then maybe some kids? How far down the line is it, Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I have no idea. I have no idea. I can&rsquo;t answer that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ok. I won&rsquo;t bother you on that. Any TV specials on the work? Say, something you&rsquo;d like to do on television?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; None that I know of. I get all kinds of different offers all the time from specials to my own series, to doing cameos to pilots, to cartoon series and all kinds of things. And I&rsquo;m mainly concerned with doing movies right now and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m interested in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What kind of movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; something that&rsquo;s really different and exciting. Uhh&hellip; Something that hasn&rsquo;t been seen before. I mean it&rsquo;s like what &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; was to the whole picture industry. All of a sudden there was a whole another look, a whole new type of movie making, creatures that walk in space instead of on earth and&hellip; it&rsquo;s kind a taking it to a whole another way of&hellip; to where it is now&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; one of your favorite movies?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, and E.T.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> E.T?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> All right. Call home, E.T. To Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, Steven Spielberg is just brilliant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Your creativity it seems is carried out like in all aspects of your life. In music, you&rsquo;re very futuristic, you&rsquo;re really looking to the future and planning for that. And even in movies you want something that has never been before.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh huh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And, I was trying, in my mind, trying to think of what kind of movie would that be. It would be&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. Could you sort of paint me a picture of something that would be the first of its kinds for movies?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip; I&rsquo;d sure would love to do that. There&rsquo;s tons of scripts that are coming&hellip; Since I did &ldquo;The Wiz&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s been tons of scripts come in and&hellip; With a movie, you know. It&rsquo;s so important to be selective, to do the right vehicle that&rsquo;s perfect for you. And I really enjoy surprising the public, going in a whole another direction to what they thought and there&rsquo;s several different projects that I&rsquo;m really interested in but I&rsquo;d really hate to say what it&rsquo;s about &lsquo;cause I really wanna take a different turn and surprise people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Not just one glimpse, or one peek&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;ll be some&hellip; guys, futuristic and&hellip; it&rsquo;ll be very different. That&rsquo;s all I can say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ok. So basically that&rsquo;s the key word &lsquo;different&rsquo; for Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You stated &quot;The Eagles&quot; is a favorite group of yours. Did the group&rsquo;s &quot;Hotel California&quot; inspire your &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; or &quot;Thriller&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was a stimulant for Rod Temperton to write Thriller. &lsquo;Cause he told me how much he loved &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, with all the sounds, and the falling, and the sound effects. I was trying to step into the future with that &ldquo;Heartbreak Hotel&rdquo;, trying something different, integrating drama and sound effects with music. And it worked. &lsquo;Cause a lot of people are trying that whole thing, like Pink Floyd and even Rod Temperton with Thriller. And so many other people are coming out with sounds in their records now.. different effects, that&rsquo;s fine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So it was like a pilot and also a prototype of what&rsquo;s happening now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh huh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Has a tentative date been set for a Jacksons tour with Jermaine and Janet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well we&rsquo;re&hellip; probably sometime after this summer. But we really, really haven&rsquo;t pinpointed any dates yet. So we&rsquo;re really not sure, and the other&hellip; as far as Janet and Jermaine are concerned&hellip; we haven&rsquo;t really talked about that yet. We have talked about Jermaine, but if we do it, it&rsquo;ll be a surprise so I can&rsquo;t really answer yes or no. And sometimes he&rsquo;s unpredictable, so he may say &ldquo;well I decided to go and take it easy and rest somewhere,&rdquo; &lsquo;cause he changes his mind so quickly. Last time I heard , he said he was moving on an island, which he was going to buy, and now he moved somewhere else. And then, he was into boats and then he changed, so he&#39;s always changing. So I really can&rsquo;t answer for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do the accolades gold and platinum records and awards still excite and inspire Michael Jackson to keep going on?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They&rsquo;ll always excite me, the gold and the platinum. It&rsquo;s just important not to take it too serious and not to reflect too much on the past and too much on the gold and too much&hellip; because you&rsquo;ll get bogged down&hellip; with your achievements instead of pulling out great work. Instead of your past work&hellip; you can get lost in that, really. Sometime I put all of my gold and platinum records out and I&rsquo;ll look at them, and then I try not to take it too serious. Because there&rsquo;s so much more I have to do. You kind of forget about that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is it hard to forget about that though? About the spotlight, the superstardom. I mean your name probably is up there with Muhammad Ali, or higher. You&rsquo;re known everywhere. As you said, you can&rsquo;t go outside. Everybody knows Michael Jackson. Is it hard not to take yourself seriously?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Umm&hellip;no, it&rsquo;s pretty easy for me because uh, so many things I block out. I so much see myself like you or like the people in this room. I&rsquo;m human just like you are. I&rsquo;m no better than you are. I maybe have a certain talent, with my art and songwriting and dancing and the drama and the whole thing&hellip; the show business thing, but as far as human, I&rsquo;m just like you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> An average person?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, so it&rsquo;s no right for me to think I&rsquo;m better than you, or have an ego, or to walk on air, because there are lots of people in my field who are like that, and most of those people, they fall. They really do, because they begin to treat the people who helped them badly, and to forget where they came from, and to forget about those who helped them get where they are, and that&rsquo;s real important. That&rsquo;s why I thank all of those. I thank everybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So in reality you&rsquo;re protecting yourself from that fall by just being average and human.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I don&rsquo;t believe in failure actually, so I just don&rsquo;t even think about it. I take that completely out of my vocabulary, the word &lsquo;fail&rsquo;, because I don&rsquo;t believe in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is that part of the upbringing? To be goal-oriented and also not to believe or even say the word &lsquo;failure&rsquo;? Is that something you were taught by your mom and dad?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well I&rsquo;ve been taught a lot by them &ndash; my father, my mother &ndash; how to train and to be determined and to do this and that, but it&rsquo;s just something I strongly believe in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Alright. We said five or six years old in the business, in show business. Do you sometime feel that you wish you could return maybe and take your childhood and look at it and treat it a little bit differently? Because basically, did you pass childhood, and did you feel you were thrust into an adult world?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Um, well it was pretty different being brought up on stage and on tour and it&rsquo;s not like the ordinary child life. So it is different. I mean I enjoyed doing it, it was nothing like I had stage parents who shoved me into something I didn&rsquo;t want to do. It wasn&rsquo;t that. If it was that, I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve made it this long. I would&rsquo;ve probably overdosed or something. But I enjoy it, no I&hellip; it&rsquo;s a love that I have. It&rsquo;s nothing like being on stage, it&rsquo;s&hellip; you can&rsquo;t put it in words. When the lights hit you, it&rsquo;s a certain spirit you feel, and uh, I just don&rsquo;t like coming off. That&rsquo;s the truth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> 24 hours on stage&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh huh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;d take 24 hours on stage if you could get it, huh?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh huh, uh huh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So you don&rsquo;t regret one&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Not one minute. Not one minute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;ve been slated to portray Peter Pan. When&rsquo;s the projected movie release date?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Uh, that&rsquo;s being developed right now and that is a project I&rsquo;m interested in. And I&rsquo;ve been approached by different people to do the film, and I haven&rsquo;t really said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; yet. I haven&rsquo;t seen the script yet. So they&rsquo;re going ahead, and I&rsquo;m waiting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And you&rsquo;ll let me know, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ok. I identify you as strictly a black musical genius. However you have much broader appeal than that. Do you find it hard to appeal to both black and white audiences at the same time while performing, or do you even consider the black or white aspect?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No. I don&rsquo;t think in terms of color or race. Or&hellip; I don&rsquo;t say when I write a song &ldquo;this is for the blacks and this one&rsquo;s for the whites&hellip;&rdquo; I just write and it comes out, and I&rsquo;m influenced by what I hear. And it just comes out that way, I guess since I was small up to now. It&rsquo;s a total sum musically of what I&rsquo;ve been raised on. And I don&rsquo;t think in terms of color. Because I don&rsquo;t believe in that, I really don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So you&rsquo;re saying music is colorless.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;s colorless, it&rsquo;s for everybody. It&rsquo;s for the world. It&rsquo;s for everybody to enjoy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> As an entertainer, Michael, and also a superstar, you&rsquo;re always in the limelight, but is it hard to keep a &lsquo;black&rsquo; perspective, and this is not on a musical level, but on a Michael Jackson private level. Is it hard to look back and remember your roots?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No&hellip; never hard. All I have to do is look in the mirror. That&rsquo;s all I have to do, or look at my hands.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Ok. You have the opportunity at this point to, I guess to say anything you would like to your fans. What would you say if you have the opportunity?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I&rsquo;d like to say uh&hellip; there&rsquo;s only one word I could say, thank you, and I love you. This is Michael Jackson, and you&rsquo;re listening to:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Diane Collins with Michael Jackson.</span></p></body>
