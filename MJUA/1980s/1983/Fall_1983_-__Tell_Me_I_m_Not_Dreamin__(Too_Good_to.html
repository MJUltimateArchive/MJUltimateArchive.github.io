		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Tell Me I&#39;m Not Dreamin&#39; (Too Good to Be True)&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date confirmed in Jermaine Jackson&rsquo;s autobiography &ldquo;You Are Not Alone&rdquo; (&ldquo;I called him in the fall of [1983] to invite him to do a duet.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jermaine Jackson, &ldquo;You Are Not Alone&rdquo; autobiography</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In my mind, I am re-listening to a tape, and it is Michael&rsquo;s unmistakable voice. He&rsquo;s talking to himself. &ldquo;You are confident . . . You are strong . . . You are beautiful . . . You are the greatest,&rdquo; he repeats. He is meditative and alone, speaking in a tone as soft as the lightest breath. I hear it today as clearly as I did back then; one of Michael&rsquo;s morning meditations in the eighties, a mantra captured on a voice recorder so he could play it back as a pep-talk to himself. He was like a sportsman in the dressing room before stepping into the public arena on a must-win day, eradicating any doubt or fear of failure. With Michael setting out to conquer the music world, he needed to be mentally strong. I don&rsquo;t know if it was a technique handed down by Muhammad Ali, but &ldquo;the greatest&rdquo; suggests to me that it was, as an extension of our training: think it, see it, believe it, make it happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I first heard this mantra in [1983], in the studio with Michael, when we recorded a song called &ldquo;Tell Me I&rsquo;m Not Dreaming.&rdquo; We&rsquo;d been talking about negativity and he said something about controlling our thoughts, adding, &ldquo;Listen to this.&rdquo; If he were still alive, he would probably cringe at my sharing this because it was a very private ritual. But if his legacy is about the empowerment of others with his music or wisdom, then I think this insight is appropriate because it shows that Michael Jackson&mdash;the King of Pop, the greatest entertainer&mdash;was human, too. It says that his self-esteem needed a kick up the butt just like anyone else&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Whenever Michael sat down with his pad and pencil, he was always looking at how the video was going to be at the same time. He wrote visually&mdash;finding the image or scene in his head, then applying the words. He loved what he did because he felt it was such a magical, spiritual process. As he said, around this time in 1983, &ldquo;I just love to create magic. I love to put something together that&rsquo;s so unusual, so unexpected, that it blows people&rsquo;s heads off.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Which was exactly what I was thinking when I called him in the fall of that year to invite him to do a duet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&rsquo;t know that I had completely given up on sharing a studio again with Michael, but I&rsquo;d reached the point of thinking it highly improbable. Especially after his career-defining Thriller album. But sometimes it takes just one thought and phone call to change everything. &ldquo;Tell Me I&rsquo;m Not Dreaming&rdquo; was written for my d&eacute;but album with Arista, Jermaine Jackson, and my co-writers Michael Omartian and Bruce Sudan&mdash;Donna Summers&rsquo; husband&mdash;helped create a slamming track. The moment I started humming the melody, I knew exactly whose voice was needed for this duet. &ldquo;I have a new song . . . and it&rsquo;s perfect for me and you,&rdquo; I told Michael on the phone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He had no problem coming to the studio, even if he hadn&rsquo;t properly understood what was required. &ldquo;Am I singing on this? Or doing backgrounds?&rdquo; he asked. I don&rsquo;t know many &ldquo;super-stars&rdquo; who&rsquo;d ask such a question after showing up. I had made sure that no one was there but me, him and an engineer to push the buttons. After Thriller, the last thing he needed was a bunch of eyes staring at him, so the fewer people the better.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The moment we got to work and he heard the instrumental, he was dancing. &ldquo;I love this . . . I love the sound of this,&rdquo; he said, holding the earphones to his head with both hands. What struck me most about that recording session was how well we knew our way around the studio and console. The last time we&rsquo;d recorded together, in 1975, we were surrounded by a team, being told what to do. Now, there we were, as fully-fledged producers. Just the two of us. We talked about those good old days and how green we were, and we joked and laughed about memories, almost forgetting that we were there to record. But there was that clock again, reminding us that we only had one afternoon to get this done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I laid down my verse and he produced me, then vice versa. After that we traded ad-libs, singing into our individual mics, across the floor from one another. &ldquo;I think this has got No. 1 written all over it,&rdquo; I said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s going to outsell &lsquo;Thriller&rsquo;?&rdquo; he teased. &ldquo;What if it does, Jermaine? What if it does?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Maybe I should write it on my mirror.&rdquo; Michael liked that. &ldquo;The sales don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; I added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy that you&rsquo;re singing this with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&rsquo;s why that record remains special: because it was a personal collaboration between Michael and me. Ultimately, the song was never released as a single in its own deserved right. There was a big conference call between our labels that we both listened in on. Sony didn&rsquo;t want him on a song that would, they said, conflict with his own new releases. I think Michael wanted to help a brother. I think Sony was never going to lift a finger to help Arista with a song featuring its artist. When you&rsquo;re tied up in recording contracts, brothers helping brothers is not an argument. Not that the wily Clive Davis was going to be outdone and I always knew he&rsquo;d find a way of getting it out there. &ldquo;Tell Me I&rsquo;m Not Dreaming&rdquo; became the poor-relation B-side to my later hit &ldquo;Do What You Do&rdquo; because, that way, it didn&rsquo;t classify as an official release.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I lived with the setback because the amount of air play that song received confirmed my instinct: it was a deserved No. 1 in everything but name. Anyway, there was increasing talk in the family of doing a reunion tour as brothers. First, the studio. Then, maybe, the stage. It sounded too good to be true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, &ldquo;Michael Jackson: For the Record&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I co-wrote it with Michael Omartian and Jake Ruska,&rsquo; said Bruce Sudano. &lsquo;We were working on Jermaine&rsquo;s record. Michael Omartian was producing the album for Jermaine. Michael and I became friends when he produced Donna (Summer)&rsquo; s album, &ldquo;She Works Hard for the Money&rdquo;, and we had co-written a couple of songs for that album. Michael had a track that Jermaine liked, and if I wanted to write something, it would probably get on the record.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Jermaine took the song and played it for his brother, Michael Jackson, who also liked it and it became a duet. Jermaine released it as his first single, radio went nuts about the song, and then Jermaine&rsquo;s record company got a call from Michael Jackson&rsquo;s record company, with a &ldquo;Sist and Desist&rdquo; from playing the song. Michael&rsquo;s BAD album was coming out and the company thought it would hinder Michael&rsquo;s new release.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine concurred: &lsquo;A lack of communication between Clive Davis and CBS meant Arista were forbidden to issue the track as a single,&rsquo; explained Jermaine. &lsquo;Basically, CBS were saying, why should we help you sell one of your albums?&rsquo;</span></p></body>
