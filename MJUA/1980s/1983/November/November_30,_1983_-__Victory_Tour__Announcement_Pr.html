		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Victory Tour&quot; Announcement Press Conference</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Black Beat&quot; magazine (March 1984)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He has successfully promoted fights with such boxing greats Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Ken Norton. Now, this friend of Joe and Katherine Jackson, has taken on a new avenue of entertainment and will be the sole promoter of the Jackson Tour. And from his long-winded speech and animated spirits that day, it became evident just how overjoyed he was to be part of this project. Said King of his latest business venture, &quot;...The Jacksons are the best there is. Not only are they the greatest in the music business, but they are the greatest group of people I&#39;ve ever had the privilege of working with. Each of the Jacksons brings his own special talent and personality to the group as a whole. After ten years of promoting some of the great athletes in boxing, I am looking forward to making the transition into the concert business. I anticipate a warm, honest and open working relationship with the Jacksons, one we&#39;ll be proud of.&quot; Joe, the proud father end original manager of the Jackson 5, returned King&#39;s compliments by saying, &quot;We&#39;ve welcomed Don as the one who can and will make it happen for the Jacksons in 1984. This is indeed &quot;Family Affair&quot; for all of us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As I said before, Don King talked and talked and complimented and thanked until everyone in attendance, wondered if there was no end to this man&#39;s wind! (We all agreed by the end the press conference that there wasn&#39;t!!)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However there was a short (very short) spell when everyone including King was so silent until you could&#39;ve heard a pin drop and that was when the Jacksons were introduced and were asked their first question.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bedecked in fashionable garments and pitch black sunglasses, Michael, Marlon, Tito, Jermaine. Randy and Jackie filed onto the makeshift stage, took a quick bow and slid into their seats. The audience applauded wildly for a moment and fell silent. The floor was then opened for questions:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Why are all of you wearing those shades?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon: Because we knew you would ask that question.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Did your union or reunion grow out of the Motown Special?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine: That had a lot to do with it. The fact that we were back together after 8 years proved we wanted to show a lot of love around the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Q. How much is Pepsi investing in the tour as sponsors? Don: Multi-millions. Somewhere between 5 and 25 million.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: How many states will this tour cover?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don: Well, right now we want to talk about the United States and after we have taken care of old glory, we&#39;re not sure. But before we give out all of our secrets, we&#39;ll give another press conference after we finish the album. Then we&#39;ll be able to toll you dates, time, and places. Right now, what we&#39;re doing is announcing the joint venture between Katherine Jackson, Joe Jackson and myself and the Jacksons. And after this union and reunion. today America, tomorrow the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Where will you be performing? What kind of concert halls?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon: In large stadiums.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Would the Grand Canyon be a good spot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon: Yeah, if we could get seats in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Michael, could you please take off your glasses?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Michael shook his head no after conferring with the group.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Do you plan to go to South Africa?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don: Absolutely not!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Where did you get that hairstyle, Don?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don: My hair is like Samson&#39;s hair.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: We want to hear something from Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I can&#39;t really say much today, but I would like to introduce my family. (Michael introduces his mom and dad, Frankie Crocker, Latoya, Janet, his brothers&#39; &quot;beautiful wives&quot;, Hazel, Carol, Enid, and Dee Dee. And then he mentioned that his sister Maureen was unable to come, but she was in the studio recording an album on CBS.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don: There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the golden voice of song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: What&#39;s the name of the tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jermaine: &quot;Victory&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Michael, you don&#39;t need this tour professionally. What does it mean to you personally?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From that question on, Don King took control of the question and answer segment. First, he hedged Michael&#39;s questioning by saying: &quot;Michael&#39;s voice is a little strained from making all those hit records, and he won&#39;t be able to answer any more questions today.&quot; And then, after perhaps one or two more questions, Marlon managed to squeeze in that the &quot;Victory&quot; tour would be a way that the group could spread love and peace around the world. King ended the question and answer session.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I must admit this was certainly not what most of us had expected. We were sure we would have lots of time to question &quot;The Thriller&quot;, as well as the rest of his family about their individual feelings on the popularity of the tour, some of the things we can expect from it; will Michael do a solo segment, and so on. But as it stands, we&#39;ll all just have to wait until the next press conference to find out more on this mysterious and magical &quot;Victory Tour&quot; scheduled for this summer.</span></p></body>
