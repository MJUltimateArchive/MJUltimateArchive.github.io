Coleman, who had already orchestrated Jovan fragrances&#39; landmark sponsorship of the Rolling Stones&#39; Tattoo You tour, first proposed the idea to Coca-Cola.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They gave it serious consideration yet couldn&#39;t make that leap of faith,&quot; Coleman says. &quot;They saw anything they would do with Michael as a more targeted, ethnic campaign.&quot; Coca-Cola offered a $1 million deal that was rejected and the Jacksons moved on to PepsiCo, where then-CEO Roger Enrico was looking for a big idea to launch his youth-targeted &quot;New generation&quot; campaign for the brand. &quot;The goal was to make Pepsi look young and Coke look old, and Michael Jackson was in fact the choice of that generation -- he was already the King of Pop, even though he hadn&#39;t declared it,&quot; Coleman says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PepsiCo and its ad agency, BBDO, also hesitated at the possible cost, but Coleman&#39;s proposal proved too appealing. &quot;I pitched it as a multifaceted marketing campaign with lots of touch points: big-time advertising, tour sponsorship, logos on the cans, displays in the supermarket and PR-friendly events,&quot; Coleman says. When Jackson suggested using his song &quot;Billie Jean&quot; as the jingle (with the rewritten chorus, &quot;You&#39;re the Pepsi generation/Guzzle down and taste the thrill of the day/And feel the Pepsi way&quot;), Pepsi was sold.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But its impact on the music and advertising industries was equally widespread. &quot;It was definitely game-changing,&quot; says Brian J. Murphy, evp of branded entertainment at TBA Global. &quot;You couldn&#39;t separate the tour from the endorsement from the licensing of the music, and then the integration of the music into the Pepsi fabric. If you pulled any one of those pieces apart, it really took away from what the campaign was all about.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s creative input also was groundbreaking. &quot;Michael was very much involved in the execution of everything, from the choreography to the location scouting,&quot; says Bob Giraldi, who directed Jackson&#39;s most iconic Pepsi commercials -- from the very first &quot;street scene&quot; spot featuring kids dancing with their idol, to the &quot;Bad&quot; series that amounted to a mini action movie -- as well as the &quot;Beat It&quot; music video. &quot;He really knew what worked.&quot;</span></p></body>
