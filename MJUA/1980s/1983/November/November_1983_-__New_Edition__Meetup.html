I&#39;m not joking!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brown, flanked by NE members Ralph Tresvant and Johnny Gill, said the group didn&#39;t get to stick around much after dancing with Jackson, although they </span><span class="cs43C038A">did</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> get to see the video for &quot;Thriller&quot; before its official premiere, according to Tresvant. But what they really wanted from their encounter with Michael Jackson didn&#39;t quite pan out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The late icon invited the guys to stay the night at his house but, according to Brown, their manager turned the invite down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were always upset [about that], because we couldn&#39;t stay the night,&quot; Brown explained. &quot;We were upset because we wanted to stay and get to know him better. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time around some great artists, but he was definitely the greatest artist </span><span class="cs43C038A">and</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> person I&#39;ve ever been around.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brown, along with Gill and Tresvant, honored Jackson during the opening of the 2009 BET Awards by performing a medley of Jackson 5 hits. Brown led the way as their rendition of &quot;ABC&quot; and &quot;The Love You Save&quot; got a standing ovation from the star-studded crowd, which included Beyonc&eacute;, Kanye West and Jackson family members.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ronnie DeVoe, &ldquo;New Edition&rdquo; member, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/ALIZHFOGAZs?t=3m59s"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MaximoTV&rdquo; (July 1, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We remember, as a matter of fact, back in 1984, we got the opportunity to visit Mike, you know, at the house in Hayvenhurst, [in Encino, California] and he just ran us around the place, you know, showed us the llama, I think Bubbles was around as a matter of fact; they took us in this one room that really had a montage of pictures all over the wall, and then it had mirror on the other side where, you know, Michael rehearsed and things like that, we got a chance to do the cross-step with him, as matter of fact, in that room, so&hellip;I mean, [he was] a legendary individual, he talked about being immortal, and I think his music is gonna allow him to do that.</span></p></body>
