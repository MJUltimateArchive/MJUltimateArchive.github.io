I couldn&#39;t believe it - &ldquo;What the heck you wanna take a picture with us for?&quot; But the answer was simple. Michael admired anyone he thought was an exceptional talent. He felt a kinship to them, and that&#39;s what made him such a wonderful person. There was not a jealous bone in his body. So Berry came from his table, we came from ours and we all took the picture.</span></p></body>
