It was so perfect and so show business that I wore it on Motown 25.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the night before the taping, I still had no idea what I was going to do with my solo number. So I went down to the kitchen of our house and played &quot;Billie Jean.&quot; Loud. I was in there by myself, the night before the show, and I pretty much stood there and let the song tell me what to do. I kind of let the dance create itself. I really let it talk to me; I heard the beat come in, and I took this spy&#39;s hat and started to pose and step, letting the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; rhythm create the movements. I felt almost compelled to let it create itself. I couldn&#39;t help it. And that - being able to &quot;step back&quot; and let the dance come through - was a lot of fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had also been practising certain steps and movements, although most of the performance was actually spontaneous. I had been practising the Moonwalk for some time, and it dawned on me in our kitchen that I would finally do the Moonwalk in public on Motown 25.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now the Moonwalk was already out on the street by this time, but I enhanced it a little when I did it. It was born as a break-dance step, a &quot;popping&quot; type of thing that blacks kids had created dancing on the street corners in the ghetto. Black people are truly innovative dancers; they create many of the new dances, pure and simple. So I said, &quot;This is my chance to do it,&quot; and I did it. These three kids taught it to me. They gave me the basics and I had been doing it a lot in private. I had practised it together with certain other steps. All I was really sure of was that on the bridge to &quot;Billie Jean&quot; I was going to walk backward and forward at the same time, like walking on the moon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Steve Knopper, author, &ldquo;MJ: The Genius of Michael Jackson&rdquo; (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/inside-michael-jacksons-iconic-first-moonwalk-onstage-56650/"><span class="cs8567212B">October 5, 2015 excerpt link</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The night before the taping of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, MJ rehearsed at Hayvenhurst.
