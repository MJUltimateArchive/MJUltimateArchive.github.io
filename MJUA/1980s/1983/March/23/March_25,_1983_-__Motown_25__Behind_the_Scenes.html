Those were magic moments with all my brothers, including Jermaine. You know, those were good songs. I like those songs a lot. But especially, I like the new songs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Moonwalk&rdquo; autobiography (February 1, 1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On May 16, 1983, I performed &quot;Billie Jean&quot; on a network telecast in honor of Motown&#39;s twenty-fifth anniversary. Almost fifty million people saw that show. After that, many things changed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Motown 25 show had actually been taped a month earlier, in April [Correction: March 25]. The whole title was Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, and Forever , and I&#39;m forced to admit I had to be talked into doing it. I&#39;m glad I did because the show eventually produced some of the happiest and proudest moments of my life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As I mentioned earlier, I said no to the idea at first. I had been asked to appear as a member of the Jacksons and then do a dance number on my own. But none of us were Motown artists any longer. There were lengthy debates between me and my managers, Weisner and DeMann. I thought about how much Berry Gordy had done for me and the group, but I told my managers and Motown that I didn&#39;t want to go on TV. My whole attitude toward TV is fairly negative. Eventually Berry came to see me to discuss it. I was editing &quot;Beat It&quot; at the Motown studio, and someone must have told him I was in the building. He came down to the studio and talked to me about it at length. I said, &quot;Okay, but if I do it, I want to do &lsquo;Billie Jean.&#39;&quot; It would have been the only non-Motown song in the whole show. He told me that&#39;s what he wanted me to do anyway. So we agreed to do a Jacksons&#39; medley, which would include Jermaine. We were all thrilled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I gathered my brothers and rehearsed them for this show. I really worked them, and it felt nice, a bit like the old days of the Jackson 5. I choreographed them and rehearsed them for days at our house in Encino, videotaping every rehearsal so we could watch it later. Jermaine and Marlon also made their contributions. Next we went to Motown in Pasadena for rehearsals. We did our act and, even though we reserved our energy and never went all out at rehearsal, all the people there were clapping and coming around and watching us. Then I did my &quot;Billie Jean&quot; rehearsal. I just walked through it because as yet I had nothing planned. I hadn&#39;t had time because I was so busy rehearsing the group.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next day I called my management office and said, &quot;Please order me a spy&#39;s hat, like a cool fedora - something that a secret agent would wear.&quot; I wanted something sinister and special, a real slouchy kind of hat. I still didn&#39;t have a very good idea of what I was going to do with &quot;Billie Jean.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the Thriller sessions, I had found a black jacket, and I said, &quot;You know, someday I&#39;m going to wear this to perform. It was so perfect and so show business that I wore it on Motown 25.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the night before the taping, I still had no idea what I was going to do with my solo number. So I went down to the kitchen of our house and played &quot;Billie Jean.&quot; Loud. I was in there by myself, the night before the show, and I pretty much stood there and let the song tell me what to do. I kind of let the dance create itself. I really let it talk to me; I heard the beat come in, and I took this spy&#39;s hat and started to pose and step, letting the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; rhythm create the movements. I felt almost compelled to let it create itself. I couldn&#39;t help it. And that - being able to &quot;step back&quot; and let the dance come through - was a lot of fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had also been practising certain steps and movements, although most of the performance was actually spontaneous. I had been practising the Moonwalk for some time, and it dawned on me in our kitchen that I would finally do the Moonwalk in public on Motown 25.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now the Moonwalk was already out on the street by this time, but I enhanced it a little when I did it. It was born as a break-dance step, a &quot;popping&quot; type of thing that blacks kids had created dancing on the street corners in the ghetto. Black people are truly innovative dancers; they create many of the new dances, pure and simple. So I said, &quot;This is my chance to do it,&quot; and I did it. These three kids taught it to me. They gave me the basics and I had been doing it a lot in private. I had practised it together with certain other steps. All I was really sure of was that on the bridge to &quot;Billie Jean&quot; I was going to walk backward and forward at the same time, like walking on the moon. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the day of the taping, Motown was running behind schedule. Late. So I went off and rehearsed by myself. By then I had my spy hat. My brothers wanted to know what the hat was for, but I told them they&#39;d have to wait and see. But I did ask Nelson Hayes for a favour. &quot;Nelson - after I do the set with my brothers and the lights go down, sneak the hat out to me in the dark. I&#39;ll be in the corner, next to the wings, talking to the audience, but you sneak that hat back there and put it in my hand in the dark.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So after my brothers and I finished performing, I walked over to the side of the stage and said, &quot;You&#39;re beautiful! I&#39;d like to say those were the good old days; those were magic moments with all my brothers, including Jermaine. But what I really like&quot; - and Nelson is sneaking the hat into my hand - &quot;are the newer songs.&quot; I turned around and grabbed the hat and went into &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; into that heavy rhythm; I could tell that people in the audience were really enjoying my performance. My brothers told me they were crowding the wings watching me with their mouths open, and my parents and sisters were out there in the audience. But I just remember opening my eyes at the end of the thing and seeing this sea of people standing up, applauding. And I felt so many conflicting emotions. I knew I had done my best and felt good, so good. But at the same time I felt disappointed in myself. I had planned to do one really long spin and to stop on my toes, suspended for a moment, but I didn&#39;t stay on my toes as long as I wanted. I did the spin and I landed on one toe. I wanted to just stay there, just freeze there, but it didn&#39;t work quite as I&#39;d planned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I got backstage, the people back there were congratulating me. I was still disappointed about the spin. I had been concentrating so hard and I&#39;m such a perfectionist. At the same time I knew this was one of the happiest moments of my life. I knew that for the first time my brothers had really gotten a chance to watch me and see what I was doing, how I was evolving. After the performance, each of them hugged and kissed me backstage. They had never done that before, and I felt happy for all of us. It was so wonderful when they kissed me like that. I loved it! I mean, we hug all the time. My whole family embraces a lot, except for my father. He&#39;s the only one who doesn&#39;t. Whenever the rest of us see each other, we embrace, but when they all kissed me that night, I felt as if I had been blessed by them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The performance was still gnawing at me, and I wasn&#39;t satisfied until a little boy came up to me backstage. He was about ten years old and was wearing a tuxedo. He looked up at me with stars in his eyes, frozen where he stood, and said, &quot;Man, who ever taught you to dance like that?&quot; I kind of laughed and said, &quot;Practice, I guess.&quot; And this boy was looking at me, awestruck. I walked away, and for the first time that evening I felt really good about what I had accomplished that night. I said to myself, I must have done really well because children are honest. When that kid said what he did, I really felt that I had done a good job. I was so moved by the whole experience that I went right home and wrote down everything which had happened that night. My entry ended with my encounter with the child.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Gold&rdquo; magazine interview (November 2002)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember the first time I did the moonwalk. Fred called me at home. He was screaming on the phone, raving. He said it was the best performance he&#39;d ever seen. I said, &#39;Oh, come on.&#39; He said, &#39;Michael, you put them on their ass.You&#39;re a hell of a mover. You&#39;re a hell of a dancer.&#39; I said, &#39;Well, coming from you, I don&#39;t need any awards.&#39; Because I was nominated for an Emmy for that performance, and I didn&#39;t get it, but it didn&#39;t matter to me because Fred Astaire said he loved my performance, and that&#39;s all the award I needed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Ebony&rdquo; magazine interview (September 25, 2007)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Another big moment was the Motown 25 performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was at the studio editing &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; and for some reason I happened to be at Motown Studios doing it &ndash; I had long left the company. So they were getting ready to do something with the Motown anniversary, and Berry Gordy came by and asked me did I want to do the show I told him NO. I said no because the Thriller thing, I was building and creating something I was planning to do, and he said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the anniversary.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will do it, but the only way I&rsquo;ll do it is if you let me do one song that&rsquo;s not a Motown song.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Billie Jean.&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;OK, fine.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll really let me do &lsquo;Billie Jean?&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I rehearsed and choreographed and dressed my brothers, and picked the songs and the medley. And not only that, you have to work out all the camera angles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I direct and edit everything I do. Every shot you see is my shot. Let me tell you why I have to do it that way. I have five, no, six cameras. When you&rsquo;re performing &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t care what kind of performance you are giving &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t capture it properly, the people will never see it. It&rsquo;s the most selfish medium in the world. You&rsquo;re filming WHAT you want people to see, WHEN you want them to see it, HOW you want them to see it and what JUXTAPOSITION you want them to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...One of the things that touched me the most about doing [&ldquo;Motown 25&rdquo;] was, after I did the performance&mdash;I&#39;ll never forget. There was Marvin Gaye in the wings, and the Temptations and Smokey Robinson and my brothers, they were hugging me and kissing me and holding me. Richard Pryor walked over to me and said [in a quiet voice], &quot;Now that was the greatest performance I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; That was my reward. These were people who, when I was a little boy in Indiana, I used to listen to. Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, and to have them bestow that kind of appreciation on me, I was just honored. Then the next day, Fred Astaire called and said, &quot;I watched it last night, and I taped it, and I watched it again this morning. You&#39;re a helluva mover. You put the audience on their ASS last night!&quot; So later, when I saw Fred Astaire, he did this with his fingers [he makes a little Moonwalk gesture with his two fingers on his outstretched palm].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember doing the performance so clearly, and I remember that I was so upset with myself, &#39;cause it wasn&#39;t what I wanted. I wanted it to be more. But not until I finished. [There] was a little child, a little Jewish child backstage with a little tuxedo on. He looked at me and he said [in a stunned voice] &quot;Who taught you to move like that?&quot; [Laughter] And I said, &quot;I guess God &ndash; and rehearsal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jermaine Jackson, from his autobiography &ldquo;You Are Not Alone&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It had been almost eighteen years since we had first set out as artists in Gary, and twenty-five since Mr. Gordy had launched his label in Detroit. To mark that quarter-century milestone, NBC was taping the telecast Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Suzanne de Passe was one of its producers and she called to say that they wanted the Jackson 5 to perform at the reunion concert as part of the salute to Mr. Gordy. It sounded amazing on paper. Just the thought of performing again with the brothers elated me. For six years, I&rsquo;d had a recurring dream that I was onstage with them and I was counting a song off in my head, just about to sing . . . and then I&rsquo;d wake. My unconscious had teased me with that promise for too long. Now, it was going to be a reality and I couldn&rsquo;t wait.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was certain Michael would feel the same, especially since his attic picture gallery celebrated this very era, and considering his love for Mr. Gordy. But the reality of the music industry is that advisers have an artist&rsquo;s ear and his camp&rsquo;s brand focus was &ldquo;Michael Jackson&rdquo; not the Jackson 5. It was about the future, not the past. And with everyone caught up in the momentum of Thriller, I guess no one wanted to concern him with a night in Memory Lane. As they saw it, Motown 25 would benefit Mr. Gordy and the brothers, but what good could it do Michael? My brother also had his own reservations. But although it was reported that he didn&rsquo;t want to perform with his brothers again, it was never about that. His early opposition was about not wanting to perform on TV. Still bruised from his CBS exposure on The Jacksons, he was surer than ever that television was a damaging medium to true stardom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The rest of us felt he was making a mistake. Mother was the first to ask him to rethink his position. &ldquo;Motown did give you and the brothers your start,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d be performing on the same stage as all the acts you idolized as a boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said he&rsquo;d think about it, but that hesitancy didn&rsquo;t sit well with me. I called him at home. When I heard his voice, I immediately sensed he was exhausted with the subject but I felt strongly that he was approaching this from a negative viewpoint or listening to bad advice, and brothers have the right to challenge another brother&rsquo;s thinking. &ldquo;You know, being back together will be spectacular,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;All our fans will be there and that magic will make good TV, not bad TV.&rdquo; I reminded him of when he&rsquo;d done &ldquo;The Robot&rdquo; dance on Soul Train and the power of that performance. How it had got half of L.A.&rsquo;s kids up and dancing; how empowered he was by it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That was different,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was then. I don&rsquo;t want to do no more TV. I want to be doing music videos and live performances. I don&rsquo;t want to do what the Osmonds are doing.&rdquo; He was calm but resolute. I could do nothing but respect his artistic reasons, and I was resigned to the fact we&rsquo;d be doing Motown 25 without him. Privately, I was crushed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next thing I knew, Mother was on the phone saying Mr. Gordy had turned up. I wouldn&rsquo;t have put any money on a positive outcome, because if Mother couldn&rsquo;t persuade Michael, then no one could. But my father-in-law had always said that the defection to CBS Records &ldquo;was not only amicable but wrapped in love,&rdquo; as far as the brothers were concerned and he visited Michael to convey how important it was for him to be there on the night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Think about it,&rdquo; he told Michael, &ldquo;up there again with Jermaine . . . together again . . . back onstage. It will be magic!&rdquo; Mr. Gordy had never forgotten that phone call Michael had made before the Westbury Music Fair, saying he needed me. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not just Jermaine who needs you now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me and the Motown family.&rdquo; He reminded him that Smokey would be back with the Miracles, and Diana Ross would reunite with the Supremes. No one could imagine the night without Michael reuniting with the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael saw wisdom. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said. But on one condition: he&rsquo;d do a Jackson 5 medley but then he wanted a solo spot to showcase &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo;&mdash;a CBS Records song on a night dedicated to Motown. You have to admire that kind of nerve and maybe that was why Mr. Gordy agreed to the compromise. Either way, everyone was in agreement and we all wanted to make this thing feel special.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We got busy and rehearsed our group choreography at both Hayvenhurst and Jackie&rsquo;s house but none of us knew what Michael had up his sleeve for his solo spot. At some point, he had decided he&rsquo;d use the television platform to try out a move he&rsquo;d borrowed from street-dancers, one he had been finessing for the past two years. It was a move called &ldquo;The Moonwalk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The one thing Michael fussed over for this grand performance was his wardrobe. He had the white sequined glove, the Sammy Davis&ndash;style half-mast black pants, white socks, the silver sparkly shirt, and he asked his management to order a black fedora, &ldquo;something that a secret agent would wear.&rdquo; But the jacket? However hard he looked, he couldn&rsquo;t find it. He opened the doors of his quarters, looked down the hallway and saw that Mother&rsquo;s bedroom door was open. As a lover of anything shiny, he had once seen her wear a black sequined jacket and he went to her closet to fish it out. He put it on and walked downstairs to find its owner in the kitchen. &ldquo;This would be a good jacket for me to do a show in!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it fits good!&rdquo; He loved it because when he moved it sparkled. &ldquo;Imagine it under the lights,&rdquo; he said. That was how Mother&rsquo;s jacket found its place in history. With a dance borrowed from the streets of L.A. and a jacket from Mother&rsquo;s closet, Michael was show-ready.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One question fans always ask me about the Moonwalk moment is: &ldquo;What was Michael like before and after the performance?&rdquo; In people&rsquo;s minds, this defining moment of his career has adopted a significance they assume was present in its build-up: that Michael was locked in some kind of trancelike focus, ready to unleash his wonder on the world. The truth was a little less remarkable. He treated the telecast at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium like a piece of cake. It was a big deal for Mr. Gordy and Motown, but it was just another performance for Michael. When we asked him what he was planning for his spot, he simply said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something that might work.&rdquo; And then we didn&rsquo;t see him. He just . . . disappeared. He must have been gone half an hour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Where you been?&rdquo; I asked, when he came back to the dressing room. He started chuckling and that mischievous grin spread across his face. &ldquo;Been up in Diana&rsquo;s rooms . . . She&rsquo;s got some serious suitcases going on!&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wait. I&rsquo;ve just seen Diana Ross&mdash;and you weren&rsquo;t with her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He looked at me. I looked at him, and we died laughing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been rooting through Diana&rsquo;s stuff!&rdquo; So that was one part of the question answered. What was Michael like before the show? He was nosing about his mentor&rsquo;s dressing room, wondering what she had in there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was also all over the production team during rehearsals, wanting to know every detail of the telecast. Every performer has to run through &ldquo;camera blocking&rdquo; to allow the director to frame his shots, but Michael wanted to know what those shots were, how many cameras he had and at what angles. All this before the editing process! It was part of his methodical approach&mdash;and control.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He explained it best in an interview with Ebony magazine in 2007 and what he said applied to every live performance and music video he ever did. He said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what kind of performance you are giving&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t capture it properly, the people will never see it. You&rsquo;re filming WHAT you want people to see, WHEN you want them to see it, HOW you want them to see it, what JUXTAPOSITION you want them to see. You&rsquo;re creating the totality of the whole feeling of what&rsquo;s being presented . . . &rsquo;cause I know what I want to see. I know what I want to go to the audience. I know what I want to come back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For me, the perfect moment came when we walked onstage as the original Jackson 5, and the magic and chemistry returned naturally. All that had altered was that we weren&rsquo;t kids any more and, golly, we had fun that night. I was overcome with this sensation of &ldquo;WE&rsquo;RE BACK!&rdquo; even if it was for only one night. I didn&rsquo;t care, because this was the moment that, in the back of my mind, I&rsquo;d known would happen again. I embraced it with a kind of homecoming jubilation. Poetically, when it was my part to sing on &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There,&rdquo; during the medley, my mic went out. Michael, alert to every beat, sensed it, saw my lips move with no sound and scooted over to share his mic, putting his arm around me as I sang. There is a wonderful picture of this moment, with both of us smiling. I think many people thought it was staged as we both leaned into his mic, but it was a technical glitch we got away with and that image is one I treasure from a momentous night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the end of our medley, Randy walked on and had his moment to recognize his input with the Jacksons, and then we bowed and everyone in the auditorium stood. That ovation meant everything, and we hugged each other before walking off, leaving Michael alone in the spotlight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now it was his turn, on his own. &ldquo;I have to say,&rdquo; he told the audience, &ldquo;those were the good old days. I love those songs. Those were magic moments with all my brothers, including Jermaine, but . . . er . . . those were good songs . . . I like those songs a lot, but especially . . . I like . . .&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The crowd started to scream and someone shouted, &ldquo;&ldquo;BILLIE JEAN!&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;. . . the new songs!&rdquo; Cue his virtuoso routine, which sent the place crazy with those kicks, toe-stands and spins of his. It was all improvisation, going with the beat. And then, at the bridge of the song, came the rehearsed moment: his first five-second burst of the Moonwalk, followed by another five seconds at the end. Ten seconds that would be talked about forever&mdash;and 10 seconds I missed when live.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was in the wings with a restricted view, standing with the Four Tops and the Temptations, when I heard the audience go nuts and I said, &ldquo;He got &rsquo;em . . . Mike&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; The other brothers watched it on small monitors and I knew from their reaction that the seventh child had just pulled off something special.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael came offstage to a standing ovation but was probably the only doubtful-looking person in the house. &ldquo;How was it? Did it work?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marvin Gaye, the Temptations and Smokey Robinson told him they were blown away, and then comedian Richard Pryor sidled up. &ldquo;What was that? That was incredible&mdash;the greatest performance I&rsquo;ve ever seen!&rdquo; We lost Michael in a crowd of praise and superlatives as everyone gathered around him. Mother and Joseph were in the audience somewhere, with our father screaming, &ldquo;He stole the show! The boy stole the show!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; performance was the best performance Michael had ever been talked into. It was also the best I ever saw him do. It poured rocket fuel on the Thriller album and sales went even crazier, peaking at a million a week. More importantly, within all the phenomenal success and wealth it generated, Michael finally sealed his name in The Guinness Book of World Records. Thriller became the biggest-selling record of all time, ultimately shifting more than 100 million copies worldwide, and it earned him his desired clutch of Grammys&mdash;winning a record number of eight. The kid who used to sing for a plate of cookies had now surpassed even our father&rsquo;s greatest expectations by setting two records, neither of which has been matched or surpassed since.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unknown to Michael, one of his idols was among the millions of viewers watching his Moonwalk from an armchair at home. My brother had no idea how his performance had touched this particular person until the phone rang the next day at Hayvenhurst. And even then, he struggled to believe it when he found Fred Astaire on the other end of the line. &ldquo;I watched it and I taped it, and I watched it again this morning,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a helluva mover. Man, you really put them on their asses last night!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That one call meant more to Michael than any number of Grammys. Fred Astaire admiring him was the ultimate as far as he was concerned, and life had finally fulfilled Joseph&rsquo;s CBS signing-on promise in an unexpected way. It might not have been a dinner, it was more important than that: it was praise from his hero, and that carried more meaning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&rsquo;s extra-nice about this story is that Michael got to meet this legend some weeks later and Fred Astaire held out the palm of one hand and imitated the Moonwalk with two fingers before Michael gave him a demonstration. Fred apparently told my brother that he was &ldquo;the best dancer he had ever seen,&rdquo; but it was the warning he issued that sticks in my mind: he told Michael that his &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; performance would bring social pressure for him to dance at the drop of a hat. &ldquo;Remember, you&rsquo;re not a performing monkey&mdash;you&rsquo;re an artist. You dance for no one but yourself,&rdquo; he apparently said. Michael, as ever, made a mental note.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As for Mother&rsquo;s jacket, she never did get it back. Michael needed it for his now-famous routine. Some years later, he presented it to Sammy Davis Junior. In return, Sammy gave him a treasured wristwatch, which Michael gave as a keepsake to Mother. Seemed like a fair swap to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Suzanne de Passe, &ldquo;Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues&rdquo; documentary (March 12, 1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael did not want to do Motown 25. &nbsp;Not because he didn&rsquo;t want to do anything for Motown but I think as much as he didn&rsquo;t want to do television. &nbsp;Once he decided he was going to do it, the man was obsessed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...You had to be at the old Pasadena Civic Auditorium that night because I don&rsquo;t think before or since will there ever be anything that would rival the discovery, the artistry, the expression. &nbsp;The entire audience was caught in a spell. &nbsp;Michael was hot record wise but we had only seen him in videos and here he was all by himself on stage doing something that no one had seen him do before.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Steve Knopper, author, &ldquo;MJ: The Genius of Michael Jackson&rdquo; (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/inside-michael-jacksons-iconic-first-moonwalk-onstage-56650/"><span class="cs8567212B">October 5, 2015 excerpt link</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1983, Suzanne de Passe, still Berry Gordy&rsquo;s loyal number two, had an idea to revitalize the famous but fading Motown Records. She pitched Gordy a twenty-fifth-anniversary reunion show. Profits would go to charity. Gordy liked the idea and thought he could talk most of his former stars into it. He was wrong, at least at first. Diana Ross was living a new kind of life &mdash; without Gordy. She spent her days hobnobbing with fashion designers like Halston and Calvin Klein, dining at the Four Seasons, hanging out at Studio 54, and vacationing at her new manor in Fairfield, Connecticut. Her first RCA album, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Why Do Fools Fall in Love</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, hit the top ten, and the follow-up, Silk Electric, had gone gold, thanks in part to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s heavy-breathing, finger-snapping contribution on the song &ldquo;Muscles&rdquo; (which Michael produced, wrote, and named after his boa constrictor). When de Passe called about Motown 25, Ross declined. But de Passe knew Ross. She went to the press, predicting Ross would show up as a &ldquo;special guest star.&rdquo; Ross fans became excited, and the singer realized she couldn&rsquo;t back out without looking bad. So she accepted the invitation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stevie Wonder said okay, if he could make it back in time from a tour of Africa. Marvin Gaye was in, if Gordy asked him personally. Ross&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Lady Sings the Blues</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> costar Richard Pryor, still the world&rsquo;s hottest comedian despite his growing drug problems, agreed to emcee. And Michael Jackson &hellip; he agreed, too, but how he came to do so depends on who tells the story. According to Berry, Jackson felt overexposed on television and was inclined to sit in the audience and silently show his support. So a cowed Gordy begged him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Motown&rsquo;s Suzee Ikeda, who worked as a liaison between the Jackson 5 and their record label in the old days, tells it differently. It was ten days before the taping when Jermaine Jackson, still a Motown recording artist, began to call her repeatedly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s asked my brothers to do the show!&rdquo; Jermaine complained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding,&rdquo; Ikeda said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Suzanne hasn&rsquo;t asked them,&rdquo; he responded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ikeda called Gordy and asked permission to go over de Passe&rsquo;s head, to call Michael directly for a commitment. He agreed. When Ikeda and Jackson talked, old Motown friends catching up, she was careful to bring up other subjects before </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Finally, she said: &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s coming back to do this show. You&rsquo;ve got to do this show,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If the Jackson 5, one of the biggest acts in the company, don&rsquo;t come back to do it, it&rsquo;s not going to be the same.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Michael said.*</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In both Jermaine&rsquo;s recollection and in MJ&rsquo;s autobiography </span><span class="cs43C038A">Moonwalk</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Michael asked for a solo performance on the spot. Ikeda says it was Gordy who suggested Michael do the song, only privately to Ikeda, without even discussing it with Michael. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Ikeda told Gordy. Later, serendipitously, Michael called Ikeda and said, &ldquo;Berry&rsquo;s going to get mad, but I want to do something &mdash; &lsquo;Billie Jean.&#39;&rdquo; Delighted, Ikeda strongly advised Michael not to let the regular live Motown 25 band perform the music &mdash; &ldquo;because they&rsquo;ll never get the groove.&rdquo; Michael and Ikeda thus agreed he would lip-synch his performance to the original track. Ikeda communicated the news to Gordy, who was thrilled. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The dancing itself required no negotiation. Michael would handle everything about that himself. &ldquo;Nobody else worked with him on it,&rdquo; Ikeda says. &ldquo;He told the director, he told everybody, how he wanted that stage, what type of lighting he wanted. He told them where to put the spotlight. &lsquo;When I put my finger like this &hellip;&rsquo; He directed them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael often claimed he invented the routine to &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; spontaneously, because he had spent so much time rehearsing with his brothers for the show&rsquo;s Motown medley that he neglected everything else. What he did not say was how long he had been thinking about this performance. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The dance Michael chose, the backslide, was hardly new. Bill Bailey, an African-American tap-dancing star, pulled it off as early as the 1950s. Rocker David Bowie does a bit of the move in an early video for &ldquo;Aladdin Sane.&rdquo; Mimes used it all the time &mdash; Marcel Marceau&rsquo;s famous routine &ldquo;Walking in the Wind&rdquo; was essentially the backslide by another name, and Robert Shields of Shields and Yarnell learned it from Marceau** himself. James Brown and Bill &ldquo;Mr. Bojangles&rdquo; Robinson, both influences on Michael, were among the greats who&rsquo;d pulled it off. Many dancers would take credit for bestowing the backslide upon Michael Jackson &mdash; Damita Jo Freeman of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Soul Train</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> makes a credible claim, recalling that her lesson came backstage in Vegas in the late seventies. But it was two young dancers, Casper Candidate and Cooley Jaxson, who taught it to him directly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1979, Casper and Cooley had appeared on </span><span class="cs43C038A">Soul Train</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. They performed a dance called the Boogaloo, named after a street-dancing group, the Electric Boogaloos. For four minutes, dressed in black, they ignored the laws of gravity and physics, pulling off hip thrusts and acrobatic leaps set to MJ&rsquo;s &ldquo;Workin&rsquo; Day and Night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Casper and Cooley aren&rsquo;t sure how their dance clip came to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s attention, but they suspect he watched the show as it aired &mdash; it was his song, after all. Some of those moves, particularly the pelvic thrusts and sideways motions that make dancers&rsquo; legs look like rubber bands, had already landed in the &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; video. As he was preparing for his </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> performance, Michael asked one of his managers to track down the duo. Jaxson, auditioning for </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sesame Street Live</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> in San Francisco, flew to Los Angeles, where he met Candidate at a large rehearsal space. A boom box sat on the floor. Michael introduced himself. They talked for five hours. All he wanted to talk about was the backslide. &ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo; he kept asking. &ldquo;Where did it start?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They taught him the move. Unsurprisingly, MJ picked it up quickly. But he didn&rsquo;t think he did. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t feel it!&rdquo; he kept saying.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I understood that at the time,&rdquo; Cooley recalls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more of a mime type of feel. Like you&rsquo;re making a box, but you&rsquo;re not making a box. If you&rsquo;re doing it, it looks like you&rsquo;re gliding.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cooley has spent much of his career giving credit to others for the backslide &mdash; Bill Bailey, James Brown, Shields and Yarnell. What frustrates him, years later, is that Jackson wasn&rsquo;t similarly aggressive about giving credit to his forebears. In </span><span class="cs43C038A">Moonwalk</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Michael refers to the move as &ldquo;a break-dance step, a &lsquo;popping&rsquo; type of thing that black kids had created dancing on street corners in the ghetto.&rdquo; &ldquo;We kind of ended up being invisible,&rdquo; says Cooley, now in his early fifties. &ldquo;But we never said anything about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The night before the taping of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, MJ rehearsed at Hayvenhurst. Katherine and La Toya were accustomed to Michael practicing every Saturday and Sunday in a room above the garage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he was doing the moonwalk up there, but we never knew it,&rdquo; Katherine said. In the kitchen, he played &ldquo;Billie Jean.&rdquo; &ldquo;I pretty much stood there and let the song tell me what to do,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;I kind of let the dance create itself. I really let it talk to me; I heard the beat come in, and I took this spy&rsquo;s hat and started to pose and step, letting the &lsquo;Billie Jean&rsquo; rhythm create the movements. I felt almost compelled to let it create itself. I couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; Michael obviously had been thinking about [among other things] 1974&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Little Prince</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, in which a grown man befriends a magical young boy in a double-breasted peacoat. The great choreographer Bob Fosse shows up as a snake, modeling a half-dozen poses, gestures, and struts MJ would [implement in his own style of dancing].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Having secured the talent, de Passe and Gordy were able to make a </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> deal with NBC. They booked the Pasadena Civic Auditorium on March 25, 1983. During rehearsals, thirty-eight-year-old Diana Ross showed up in a long, white mink coat, Courvoisier in hand, worrying Gordy and de Passe by declaring she had the stomach flu. But the night of the show, she emerged from her limo glamorous as ever, mugging for photographers. Because the producers wanted young, new talent in the show, they hired British MTV star Adam Ant to perform &ldquo;Where Did Our Love Go?&rdquo; in awkward new-wave makeup and what appeared to be a Revolutionary War costume. &ldquo;Now what Adams Ant had to do with Motown, you tell me. I have no idea,&rdquo; says veteran Motown singer and songwriter Valerie Simpson, upset to this day that a songwriter segment she&rsquo;d hosted was cut from the program. Ant, though, was intertwined with Motown history. Gordy had once tried to sign him, which led to his spending the day with Michael Jackson and his family at their house on Hayvenhurst. Later, Michael called about the distinctive brocade jacket Ant had worn in the &ldquo;Kings of the Wild Frontier&rdquo; video. Ant put MJ in touch with his supplier, and the next thing he knew, Michael was wearing military jackets everywhere. Watching Michael on </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Ant&rsquo;s concern was simply, &ldquo;How the fuck do you follow that?&rdquo; Says Ant: &ldquo;It was like the Beatles on </span><span class="cs43C038A">Ed Sullivan</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, that&rsquo;s what it was.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson and his brothers had taken the stage for the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> taping in a conquering mood. Jackie wore a bright-green glittery open-collar shirt and black leather pants. Marlon was in a </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sgt. Pepper</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&ndash;style topcoat; as a dancer, he had always fed off Michael, but this time he and Jackie came out as dueling dervishes. Jermaine returned to the band and provided an emotional boost. Michael, in particular, seemed moved to have him back. (None of the Jacksons had live microphones except Michael, so when Jermaine sang his bit in &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There,&rdquo; Michael walked over to share his mike with his brother, and they embraced; it was a beautiful moment of both reclaimed family unity and practiced showbiz.) It was the first time since Vegas that all the Jackson brothers were onstage together, a fact not lost on Michael, who couldn&rsquo;t contain himself when his younger brother, the newest member of the family group, came bounding onstage. &ldquo;Randy!&rdquo; he shouted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael ran through &ldquo;I Want You Back,&rdquo; &ldquo;Never Can Say Goodbye,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There&rdquo; exactly as he&rsquo;d done for fourteen straight years. The Jackson 5 had always exuded an element of contained chaos &mdash; Michael had to keep his talent from spilling onto the stage in order to preserve his role within the group. He strutted and stepped in unison with his brothers, sporadically popping in front of them, spinning and crooning. The audience, both that night at the auditorium and a month later, when the show aired on NBC, had every reason to believe this performance would be the show&rsquo;s emotional peak.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Neither the viewers nor the Jackson brothers knew his costume throughout the reunion medley &mdash; black jacket covered in sequins (borrowed from his mother), silver lam&eacute; shirt, black trousers with high cuffs, white socks, Fred Astaire&ndash;style loafers, a white glove on his left hand containing 1,200 rhinestones sewn by hand, and a curly-mullet hairstyle matching the cover of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &mdash; was designed not for sentimentality but action. After finishing their Motown medley, the brothers bounded offstage, proud, hugging each other, sipping generously, as always, from the crowd&rsquo;s adoration. Then Michael delivered a speech by </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> scriptwriter Buz Kohan. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Michael said, as the applause died down. &ldquo;Aw. You&rsquo;re beautiful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The moment begins to resemble the color seeping into </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wizard of Oz</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &mdash; out of the past, into the present. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Michael says again. &ldquo;I have to say, those were the good old days.&rdquo; He speaks in short, declaratory sentences, breathing hard. &ldquo;I love those songs,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Those were magic moments. All my brothers. Including Jermaine. Those were good songs. I like those songs a lot.&rdquo; Then his tone changes, and Michael looks directly into the camera &mdash; he&rsquo;s Elvis Presley, aware of his power. &ldquo;But especially, I like &hellip;&rdquo; Somebody in the audience, a kid or a woman, audibly spoils the suspense: &ldquo;Billie Jean!&rdquo; Michael doesn&rsquo;t care. He raises his right eyebrow. He&rsquo;s staring straight ahead but not at anything, looking beyond the crowd &mdash; &ldquo;&hellip; the new songs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Music history remembers this speech the way it remembers the throwaway lines Presley, in the studio with his band, delivered in 1954. After halting the bluegrass ballad &ldquo;Milkcow Blues Boogie,&rdquo; Elvis declared, &ldquo;Hold it, fellas. That don&rsquo;t move me. Let&rsquo;s get real, real gone for a change.&rdquo; The resulting fast-paced version of &ldquo;Milkcow&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t technically the birth of rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll, but listening today, it feels like it. The moment echoed Benny Goodman, onstage in 1935 at Hollywood&rsquo;s Palomar ballroom, initially leading his orchestra in super-slow dinner-party music. When nobody paid attention, he reversed course with Fletcher Henderson&rsquo;s jumping arrangement for &ldquo;King Porter Stomp.&rdquo; A dance-floor riot ensued and the big-band swing era was born.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael reaches down for his black fedora, which resembles the bowler Bob Fosse wore in </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Little Prince</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. His longtime assistant, Nelson P. Hayes, had placed it there while the camera had been focused elsewhere. &ldquo;He must have made me rehearse that spot twenty times just to make sure that hat was going to be there, where it was supposed to be,&rdquo; Hayes recalls. It&rsquo;s dawning on the old Motown pros gathered at the auditorium just how meticulously Michael had choreographed this moment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Drums: Bum-bap, bum-bap, bum-bap. Michael twirls to the left. He&rsquo;s posing, hat upside-down in his right hand. He plops the hat on his head. Bass. Michael thrusts his crotch forward, again and again, then kicks his right leg so it&rsquo;s almost horizontal. For the next six seconds, his movements are so quick and fluid and connected that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to deconstruct and identify them. Michael splays his legs. He does more kicks. He holds a pose, then another in the reverse direction. He waves his hat to the right, but it&rsquo;s a basketball head fake, and instead he tosses it offstage to the left. He claps. He tap-dances, glides a little. Synths. Two more thrusts of the crotch, then a hair-combing motion &mdash; the suggestion of a rockabilly greaser. At this time, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly are old men, and &ldquo;The Band Wagon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Singin&rsquo; in the Rain&rdquo; seem hopelessly out of fashion in the rock era. Michael is bringing them back &mdash; the elegance, the dance tricks that seem like magic. Michael concentrates their moves into tantalizing bursts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Michael mouths the first line of &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;She was more like a beauty queen&rdquo; &mdash; his feet are unable to stop, bouncing left and right. Finally he settles down, eyes closed, concentrating into the microphone, tapping his left foot to the beat. He punctuates certain lines &mdash; &ldquo;she caused a SCENE&rdquo; &mdash; with high kicks, nearly parallel to the floor. Every moment is more intriguing than the next &mdash; he plants his foot to spin in a tight circle like he did with the Jackson 5, then holds his fists to his face, as if pleading, like James Brown, before hiking up his pants to display his white socks. For a moment, the camera catches a glimpse of the audience, unusually racially diverse for a concert hall in 1983, blacks and whites clapping together in tuxedos and gowns. The &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; guitar solo arrives and recedes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finally, as Michael executes the moonwalk, formerly known as the backslide, formerly a dance belonging to the Electric Boogaloos, Cab Calloway, James Brown, Damita Jo Freeman, Casper and Cooley, Jeffrey Daniel, Mr. Bojangles, Bob Fosse, Marcel Marceau, and Shields and Yarnell, a sort of screech erupts from the crowd. &ldquo;During rehearsals, he never did that. Only when he did the show,&rdquo; recalls Russ Terrana, who as Motown&rsquo;s veteran chief recording engineer was outside in the sound truck, taping </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> for posterity. &ldquo;My crew just went, &lsquo;What the hell was that?&rsquo; You could hear the audience going, &lsquo;Awwww-awwwww!&#39;&rdquo; Another leg kick, another whoop, another pose on the toes, two more spins, another brief glimpse of the moonwalk, and Michael is done. Is something different about his nose? It looks sculpted, precise, fussy, with thin little nostrils, not big and bold like it used to be. If anybody lingers over this detail, it is lost, for now, in the bigger story about the moonwalk. He bows and he is off. His brothers, mouths open in the wings throughout the performance, recover enough to slap Michael on the back when he returns. Before long, all the Motown stars are huddled around him. &ldquo;When everybody ran up to congratulate him, it was like he wasn&rsquo;t there. He had an out-of-body experience or something,&rdquo; Valerie Simpson recalls. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t respond to anybody. He wasn&rsquo;t back to himself yet. He couldn&rsquo;t come down to where he had gone to deal with us. It was just very, very eerie.&rdquo; Afterward, MJ would say he was preoccupied &mdash; he had meant to stay on his toes a few ticks longer during the performance, and he felt like he&rsquo;d failed. Nobody else noticed. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The day after the show aired, on May 16, 1983, Michael Jackson received a call from Fred Astaire. (&ldquo;Oh, come on,&rdquo; was Michael&rsquo;s first reaction.) Astaire was eighty-four. He had filmed his final movie, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Ghost Story</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, two years earlier. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hell of a mover. Man, you really put them on their asses last night,&rdquo; Fred Astaire told Michael Jackson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an angry dancer. I&rsquo;m the same way. I used to do the same thing with my cane.&rdquo; It remains a mystery exactly where the anger appears in Astaire&rsquo;s elegant ballroom dancing &mdash; his persona in movies is bemused and easygoing &mdash; but &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; was, in fact, an angry song, reflecting Michael&rsquo;s feelings of fear and distrust for those around him. Michael was also angry at his father, who was still tomcatting around on Katherine and milking the family for cash.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was the greatest compliment I had ever received in my life,&rdquo; Jackson would say of Astaire&rsquo;s call, &ldquo;and the only one I had ever wanted to believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After Michael spoke with Fred on the phone, he went into the bathroom and threw up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">*In still another version of the story, Jermaine writes in his autobiography that his mother talked Michael into it, as she&rsquo;d often done on behalf of Michael&rsquo;s brothers. The account ends the same way, with Michael saying, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; But Ikeda doesn&rsquo;t buy it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">**When Marceau died in 2007, MJ told </span><span class="cs43C038A">Jet</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> the moonwalk inspiration came not from the mime but from &ldquo;watching the great, rhythmic, wonderful black children dance around the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103735/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/blackbeatmay87.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Black Beat&rdquo; magazine (May 1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cut back to 1983, the evening of the &quot;Motown 25th&quot;, the historic musical extravaganza. Michael Jackson has just finished performing his &quot;Billie Jean&quot; segment, the renown performance that helped set his soaring comet in motion. As Jackson and company exit the auditorium, headed for the star-studded after party (which, incidentally, took over an entire Pasdena, California shopping mall), he comes upon Edmund Sylvers, who used to handle lead vocals for family group the Sylvers, potentially, one of the teenaged &nbsp;Jackson 5&#39;s most formidable rivals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson and Sylvers embrace, and then, according to an eyewitness: &quot;Michael says to Edmund, &#39;How&#39;s your family? You know, when we were younger, I was so intimated by you guys. I used to listen to the harmonies... you were so *good*.&#39;&quot; The two then pose for someone familiar to them as a photographer, only to discover that, this night, he has no camera. &quot;I don&#39;t believe *you* don&#39;t have a camera&quot;, Michael quips playfully. Jackson moves on and Sylvers, left with only a memory of the moment, is visibly moved by the compliment. &quot;Man&quot;, he sighs with a kind of melancholy joy, &quot;that&#39;s the greatest thing anyone could have told me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bill Whitten, Michael&rsquo;s lead designer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-02-21-vw-1158-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (February 21, 1990)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190905172459/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-02-21-vw-1158-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The single glove and ankle-high black pants, and white socks with loafers were all designed for one purpose.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was very simple,&rdquo; Whitten calmly explained. &ldquo;The audience was missing his hand and feet movements.

After the &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; performance, Jackson asked Whitten&mdash;who also dressed Elton John, Neil Diamond and Stevie Wonder&mdash;to design more gloves like the golf glove. Whitten designed the unique military jackets Jackson wore while promoting Thriller and the embellished socks and gloves. Each glove was covered in 1,200 hand-sewn Austrian crystals that took specialty artistic beaders at Artistic Hand Beading (which also worked with designers John Galanos, Bob Mackie and Jean Louis) in Los Angeles about 10 days to create. &ldquo;Bill and Michael were the creators of that look,&rdquo; Holman, who also worked at the shop, recalls, &ldquo;They had a vision and Stella [Ruata, the accomplished beader and co-founder of Artistic Hand Beading] made it come to life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Hermes Pan, dancer who worked with Fred Astaire, &ldquo;Hermes Pan: The Man Who Danced with Fred Astaire&rdquo; biography</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In spring 1983, Pan was feeding his cat (which he named &quot;Kitty&quot;) when he received a call from Fred Astaire asking him to come to his home immediately. Thinking it was some kind of emergency, Hermes rushed over only to find Astaire excitedly watching a videotape. &quot;Just wait till you see this,&quot; he said by way of greeting. Pan sat beside him and the two watched Michael Jackson perform Billie Jean on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, which had aired the night before. Impressed by the performance, Pan persuaded Astaire to call Michael Jackson to congratulate him. Hermes explained:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Somehow, Fred tracked [Michael] down. He told him that he was one hell of a dancer... &#39;You really put them on their asses last night. You&#39;re an angry dancer. I&#39;m the same way.&#39; I got on the line to say hello, and this whisper of a voice answered me. I was surprised, actually, that a person that dances with such anger would have such a soft voice. I told him how much I enjoyed his work, and he was very gracious, very excited to hear from us. For a moment, he thought it was a practical joke. I liked him right away because he seemed so unaffected by show business, and also star struck. He really could not believe that Fred Astaire had called him.&quot;</span></p></body>
