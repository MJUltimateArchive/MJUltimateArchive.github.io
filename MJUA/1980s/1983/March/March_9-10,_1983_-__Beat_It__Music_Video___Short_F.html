He&#39;s nervous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He looks approvingly at members of local gangs mixing it up with a handful of dancers in the noisy room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is the video we&#39;re making &#39;Beat It&#39;&quot;, he offers in a near whisper. &quot;The theme of my song is about two gangs coming together to rumble, in fight. And my objective is to tell them to turn the other cheek. It&#39;s like I&#39;m coming in between them saying, &#39;Hey, man, don&#39;t fight! These guys are your brothers!&#39; I do it through an aggressive beat and lots of rhythm and dancing and everything. You see these guys? Most of them are real gang members. There are a few dancers integrated, but mainly, it&#39;s the real thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With his record company literally releasing one song after another off Michael&#39;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album, only to watch them stumble over each other on the way to Number One, it&#39;s something of a surprise to watch Michael&#39;s obvious discomfort over the whole phenomenon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Now don&#39;t misrepresent me here!&quot;, Michael says with understandable caution. &quot;I love my fans, everyone who buys my records. From the heart of my work, I appreciate the fact that they enjoy what I&#39;m doing musically.&quot; He glances around the hectic room. &quot;It&#39;s just that all this has put me much more in contact with people. I get afraid of people sometimes. It&#39;s a whole other life, mixing it up with people, and I haven&#39;t really experienced that. I&#39;m just beginning to understand what the word friendship means I was raised on stage and that&#39;s where I am still the most comfortable. Anything else is foreign to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Painfully shy, Michael employs both a bodyguard and an assistant who travel with him at all times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I never open the front door to my house anymore&quot;, he admits with a tinge of sadness. &quot;I&#39;m just beginning to know and learn about people and friendships. I know nothing about the streets. I&#39;ve always had tutors or gone in spurts to private schools. When I was real little, my brothers and I tried to go to public school—for one week! It got so bad. The fans would come into the classroom and chase us around. It kinda scared me. I didn&#39;t know what people wanted from me!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, success has forced Michael out into the open. He&#39;s just too big a celebrity to hide out anymore. Although some of his first cherished friendships seem to be with people in the entertainment industry, &quot;because we understand each other better&quot;, Michael is definitely on the road to trusting in the comfort of companionship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Quincy Jones is a good friend&quot;, he says proudly. &quot;There are others too, Liza Minnelli and I are grat buddies! I love her. Also, Jane Fonda is my friend. I realized how much we had come to like each other the night her father Henry died. I called her up to try and say something consoling, and she asked me if I&#39;d like to come over and hang out with the family and friends. There was a time in my life that I could never have done that. But I went there and it was a very special evening.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Of course, one of my best friends in the world is Diana Ross. She&#39;s a good friend, a very dear friend. She&#39;s the kind of person I can tell anything to—the most private of secrets! And she tells me her secrets as well. Sometimes, I tell her I&#39;m going to marry her. Our relationship goes on forever.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although the friendship ties may be new territory for Michael, family ties aren&#39;t. Having only recently finished the project of tearing his parents&#39; Encino home &quot;down to the ground&quot; in order to rebuild it in castle form, Michael is very excited about the results.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s just great! I&#39;ve always loved English Tudor and I tend to fantasize a lot. I like princes and all that storybook stuff. Right now, I&#39;ve got some people from Disney Studios doing a whole thing in my house, recreating the kind of thing they did for their Pirates of the Caribbean ride—rooms where you walk in and there&#39;s a pirate shootout and robots that talk and sing and dance and shoot guns! You walk in the middle of this whole war going on. There&#39;s smoke and cannons. It&#39;s so exciting.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No one ever said Michael Jackson was your average kid! And no one ever will. And what does this year&#39;s most celebrated soul-rocker like to listen to when he isn&#39;t making his own music?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Classical music&quot;, he answers, noting out astonishment. &quot;Honestly. People come around and they&#39;re surprised, but that&#39;s what I listen to all the time. I sleep to it too. I just love it. The only time I listen to R&amp;B or rock is on Sundays when I&#39;m into my routine of fasting and dancing. I do that for my body. But for my head, it&#39;s classical music.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/20/michael-jackson-classic-interview"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Creem&rdquo; magazine (June 1983)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913223735/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/20/michael-jackson-classic-interview"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Downtown, between the Pacific American Fish Co and the Hotel St Agnes Hospitality Kitchen, there&#39;s an alley. Cars block each end, no escape. And silhouetted in the car headlights, two rival LA gangs are swaggering towards each other. A couple of people pop their heads out of the hotel window, mutter something incomprehensible and go back to sleep. Down below in the smoke, the gangs are getting closer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then out of the corner of your eye you spot a lot of people standing around with cameras. What&#39;s this? Have they started putting the Pacific American Fish Co on those maps they give Japanese tourists? You know, Disneyland, Marineland, Gangland? Then you notice the movie cameras half hidden in the smoke. Ah, I&#39;ve got it. A sequence for That&#39;s Incredible, right? &quot;OK, Skip, you&#39;re going to tell us about real people who beat the shit out of each other EVERY DAY!&quot; I can see them now, micing up the bodies, tapping them with rubber sticks for the soundcheck &ndash; &quot;Hey Joe, a little more middle on the ribs please! we&#39;re getting awful feedback on those kneebones &hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I wouldn&#39;t want to mess with this bunch. Those gangs look mean. Those Crips, the ones with the blue bandanas, look really mean, slapping their fists in their hands and scowling and getting closer and &ndash; &quot;CUT! OK, back to your places. Excuse me? EXCUSE ME? Thugs on the left? You sir, a teeeeeensy bit more knuckle-cracking. Perfect. ACTION!&quot; &ndash; someone switches on a tape machine and a bit of Beat It blares out into the night. A woman bawls something rude off a balcony. The man with the Jordache look and a can of instant atmosphere ignores it and puffs some more into the alley. The gangs start swaggering towards each other once again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Magic,&quot; says Michael Jackson, who talks a lot about magic, &quot;is easy if you put your heart into it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There can&#39;t be that many things much more magic than standing around in downtown LA in the middle of the night watching marauding hordes stand to attention when someone with a fruity English accent gives the command.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This particular bit of sorcery will, by the time you read this, be the video for Michael Jackson&#39;s new single. You know, the one with the Eddie Van Halen guitar on it. The follow-up to the one about paternity suits. This one&#39;s about machismo; so&#39;s the video. Michael wakes up in some sleazy downtown bedroom in a cold sweat; he&#39;s had a dream about the upcoming punch-up and has to go stop it. He leaps out of bed, seriously endangering the lives of a whole family of cockroaches, and heads downtown to the Empty Food Warehouse for the grand finale.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Which is where we&#39;re heading now: the film crew, the Japanese tourists, the Fruity English accents, the Rival Gangs and the Stars. Everyone&#39;s there; even the cockroaches. Someone&#39;s escorting us through the cardboard boxes and the cartons and explaining how Michael&#39;s going to meet up with the gangs right here for some killer choreography &ndash; &quot;It&#39;s difficult to look at cartons and be creative&quot; &ndash; and it looked great in rehearsal. Apocalypse Now between the liquid shortening and stuffed Spanish olives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But first they&#39;ve got to shoot the gangs leaping out from behind the boxes looking mean. They do this several million times, the gangs (favoured fashion for punch-ups: black shades, tennis shoes, bandannas, woolly hats) looking meaner by the take. Just as they&#39;re getting it right, they have to stop filming while a freight train comes through. Time for a tea break. They&#39;ve got tables filled with food outside (favoured gangland food: fruit salad, soft drinks &ndash; after all, the video&#39;s being done by the people who did the Dr. Pepper commercials) and beverages. Gives a whole new meaning to &quot;coffee mug&quot;. The gangs queue up in neat little lines and chat over the buffet. Nice civilised folks; one of them told me he was only a temporary member; he really wants to be an actor; another one swore they were the real thing, showed me scars and reckoned they were paid more tonight as extras than in a good night&#39;s street crime.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back in the warehouse they&#39;re doing the choreographed fight sequence. The real gang members stand on the edges while a dozen or so imitation gang members &ndash; professional dancers &ndash; dance and wave knives. It looks perfect first time, but they make them do it again and again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All this time, a thin, long-fingered man in a brown leather jacket too big for him is sipping orange juice, gazing wide-eyed and curious at the dancers and the monitors, nodding his head soberly in time to the music, his foot on automatic tap. Michael Jackson looks fascinated by the whole thing. It&#39;s three in the morning before he gets his go. He&#39;s to come in, break up the fight and lead them dancing out of a warehouse. Pied Piper meets Peter Pan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dawn was breaking by the time they finished; Michael Jackson wasn&#39;t. He&#39;s brilliant. Where the man gets his energy from no one knows. It&#39;s certainly not drugs &ndash; he doesn&#39;t touch them and rarely drinks. It&#39;s certainly not raw meat &ndash; Michael&#39;s a strict vegetarian and wouldn&#39;t eat at all, given an alternative; he fasts and dances every Sunday and manages to live to start another week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whatever, Michael Jackson manages to do more in a week than most manage in a decade. In the time it took Supertramp to get the right piano sound, Michael sang harmonies with Donna Summer, backing vocals with Joe &quot;King&quot; Carrasco (happened to be on the next studio at the time and was happy to oblige, once he translated it from Texan), wrote and produced Muscles for Diana Ross, wrote and sang The Girl Is Mine with Paul McCartney, and did a song for a narrated ET album, gathered together everyone from Vincent Price to Eddie Van Halen (&quot;Eddie was a great choice, because he&#39;s brilliant&quot;) to help out with his solo album, and still had time for his pet llama, snake and parrots.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just back from England (a couple more tunes with Macca, whom he met at a Hollywood cocktail party at silent comedian Harold Lloyd&#39;s place and swapped phone numbers: &quot;I love Paul, Linda and family very much.&quot;), he&#39;s already planning projects with Gladys Knight, Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand, Katherine Hepburn, and &ndash; let&#39;s stick with the girls! &ndash; Freddie Mercury of Queen, his old pal. Not to mention working on a film with Steven Spielberg (&quot;a futuristic fantasy with music&quot;) and an album with the Jacksons. Remember the Jacksons? Michael&#39;s been their singer and choreographer ever since his dad Joe &ndash; one-time head of a Chuck Berry cover band in Indiana, the Falcons &ndash; noticed the five-year-old&#39;s nifty James Brown impersonations. I mean, Michael was 11 years old when he had his first No 1 single!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s a mystery to Michael, too. &quot;Magic.&quot; The songs, ideas, energy come from God, he reckons &ndash; the man&#39;s a devoted Jehovah&#39;s Witness, He&#39;ll just wake up in the night and there they are. Several more million sellers. His first solo album, Off the Wall, sold seven million copies. Thriller&#39;s not exactly ready for the cutout bins yet. The first act in history, no less, to top the pop and R&amp;B singles and albums charts all at the same time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We didn&#39;t get to talk at the video. The Man at Epic threatened me with all sorts of violence if I approached Jackson during the shooting, and with those Crips backing him up, who&#39;s arguing? Seems during an earlier take a press person said something to Michael that gave him a fit of giggles (Oh No! Not the Freddie Mercury jokes, please!) and gave the film crew a very expensive break. But he did say he&#39;d pass on a questionnaire to the man at an opportune moment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Editor&rsquo;s Note</span><span class="csD5D7D290">:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 1982 interview that followed can be read <a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://mjultimatearchive.github.io/MJUA/1980s/1982/Summer_1982/Summer_1982_-_Creem_Magazine_Interview.html"><span class="cs8567212B">here</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here are the rest of the questionnaire questions/answers extracted from the 1982 interview:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyway, as we told you already he&#39;s going to be working on a film with Steven Spielberg. &quot;I </span><span class="cs43C038A">love </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Steven,&quot; says Michael in the questionnaire.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Just 10 minutes before writing this, Steven called me. He bought me a present! I can&#39;t really tell you anything about the project. I will say Steven is my favorite director, and that he&#39;s looked long and hard for the right property.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just heard that Francis Ford Coppola wants to do </span><span class="cs43C038A">Peter Pan </span><span class="csD5D7D290">with him as the lead. And we at </span><span class="cs43C038A">CREEM </span><span class="csD5D7D290">haven&#39;t seen such a blatant bit of typecasting since Sly Stone made his fortune playing mindless beefcake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How does he choose who he works with? Anybody who asks?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I choose by feeling and instinct,&quot; is Michael&#39;s [1983] questionnaire answer. What does he get out of them? &quot;I feel it would be...</span><span class="cs43C038A">magic</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.&quot; Then again, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind the man lives for his work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Moonwalk&rdquo; autobiography (1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; was directed by Bob Giraldi, who had done a lot of commercials. I remember being in England when it was decided that &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; would be the next single released from Thriller, and we had to choose a director for the video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I felt &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; should be interpreted literally, the way it was written, one gang against another on tough urban streets. It had to be rough. That&rsquo;s what &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; was about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I got back to L.A., I saw Bob Giraldi&rsquo;s demo reel and knew that he was the director I wanted for &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo; I loved the way he told a story in his work, so I talked with him about &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo; We went over things, my ideas and his ideas, and that&rsquo;s how it was created. We played with the storyboard and molded it and sculpted it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had street gangs on my mind when I wrote &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; so we rounded up some of the toughest gangs in Los Angeles and put them to work on the video. It turned out to be a good idea, and a great experience for me. We had some rough kids on that set, tough kids, and they hadn&rsquo;t been to wardrobe. Those guys in the pool room in the first scene were serious; they were not actors. That stuff was real.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now I hadn&rsquo;t been around really tough people all that much, and these guys were more than a little intimidating at first. But we had security around and were ready for anything that might happen. Of course we soon realized we didn&rsquo;t need any of this, that the gang members were mostly humble, sweet, and kind in their dealings with us. We fed them during breaks, and they all cleaned up and put their trays away. I came to realize that the whole thing about being bad and tough is that it&rsquo;s done for recognition. All along these guys had wanted to be seen and respected, and now we were going to put them on TV. They loved it. &ldquo;Hey, look at me, I&rsquo;m somebody!&rdquo; And I think that&rsquo;s really why many of the gangs act the way they do. They&rsquo;re rebels, but rebels who want attention and respect. Like all of us, they just want to be seen. And I gave them that chance. For a few days at least they were stars.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They were so wonderful to me&mdash;polite, quiet, supportive. After the dance numbers they&rsquo;d compliment my work, and I could tell they really meant it. They wanted a lot of autographs and frequently stood around my trailer. Whatever they wanted, I gave them: photographs, autographs, tickets for the Victory tour, anything. They were a nice bunch of guys.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The truth of that experience came out on the screen. The &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; video was menacing, and you could feel those people&rsquo;s emotions. You felt the experience of the streets and the reality of their lives. You look at &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; and know those kids are tough. They were being themselves, and it came across. It was nothing like actors acting; it was as far from that as possible. They were being themselves; that feeling you got was their spirit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;ve always wondered if they got the same message from the song that I did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/online/20090707/giraldibeatit.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Bob Giraldi, director, &ldquo;Boards Mag&rdquo; interview (July 7, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120328131555/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/online/20090707/giraldibeatit.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">How did you end up directing the video for &quot;Beat It&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As I was told, there was a certain spot that I directed in my early years as a commercial director for WLS-TV in Chicago, about two elderly blind people - a married couple - that didn&#39;t run from a neighborhood that all the other white folks fled from. It had become a very inner city, tough neighborhood and they chose to stay and throw a block party for all the young kids in the neighborhood. It was a commercial that Michael was really taken with - it was an emotional commercial, it was based on truth and he liked it a lot. So he wanted to meet and we met.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I wanted &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and he had just finished shooting &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, but he said he had this track called &quot;Beat It&quot; and maybe I&#39;d like to come up with an idea for that. In those days, you didn&#39;t compete [for videos]. There were no three bids - there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of politics. Record labels didn&#39;t have commissioners, it was a different business. It wasn&#39;t a business yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">What did you base the concept on?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the things that is totally mistaken that I&#39;ve read many times is that most people think &quot;Beat It&quot; was inspired by </span><span class="cs43C038A">West Side Story</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and that&#39;s absolutely not true at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I grew up in Paterson, New Jersey - always an edgy town but full of people really trying to be so much tougher than they really are. It seemed to me this song of peace, this song of reconciliation that Michael had written was perfect for a quasi kind of rumble. I&#39;ve read where, the two lead dancers - Michael Peters and Vince Paterson - when they had their wrists tied and held the switchblades, that came from </span><span class="cs43C038A">West Side Story</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. That&#39;s not true at all. That came from a story I heard when I worked in a factory one summer. A real tough kid from Jersey told me that he&#39;d witnessed two guys who had their wrists tied and they held switchblades, and only one came out - and not too well. It was based on that little fable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael liked my idea and decided he was going to include the Crips and Bloods, which I thought was insane. If you see the video, you&#39;ll see guys that look like the real deal because they are the real deal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">How did you cast the real gang members?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was Michael. He went out and he got &#39;em through, I guess, the LAPD&#39;s gang squad and he convinced them that, with enough police presence, this would be a smart and charitable thing to do; get them there to like each other and hang with each other for two days doing the video. I didn&#39;t like the idea because it was hard enough to direct actors and dancers, let alone hoods.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">So he tried to use the video to foster peace between them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was always about peace. He was always about some sort of peace offering. That was his idea and the cops did go along with it and as history has it, we were almost shut down the first night because, as you know, film sets get to be very boring after the first hour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I guess the Crips and Bloods started to get on each other&#39;s nerves - they are mortal enemies - and we had a few incidents and two cops came to me and said they wanted to close it down. I somehow convinced the cop squad guy to just let me [shoot the] dance. I was gonna hold the dance for the second night of shooting. I said, &#39;The only thing I can think that&#39;ll save this is to let me just blast the music. I have a feeling it&#39;ll calm everything down. Can&#39;t get any worse, just give me a chance.&#39; And the cop was cool, he looked at me and said, &#39;OK, not much more.&#39; I couldn&#39;t go much more because it was volatile - no question about it - and scary. So we were in that warehouse, change of plans we&#39;re going to do the dance, get Michael out of the camper, here we go.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">What happened next?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The gang members couldn&#39;t dance so they formed the ring and watched. And the [dancers] all started to dance with Michael Peters and Vince Paterson. When Michael Jackson comes down and does what he does, I remember looking at the faces of all the Crips and Bloods lined up and their expressions as they listened to that music and watched those kids dance. Those kids were basically, most of them were gay... and when they started to dance, the Crips and the Bloods had that look like, &#39;You know what? With all our wars and vendettas and stuff, that&#39;s cool right there. That&#39;s something we&#39;ll never be able to do.&#39; And that&#39;s what made that evening work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Did Michael Jackson choreograph the video himself?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That is the one time that I can honestly say Michael Jackson did not choreograph. &#39;Beat It&#39; was choreographed by Michael Peters - God rest his soul - a great, great choreographer who is no longer alive. He was an incredible street dancer, he choreographed that and Michael Jackson danced it and danced it beautifully. I think from that point on Michael Jackson probably was involved in the choreography in every single thing he did. &#39;Beat It&#39; was a little bit more belonging to Michael Peters than people want to give credit for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">In those days MTV had an unspoken policy of not playing videos by black artists. What impact did &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; have when they came out?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was taking video to another level with dance and choreography and the fact that Epic, CBS could put down on the desk that these two were the largest selling records in the world. It was hard for Les Garland and [Bob] Pittman to hold on to that original idea, which was [playing] new wave bands for white teens in the suburbs. Michael was given credit, and rightly so, for being the first really, truly crossover artist of our generation and the man who forced MTV by his genius to rethink it&#39;s platform.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">What impact has &quot;Beat It&quot; and working with Michael Jackson had on your career?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met a man who I have total respect for. One of the most interesting things he ever said to me, I&#39;ll never forget, we were arguing, he said to me in that very high-pitched voice of his, &#39;You use the F-word too much&#39;. That always stuck with me. I thought that was smart to say at a time like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I watched a man dance better than anyone I&#39;d ever seen in my life and I watched a man talk softly and carry a tremendously big stick, get what he wanted and get his way. And as we know now 25 years later, perhaps he got his way too much. But nonetheless, I watched him get his way but always using the softest, quietest approach you could possibly have used. I was influenced not only by his talent, but by his personality.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/michael-jacksons-20-greatest-videos-the-stories-behind-the-vision-20140624/7-beat-it-1983-0613301"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (June 24, 2014)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If &quot;Billie Jean&quot; established what Michael&#39;s feet could do, &quot;Beat It&quot; took care of the rest &ndash; the red leather jacket, the mix of sensitive and macho, the movie-musical choreography, a fame so massive it seemed to engulf the pop world itself. Director Bob Giraldi gave the video its edge, thanks to a knife-fight climax. &quot;On the second take, I gave a real switchblade to my AD and told him to quietly substitute it for the dancer&#39;s rubber knife,&quot; said Giraldi. &quot;[The other dancers] were backing away from the knives &ndash; really backing away &ndash; because they were actually afraid.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104636/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/bobgiraldi.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Record&rdquo; magazine (October 1983)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Record&quot; magazine (RM): How did you land the Michael Jackson &quot;Beat It&quot; project?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob Giraldi: I had listened to his record and wanted to do the &quot;Billie Jean&quot; video, but his managers had already lined up a British director for it. After they decided that &quot;Beat It&quot; would be done by somebody else! So, I was in Santo Domingo with my family, Antony was in New York, Michael was in California, and we kept trying to call each other. Did you ever try to call anybody in Santo Domingo? One day my wife picked up the phone and she hears (speaks in a falsetto voice) &quot;Hello, is Bob there?&quot; It was Michael Jackson. She puts the phone down and says, &quot;Bob, Michael sounds like a girl!&quot; I said, &quot;Well, he certainly doesn&#39;t dance like one.&quot; Anyway, we talked, and he told me it was a go. He said the song to him was nothing more than turning the other cheek. Michael Jackson&#39;s never been in a gang war; Michael Jackson&#39;s probably never been out of that house. I think the world knows he&#39;s been watched and protected all his life. He just said, &quot;Let&#39;s do something street.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RM: Who brought the street gangs to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Giraldi: They were brought to us by a combination of the Los Angeles police department, my production company and (Jackson&#39;s former manager) Ron Weisner. The police warned us to be very careful. We were, and I&#39;ve never had a more wonderful experience in my life as a director than watching these tough gangs. They were taking my direction, but they were skeptical, dubious. Watching the dance sequence start to happen, they looked at each other as if to say, &quot;Holy shit, now there&#39;s some of our brothers doing something that none of us will ever be able to do.&quot; And they found from the piece another kind of macho. From that point on, we were home free.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RM: In both &quot;Beat It&quot; and the &quot;Pieces of Ice&quot; video you did with Diana Ross, there&#39;s overtones of violence. As a director, do you find violence appealing in some way?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Giraldi: I dream about making love much more than I do about fighting. No, I think that&#39;s really a result of the two songs I picked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RM: Do you approve of violence in music videos?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Giraldi: I think violence sucks. The whole beauty of &quot;Beat It&quot; is how it shows that the macho trip is bullshit. I had peace come through in this magical, mystical creature named Michael Jackson. Obviously, if anybody ever analyzes it properly, they will see that it&#39;s anti-violence, not pro-violence. In Diana&#39;s case, I think &quot;Pieces of Ice&quot; is about a figment of her imagination and dreams. The visions and illusions turn out to be fine with dance and all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...RM: How important is the song in your creation of concepts for music video?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Giraldi: Totally important. That&#39;s one of the reasons my work has been considered clear and to the point. I believe the script is what it&#39;s about, unlike my English brothers who seem to get off on surreal images and making you fill in your own idea of what the piece is. The closest I come to that is &quot;Pieces of Ice&quot;, because it&#39;s that kind of song. &quot;Beat It&quot; is more literal; &quot;Pieces of Ice&quot; is more literal; &quot;Piece of Ice&quot; is more abstract, dream-like.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...RM: You have a &quot;no frills&quot; approach to cutting and producing pieces. To date, music videos have been very special effects oriented—</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Giraldi: But nobody would have done music videos in the professional arena if you didn&#39;t have the kids, the young filmmakers, doing those special effects. I think we professionals are going to ruin MTV because we&#39;ll make it another wonderful media communication form. Last year and the year before and maybe for another year, it&#39;s still very special and very much a kids medium. The reason it&#39;s successful is that kids say, &quot;Enough of your commercials, enough of your movies that make a lot of money, enough of your slick TV shows, enough of all the shit I see on billboards and in magazines. We have our own station and we can do anything—we can piss on it, we can do special effects. We can do things that are amateurish and silly. And you know what? The more amateurish it is, the more it&#39;s ours and the more it&#39;s not yours.&quot; It&#39;s very important for the professional artist to understand this. I was scared to death that &quot;Beat It&quot; was too professional, too slick, that kids would say they didn&#39;t want it. Put it on another station, put it in a commercial, do a Dr. Pepper commercial, do a commercial for &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, but leave us alone. But it didn&#39;t happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104642/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/newclip83.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Daily News, &quot;Rock Video&#39;s Star Directors&quot; (August 28, 1983)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 42-year-old Giraldi, who in his tenure as doyen of Madison Avenue directors once made Bubba Smith do 60 takes tearing open a beer can, is not intimidated by such clients as Diana Ross or the admittedly &quot;wonderful, mystical&quot; Jackson: &quot;I don&#39;t want to sound pompous&quot;, he says, &quot;but there&#39;s only one star on my sets.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jackson had held talks with Giraldi about making the video to his hit &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, but they couldn&#39;t close the deal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When it came time to make &quot;Beat It&quot;, a hammering rocker with a message for the ghetto (&quot;Don&#39;t wanna see no blood, don&#39;t be a macho man&quot;), Jackson called the vacationing Giraldi in Santo Domingo. &quot;So I&#39;m sitting on the beach with my wife, Marian, listening to the song about 50 times&quot;, says Giraldi, &quot;and reminiscing—she was my childhood sweetheart in a tough neighborhood in Paterson—about that silly, wasteful macho thing we grew up with. I came up with this vision of authentic gang members in this Los Angeles barrio and bringing peace to them through dance, and Michael&#39;s almost mystical—[cut off] just jumped up and down and said, &#39;Let&#39;s go do it!&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Giraldi put Jackson together with choreographer Michael Peters (a Tony winner for &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, he appears in &quot;Beat It&quot; as the white-jacketed leader of an actual gang called the East Coast Crips), and Peters married Jackson&#39;s flashy, instinctually syncopated style with his own high-kicking repertoire. By the time Jackson steps in to break up the stylized knife fight between Peters and dancer Vince Paterson, even MTV&#39;s white-bread target audience must know it&#39;s seeing a mixture of raw entertainment and social consciousness. The combination puts this video on a plateau by itself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/25/Personality-SpotlightNEWLNMichael-Jackson-SuperstarNEWLNShyness-makes-millionaire-singer-an-anachronism-in-celebrityville/4720441176400/"><span class="cs8567212B">UPI (December 25, 1983)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;[Michael and Diana Ross] have a friendship as genuine as any I&#39;ve seen,&#39; says Bob Giraldi, director of his &#39;Beat It&#39; and &#39;Billie Jean&#39; videos in addition to Miss Ross&#39; flashy videos. &#39;On the set Diana would say, &#39;What would Michael think of this?&#39; Michael would say, &#39;What would Diana do with this?&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Peters, choreographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110104/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/focus.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Right On!

Peters says: that he worked with Michael for about two hours before he was called in for a camera setup, but that the tension on the set was something everyone was feeling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The gangs were sort of on the periphery of the location&quot;, Peters explains, &quot;so Michael really didn&rsquo;t have to deal with them. He was a little nervous, as we all were at the beginning. But he was quite wonderful with them. I think the turning point was when the gangs saw us dance. They had, I think, a different respect after that. If we needed Michael, he&#39;d be out there and if not, he was in his trailer. But he signed autographs and took pictures with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Peters says that he has had much experience with non-dancers and for that reason accepted gladly the challenge to choreograph the gang members for &ldquo;Beat It.&rdquo; He said when the shooting was over, the street kids were applauding and that he felt great satisfaction at having brought something out of people who weren&#39;t sure how much of themselves they could give as dancers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Vincent Paterson, one of the two fighter dancers, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.gaycitynews.com/choreographer-supreme/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vincent Paterson: Master of All Media&rdquo; (January 13, 2006)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200415185958/https://www.gaycitynews.com/choreographer-supreme/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pennsylvania-born Paterson was thrown out of ballet class as a youngster but persevered as a dancer, and, when it came time to audition for Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; video, did so, as an actor, rather than a dancer, dressing like a gang member, rather than the usual tights and leg warmers. Jackson said, &ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; and a friendship was forged, with Paterson quickly graduating to full director of the star&rsquo;s videos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-064-vincent-paterson-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 064, &ldquo;Vincent Paterson Special&rdquo; (August 28, 2017)</span></a></span><span class="csE52E8F9B"> </span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vincent Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When I auditioned for &quot;Beat It&quot;—you want to hear that story?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q (The MJCast):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh yeah!</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [Laughs] Okay, well, this is—it kind of, the whole thing is as I&#39;m talking, I&#39;m seeing if it&#39;s making sense. But I heard—Michael Peters told me, he said &quot;I can&#39;t give you the gig, but you&#39;ve got to come in and audition, and Michael Jackson&#39;s gonna decide who&#39;s going to be in it&quot;. I said, &quot;That&#39;s fine, man, I don&#39;t mind&quot;. So, having been an actor, I knew it was about gangs. So, I came into the audition sort of dressed similar to what I look like in the video as the white gang leader with the knife fight guy. So, I came in with, like, scruffy beard, and my hair was a little greasy, and I had an earring, and I wore jeans, and I had a little jacket, and all the other guys came in like dancers. They had tight pants on, and tank tops on, and leg warmers on, and little jazz shoes. So, it&#39;s very hard to look like a gang guy in a pink tank top and jazz shoes and leg warmers, you know? [Laughs]</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it depends what kind of gang, doesn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [Laughs] Exactly. I don&#39;t think that was the kind of gang they were looking for though, for this shoot [laughs] So, I did notice that when I came in, before we even started dancing, that Michael Jackson&#39;s eyes kind of like went towards me, and he spoke to Michael Peters. &quot;Who&#39;s that guy?&quot; So, luckily, I could dance, and I could back up the look. So, I got that gig.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I guess—when you sort of worked first with him in the &quot;Beat It&quot; time, he&#39;d just come off a big tour with his brothers, he just launched the &quot;Thriller&quot; album, which was doing gangbusters, and he had been in the media already at that point. Did you have any perceptions of Michael Jackson before getting to work with him?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I didn&#39;t, and he—even though you say all of those things, there weren&#39;t people running around chasing Michael Jackson. During those time periods—we worked at just a big dance studio over in the valley over here, San Fernando Valley, at a studio called Debbie Reynolds. And he would come—I think he would only come with a guy who was kind of—I want to say bodyguard but he was a little older than a bodyguard. And he was kind of just a personal friend. His name was Bill Bray.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh yeah, the guy with the hat.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, Bill. And so, to come to these rehearsals, it would just be Michael and Bill Bray. And then Bill Bray would wait out in the car or something, and it would just be Michael in the room with Michael Peters and me, and playing, and working, and hanging, and being crazy... Yeah, it wasn&#39;t the &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; that we all sort of think of, you know. He was not followed by stars, there were not people standing out there to sign autographs, you know. And after &quot;Beat It&quot;, we went back to the same studio to do &quot;Thriller&quot;, and there were a few more people around, and this time Michael would be stopped by people in the hallways, and going out to the car and stuff to sign autographs. But yeah, it was after &quot;Beat It&quot; really, when his star began to really rise and people started to notice him, and really take notice of him and follow him, and the mobs began. You could watch it through the ages, you know.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jamon:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Tell us a bit more about the &quot;Beat It&quot; shoot. Do you remember the first thing Michael &nbsp;said to you on the shoot, and what you guys talked about?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, uhh, no. I don&#39;t remember all that stuff. I mean, come on, this is like 8,000 years ago... The reason Michael and I got along so well, I have to say, is I&#39;ve never been somebody who&#39;s wanted to become super close friends with celebrities, only because so many people try to do that. And it&#39;s usually because they want something. And I never wanted anything from Michael or any of the celebrities I worked with, other than perhaps having the opportunity to create more things together, collaborate on more projects. But one of the reasons that we did work so well together is because we both had a lot of the similar senses of humor, and we&#39;re both kind of kids at heart, and we&#39;re both basically nice people... Michael would be so shy, he&#39;d want to be in his trailer all the time, and I would go knock on the door and go in, and I&#39;d say, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s walk outside. Let&#39;s walk in the middle of everything.&quot; And he&#39;d go, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know&quot;, and I&#39;d say &quot;No, come on, come on. If you don&#39;t like it, if it&#39;s horrible, we&#39;ll come back.&quot; &quot;Okay, okay&quot; So, then we&#39;d go out, and we&#39;d hang out, and we&#39;d talk—and I&#39;ll give you one really cool story that happened on &quot;Beat It&quot; set. He and I were standing together, waiting for one of the shots to be set up, I don&#39;t remember which one. And I&#39;m talking to him, and we&#39;re standing kind of over towards—on the sidewalk, near some buildings. And I noticed there&#39;s something dripping on his shoulder, but he has that red coat on. So, I said, &quot;What&#39;s that dripping on your shoulder?&quot;, and I put my finger in it, and it was blood. And we looked up, and here was this guy who had been shot or stabbed, I don&#39;t know, crawling from out of a window onto the fire escape, and crawling up one level of fire escape, and crawling into another window. And before we could even do anything, and it was crazy, we both just looked at each other, and kind of &quot;Oh my God, we </span><span class="cs43C038A">are </span><span class="csD5D7D290">in downtown LA&quot;. This is not just a short film, this is reality.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We&#39;re not in Kansas anymore, Toto.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Paterson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Exactly, you got it. You got it. So, that was an interesting adventure that happened. But the rest was a typical film shoot, you prep yourself, you do your work and you do it again, and you do it again, and you do it again, and you do—25 takes later, and you&#39;re still doing the same thing, and every time you do it, you have to pretend like it&#39;s the first time. But it was great, and always dancing next to Michael was more than exciting. He just had this unbelievable electricity, I guess I could say, that just flowed, shot off his body, and you sort of were zapped by it if you were anywhere near it, and when you think about—and I&#39;m being honest, I&#39;m not being egocentric, I&#39;m being honest. Now he was not a trained, trained dancer. He trained some stuff with the Motown people, I&#39;m sure. He knew tap well, and he worked every Sunday with a bunch of street dancers as time went on, and perfected his whole personal &quot;street look&quot; choreography, but he was not a trained dancer. He didn&#39;t take jazz and ballet and all of those things that the rest of us who surrounded him did in those videos, but if you look at him, and you look at us, it&#39;s—there&#39;s no difference. I mean, it&#39;s as if he has trained every single day for 25 years, like anybody else there. Phenomenal, just phenomenal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Ebony/JET Celebrity Showcase&rdquo; Interview:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Ebony/JET Celebrity Showcase&rdquo; interview transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: The film is about two gangs.
