Merseyside Police drafted in 500 extra offices, but the night went off with few problems.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Singer Kim Wilde was the support act, and Jackson&rsquo;s two hour set included a Beatles medley, in tribute to his Liverpool heroes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Biggest concert of the tour was staged at Liverpool&rsquo;s Aintree Racecourse (home of the famous Grand National steeplechase) on 11th September 1988 &ndash; 125,000 fans attended. &lsquo;I have always considered Liverpool the home of contemporary pop music,&rsquo; Michael told the press, &lsquo;by virtue of its being the birth place of the incomparable Beatles.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s management tried negotiating a deal with BBC TV to air the Aintree show live. However, that same day Sports Aid had organised a free concert in Hyde Park where some 250,000 people were expected to turn up. The event was set to coincide with Sport Aid&rsquo;s Race Against Time run across London. When the organisers heard of Michael&rsquo;s plans they feared their event would be affected. In the end no deal could be struck and Michael&rsquo;s Aintree show wasn&rsquo;t televised.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">3,000 people needed treatment for minor injuries during the show, due to crushing as fans pushed and shoved as Michael came on stage. St John&rsquo;s ambulance reported there were no serious injuries, with only 40 going to hospital as precautionary measures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Thank you very much to all the fans in the United Kingdom. I look forward to seeing you again in the near future. The tour was a wonderful experience. I love you all. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
