When not dumbfounded, the fans cheered and waved their arms in response to the Gifted One&#39;s world-class talent and showmanship.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During a backstage visit with Jackson in his dressing room, JET observed that the modest musical marvel was beaming with happiness and savored the fact that he was on his own and in complete control.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s quite different because its myself, and I&#39;m usually used to the brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Randy). So, I feel like I have to really carry my own now,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson began his solo career by recruiting the best musicians, singers, and dancers to accompany him on his world tour. Some of the 15 members of his troupe were in films and videos with him. The others were handpicked and auditioned. Standing at the highest plateau of his career since it was launched 24 years ago in his Gary, Ind., hometown where he sang Climb Every Mountain in his kindergarten class. Jackson says he has not given much thought to his solo status. &quot;I feel there is so much more. I&#39;m trying not to think too hard about what I&#39;ve done already. There are so many new grounds to break,&quot; he allowed. The best thing about being on his own is the &quot;individuality&quot; which he now enjoys. &quot;I can do what I want to do without going through voting (with his musical family, The Jacksons),&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Comparing his opening on the U.S. leg of his world tour with his debut in Japan, Jackson observed: &quot;The fact that America is the entertainment capital of the world, you always feel you have to do much more because it seems like America has seen it all. So I thought I had to come through much stronger.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Discussing his Bad album sales, Jackson said, &quot;We&#39;ve sold 13 million and have three best-selling singles. Thriller has had only two No. 1 singles&mdash;Beat It and Billie Jean.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bad&#39;s blockbuster message song, &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;, is very special to Jackson. &quot;It was my concept,&quot; he said, &quot;It was in Hong Kong that I called Frank (Dileo, his manager) and told him what I wanted to do. I wanted to show Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, (John F.) Kennedy, opening with the starving child.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The genius of entertainment important said that his staff was &quot;very helpful in compiling all this wonderful footage together, but they followed my vision on it. I wanted to touch people.&quot; The &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; video &quot;makes you want to do something, which is the most important thing when you look at it&quot;, he stated.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lisa Robinson, &ldquo;There Goes Gravity: A Life in Rock and Roll&rdquo;, autobiography</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On February 23, 1988, I went to Kansas City for the opening night of Michael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; tour. His manager Frank DiLeo arranged for me to visit Michael&rsquo;s suite at the Westin Crowne Hotel after the show. Alone. There were no handlers present, no family members, no animal companions, no child companions, no bodyguards&mdash;unusual for a Jackson visitation. For Kansas City, his suite was lavish, the size of a small apartment. But as I entered, let in by a security guard who waited outside the door, Michael was nowhere to be seen. &ldquo;Michael?&rdquo; I called, as I walked around. After a few minutes, I heard giggling from behind a door. The twenty-nine year-old Michael Jackson was playing hide-and-seek. Finally, he appeared, wearing black trousers and a bright red shirt, his semi-straightened hair pulled back into a loose ponytail with a few strands falling over his face. He hugged me. He was taller than I&rsquo;d remembered, taller than he appeared in photos. And while his giggling continued, I remember thinking at the time that his hug was a hug from a man&mdash;not a boy. There was nothing sexual about it, it was just strong. Then he pulled back, looked at me and said, in the lower and more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; of the two voices he could produce at will, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that smell? What&rsquo;s that perfume? I know that smell.&rdquo; I laughed and said, &ldquo;Oh Michael, you don&rsquo;t know this perfume. It&rsquo;s an old drag queen perfume from the 1950s.&rdquo; At the words &ldquo;drag queen&rdquo; he started giggling and repeated it: &ldquo;Drag queen . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">hahahahahaha!!! No, I know it. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Jungle Gardenia,&rsquo; right?&rdquo; I was taken aback. How did he know that? I told him that the only people who ever recognized this perfume were Bryan Ferry and Duran Duran&rsquo;s Nick Rhodes. Well, I said, I guess you&rsquo;re not as la-la as they say you are. The words &ldquo;la-la&rdquo; cracked him up and he repeated it . . . &ldquo;La-la . . . hahahahaha!&rdquo; A week later I sent a case of twenty-four bottles of &ldquo;Jungle Gardenia&rdquo; to his hotel suite at New York City&rsquo;s Helmsley Palace. And on March 2nd, I stood backstage in the wings at the Grammy Awards live telecast in Radio City Music Hall, while Michael waited with a gospel group, about to perform &ldquo;Man in the Mirror.&rdquo; Looking at me he whispered, &ldquo;Thanks for the smells. . . . I&rsquo;m wearing it now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2009/09/michael-jackson200909"><span class="cs8567212B">Vanity Fair (September 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Westin Crown Center Hotel, Kansas City, Missouri, February 23, 1988: Michael Jackson had just finished the opening night of his </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> tour and his manager, Frank DiLeo, arranged for me to visit the star in his hotel suite. No handlers, no bodyguards, no hangers-on, no family members&mdash;unusual for a Jackson visitation&mdash;but we&rsquo;d had a friendly journalist-to-artist relationship for the past 16 years, and Michael asked to see me. For Kansas City, the suite was lavish, the size of a small apartment, but as I entered, let in by a security guard, Michael was nowhere to be seen. &ldquo;Michael?,&rdquo; I called as I walked around. After a few minutes, I heard giggling from behind a door. The 29-year-old Michael Jackson was literally playing hide-and-seek. Eventually he appeared, wearing black trousers and a bright-red shirt, his semi-straightened hair in a loose ponytail with a few strands falling over his face. He hugged me. He was taller than I&rsquo;d remembered, taller than he appeared in photos, and while his giggling continued, I thought that the hug was a hug from a man&mdash;not a boy&mdash;and while there was nothing sexual, it just was strong.

It was the most remarkable thing I&#39;d ever seen. It really was mind-blowing.</span></p></body>
