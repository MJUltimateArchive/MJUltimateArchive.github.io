Al Brodax, who made the still-delightful &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; is planning an animated musical called &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; while Michael Jackson, who owns the Beatles publishing catalogue, is reportedly contemplating feature-length films inspired by &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; and &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.21stcenturyradio.com/NP-9-7-99.1.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;21st Century Radio&quot; (March 6, 1994)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111134902/http://www.21stcenturyradio.com/NP-9-7-99.1.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BH: Now, we understand that you&#39;re still very much involved in future projects on Beatle subjects. Could you tell us a little about &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;, and your work on publishing material about a, hopefully publishing some more material on the Yellow Submarine? &#39;Cause you&#39;re the guy to do it Al.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AB: The &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; project started some years ago, but it was brought to me..., I was in England at the time doing what they call a &quot;reckie&quot; over there, looking for a sight for a picture I was going to do for Cornwall this spring, hopefully. And I was called back from England to do the &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; project by ITC Investron. Vestron has since gone bankrupt, ITC is not in very good shape. And they wanted me to produce it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I chose the computer graphics lab out on the Island as the place, they are the avant-garde of computer graphics. And I thought it was just the perfect medium for Beatles songs. And so the production did start, but the thing was that the Beatles didn&#39;t like the idea. They didn&#39;t like the idea because basically Paul was miffed at Michael Jackson because he bought their music library you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BH: Yea, there was some discussion...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AB: For 35 million dollars he bought the publishing rights. Now Paul&#39;s wanting to buy it back, I think for 150 million, but anyway, they really didn&#39;t want their songs covered, you know using other artists, by anybody. And they didn&#39;t want their stuff out but I had to proceed with this production, I was called into it. So we had other people, and we actually made tracks of Luther Vandross and Cindi Lauper and actually Michael Jackson singing &quot;Get Together&quot; oh, &quot;Come Together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BH: &quot;Come Together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AB: So we had eight marvelous tracks and then everything went wrong. By that I mean Vestron went bankrupt, ITC was in bad shape and the lab got into trouble with the Government. And so it was padlocked and it&#39;s on hold. Which is sad, because a lot of good stuff was done. And now it&#39;s just in the courts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Tommy Shannon, bassist of contributing band &ldquo;Double Trouble&rdquo; <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.djnoble.demon.co.uk/ints/STEVIER.AYV.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Guitar Magazine&rdquo; (January 1996)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160805152646/http://www.djnoble.demon.co.uk/ints/STEVIER.AYV.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">`Several years ago, it was either `86 or `87, Michael Jackson was doing an animated movie for which he wanted to use all Beatles songs,&#39; recalls Tommy Shannon, Double Trouble bassist and Stevie&#39;s longtime friend. `All these different musicians were doing Beatles&#39; songs so we did `Taxman&#39;. Something happened and the movie never came out so it&#39;s been sitting in the can for several years.
