This was the day after Thanksgiving. We met in the attic of [Jackson manager] Frank DiLeo&#39;s home in Encino &ndash; even just the attic was a palace. So, Michael and I sat down and just started making a list of things that we could think of. I had two or three handwritten pages of ideas. Michael wasn&#39;t the kind of guy who told you what to do, he would inspire you to go do it with his backing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I went to all these places that have archival news footage and say, &#39;Give me all your worst stuff.&#39; And by the end of the day, I&#39;d looked at dead bodies and massacres and famine. After a while, I would go to a bar &ndash; immediately. It was brutal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I probably had 200 hours of footage. My goal kind of was, if you could take the video and play it in reverse, it starts from the planet out in space and then a child in an incubator and then young children; and by the time you get to the end of the video, all hell&#39;s broken loose. It&#39;s just sort of man&#39;s laziness about doing things. I&#39;m gonna make this thing out of 80 percent news footage that people have already seen and they change the channel because it&#39;s too hard to watch, or it&#39;s too boring. I&#39;m gonna use the same stuff and make them go, &#39;Wow, I&#39;ve never seen that before.&#39; Oh yeah, you have.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before Michael passed we were actually thinking about doing an updated version. I would have hated to do it and not be better, which is kinda the reason I didn&#39;t go for it. That thing was so magical in a weird kind of way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.americanpopularculture.com/archive/music/wilson.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">Magazine Americana (June 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Americana: With the recent passing of Michael Jackson, TV stations such as VH1 and MTV have been playing Jackson video retrospectives. One of the most revered is your &quot;Man in the Mirror.&quot; How does that make you feel?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don Wilson: Regarding the video, it was a life and career changing thing. A friend played the newly released </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> record for me on a Walkman with small speakers and when I heard &quot;Man in the Mirror,&quot; I was blown away and told my friend that the song would be huge. I couldn&#39;t get it out of my head. As fate would have it, I got a call to meet with Michael the day after Thanksgiving 1987 to talk about doing a video for the song, so, needless to say, it was a magical thing for me. It was an honor to be chosen to do the video and a task I did not take lightly. As I traveled from city to city looking for the footage, I realized the task was a big one. I soon understood that much of the footage had been seen on news programs, and I needed to present it in a way that made it compelling and watchable. I decided to make the video &quot;reversible.&quot; What I mean is if one were to play the video in reverse they&#39;d notice that it begins with purity and innocence, and man&#39;s inaction and injustices create chaos, hopelessness and war. I wanted people to feel tearful and affected and maybe for a second they&#39;d think about doing something to change things. I&#39;m glad people still like it. They tell me it&#39;s on a lot of top ten lists, all time greatest music videos. I&#39;m very proud of it.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: Do you have any thoughts on the media frenzy concerning his personal life?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: You know, Michael was always a tender, sweet guy. He truly believed in the purpose behind &quot;Man in the Mirror.&rdquo;... when I worked with him, he was generous, caring, and spared no expense to do everything the right way.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: It&#39;s quite a big deal to do such a music video with such a worldwide superstar.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: No question. He gave me opportunities that changed my life. The person at his record company, Larry Stessel, also had a lot to do with helping me as well and continued to support me in the music video business until it changed in the 1990s.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: So you worked on other Jackson projects.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: Yes, the first thing I ever did was </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Jacksons Live!</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> in the early 80s. I edited other music videos, biographies, and directed a CBS Special called </span><span class="cs43C038A">Michael Jackson: The Magic Returns</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: Let&#39;s return to &quot;Man in the Mirror.&quot; The video is noted for the footage. How did you get all that compelling material?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: I literally traveled the world getting all that footage together. Some of it was archival. Other sequences, we shot. It was grueling too. I would give a list of shots I was looking for, and they would wheel out stacks of tapes with famine, war, disasters, and other imagery that would leave me shell shocked. It was a gut wrenching task for sure. One of the things we did, and it was a new thing at the time, was to paint color on certain images to emphasis something. For instance, the black and white scene of the Kennedy funeral procession, I had the American flag draping the coffin painted red, white, and blue. I had the bullets being fired from a Vietnam era bomber painted bright red. These things were subtle, but subconsciously it made it watchable and sort of reset the subconscious circuit breaker.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: How did you get the idea to do a video without the star in it? You know, not featuring the star.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: We actually shot a lot of material with Michael, but it didn&#39;t work with all the difficult images we were showing. You can&#39;t really show a mega-star getting out of a limo after you&#39;ve just shown kids starving in Africa. So the lyrics really dictated the content. You know, as I began to edit the piece together, I quickly realized it was way bigger than any one person. Larry Stessel, Michael&#39;s record exec, agreed.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: How involved was Michael in the edit bay?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: He left me alone. He came in once to see a cut, and he was moved to tears. When he finally gained his composure, he looked at me and said, &quot;No changes.&quot; We did have to change two shots because of logos that we could not get clearance for, but no creative changes were ever made from the first version. That&#39;s pretty much unheard of.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: Is it true that he didn&#39;t see the final cut until he was on the stage singing the song live at the Grammys?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: Yes, that is true. They put up a forty foot screen, so he could see the video as he sang. He was stunned by the whole experience. At the end of the song, he collapsed on the stage and had to be helped to his feet. I was stunned too, and I think that is when it all sank in.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: A lot of people are impacted by the video. Some even say they changed their lives after seeing it. What&#39;s your response to that?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: I think &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; is a very important song. I mean, the lyrics are just incredible. I felt a responsibility to do something great. We did realize at the time that we wanted to impact humanity. I&#39;m glad to hear that some say we did.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: Did you ever consider doing a remake?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">DW: We always wanted to do an updated version and were very close to having discussions with Michael, but fate changed all that.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jrsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22was+enthusiastic+about+taking+a+new+look+at+the%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H1iSjc-hTW&amp;sig=ACfU3U28b_9cckZIjtZwHd7nBhC9FBS9Gw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiviLyJorLhAhURbq0KHSu2BjkQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22was%20enthusiastic%20about%20taking%20a%20new%20look%20at%20the%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Jet&quot; magazine (March 21, 1988)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105820/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/anotherjetmag.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived scan of article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bad&#39;s blockbuster message song, &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;, is very special to Jackson. &quot;It was my concept,&quot; he said, &quot;It was in Hong Kong that I called Frank (Dileo, his manager) and told him what I wanted to do. I wanted to show Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, (John F.)
