Not quite the &quot;JACKSON TICKETS CHANGING HANDS AT &pound;500 A TIME&quot; shock horror stories circulating in the more excitable morning newspapers--clearly nobody makes a fast buck out of Michael Jackson!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The merchandisers seem to be faring a little better. The designer jumpers aren&#39;t too popular (at &pound;40 a time, I can&#39;t imagine why!) but there are plenty of takers for the scarves (&pound;6) T-shirts (&pound;10), &quot;official calendars&quot; (&pound;2) and programs--oops, sorry, tour brochures (&pound;5). Cripes, they&#39;re even flogging a few Kim Wilde shirts at a tenner at a time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inside the stadium the atmosphere isn&#39;t as hysterical as you&#39;d imagine on the first night of The Messiah&#39;s residency... a reaction, perhaps, to the gloomy weather; the fact that half the audience is knackered after queueing most of the night for the prime view; and the sight of Gary Davies waffling away on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few knots of people wave banners proclaiming RADIO ONE WELCOMES MICHAEL JACKSON in the hope that Gary Davies will award them a Radio One pen or something., and Pepsi banners flutter everywhere, just to remind you who are the real tour sponsors.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the stroke of 7pm, Gary Davies waffles some more and on prances Kim Wilde to face the biggest audience of her life. She waves a red scarf, but is otherwise decked out in regulation Jackson black and the crowd respond warmly as she yells something totally incomprehensible at them. She jumps about a lot and the audience clap along when asked, even greeting her current single, &quot;You Came&quot; (played foolishly early in the set) with a fair degree of enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She&#39;s on for 30 minutes which is just about right, really. Enough time to whip through the hits (&quot;Kids in America&quot; and &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#39; On&quot; provide a rousing climax); overcome the strange whistles through the sound system that bedevil &quot;Cambodia&quot;; and generally while away, the time waiting for Jackson without unduly taxing our patience or outstaying her welcome. Why, she even gets to bring on her own guest--Junior Giscombe--for a duet. What a trouper!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, the real fun starts. First, we have a few practice screams, then it&#39;s several rounds of the Mexican Wave, and then--most exciting of all--we play spot the celeb. Anybody who looks remotely famous who appears in the VIP seats is roundly cheered... Terence Trent D&#39;Arby, Frank Bruno, Jack Nicholson, and several lavatory attendants get standing ovations. It&#39;s got to be better than listening to Gary Davies!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At last, it&#39;s time. The huge screens at the side of the stage show close-ups of the Jackson boots. Cheers. Smoke billows from the stage. Screeches A blaze of light and five figures stand motionless center-stage. Roars. The screens focus on Michael, his face contorted in an evil sneer. Manic applause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He hasn&#39;t done anything yet and Wembley is going crazy. The band is playing &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#39; Somethin&quot; and the five male figures are dancing and glaring in perfect unison. You peer closely as the main-man peels away. Is it really him? He grabs his crotch. It&#39;s him!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two minutes into the show and his jacket is already off. He twists and twirls in his silver shirt and bondage trousers as swooning girls are being passed to the front of the stage like rag dolls. A firecracker explodes and the shrieks are deafening. Michael shimmies and grabs his crotch. It&#39;s quite an opening.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Backing singer Sheryl Crow joins him for a smooch in the Siedah Garrett role on &quot;I Can&#39;t Stop Loving You&quot; and the clinch that follows is X-certificate stuff. And this is the man who&#39;s meant to be celibate?!?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Blimey, there&#39;s more canoodling as he goes into &quot;She&#39;s Out of My Life&quot;. As Michael wails and sobs... a blonde in a black miniskirt mysteriously climbs on the stage and has a grope with MJ. It&#39;s not so much raunchy as &#39;A&#39; level soft porn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He may have discovered sex, but he&#39;s still shy. For the first hour, his only address to the adoring masses is, &quot;Here&#39;s some of the old songs in the old-fashioned way&quot;, as he chucks in a selection of Jackson 5 classics. He&#39;s moaning and crying again through &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot; and we&#39;re all moaning and crying and swaying with him. But suddenly, with a &nbsp;display of footwork unseen since George Best was here, Jackson is thrusting his grain at us again and, by jove yes, he&#39;s clutching his crutch! It may not be art, but it&#39;s certainly fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Every movement to the front of the stage, every suspicion of a moonwalk, every jerk of the hips, every screen closeup of the Jackson face/feet/crotch is greeted with a valley of shrieks and cheers. When you fork out &pound;17.50 for a concert ticket, you&#39;re pretty determined to enjoy yourself, but Jackson&#39;s certainly earning his corn out there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three sheets drop from the roof of the stage and the lights go off. We&#39;re scared of the dark and yell in fright. But it&#39;s alright, Michael&#39;s silhouette can be seen behind one of the sheets, and it looks as though he might be clutching his crotch! In fact, he re-emerges dressed as a gangster in hamburg hat, dancing in earnest as he belts out &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, mowing down his fellow dancers at the end with a pretend machine gun. As they lay motionless, Michael disappears into a tent that has bafflingly appeared on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Odd shapes can be seen in the tent. What is the boy doing in there? Presently, he re-emerges in a milkman&#39;s jacket. Oh yes, he&#39;s been taking his hat off. Jennifer Batten, all blonde hair, red lipstick, and screeching guitar, is suddenly strutting alongside Michael at the front of the stage, looking like a member of Sigue Sigue Sputnik as they launch ferociously into &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;. It&#39;s the high spot of the concert so far and--oddly--the first time an instrument has been visible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While we&#39;re still recovering from that one, Mikey disappeared inside the tent again. Weird broody music plays as we breathlessly contemplate what he&#39;s changing into this time. His swimming costume, perhaps?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nope, no such luck, but more shadows and shapes and a figure in a hideous mask emerges from the tent. The screams stick in our throats as another monster in a mask swings across from the other side of the stage on a rope. This monster rips off his mask and, of course, it&#39;s Mikey grinning at us, lurching into &quot;Thriller&quot;. Videos were meant to rid the artist of the need to perform live, but Jackson&#39;s thrown the rule book out of the window, not only making the most famous vid of all time with &quot;Thriller&quot;, but here mastering a love performance of the vid as exciting and startling as it originally was on screen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wembley is in uproar. The dancing the blaze of color, the masks, the clutching of the crotch... we&#39;re all exhausted. Michael disappears and in the lull, the band take over with a display of instrumental playing that is as technically brilliant as it is boring. &quot;I bet The Mission couldn&#39;t do this&quot;, says the man from &quot;The Guardian&quot; and he could be right, but after 20 minutes, we&#39;re on our knees pleading for MJ--or even Kim Wilde--to come back and relieve us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Mikey does come back, he really means business. You can tell that because he&#39;s clutching his crotch. In the last 45 minutes, everything gets thrown in. A jacket that lights up in the dark, firecrackers, mime, moonwalks a-go-go, costume changes galore, and all the best hits... &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and &quot;Bad&quot;, each received with increasing rapture. At one point, he climbs on to a rostrum, drags a curtain around himself and explodes before your very eyes. While you&#39;re still contemplating this strange development, he reappears--with another costume change--atop a crane that takes him out over the top of the audience. This man is in another league.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">London loves Michael and Michael loves London. We know this because he tells us. Seven times. When he bows and walks off, there are roars of disapproval, but he returns for two encores--&quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; and an exquisite version of member of the band, says, &quot;I love you&quot; four more times, clutches his crotch and marches off.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We howl for more, but know we won&#39;t get it. We&#39;re all too drained by the music, the emotion, the experience to handle any more and shuffle out in a state of silent euphoria. Jackson has everything--it&#39;s as simple as that. He&#39;s got the songs, the voice, the charisma, the dancing, the theater, the showmanship... everything. He&#39;s got to be the most complete pop performer of all time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I spoke to every one of the other 71,999 people at Wembley afterwards and they all agreed--it was the concert of a lifetime.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">July 16 Concert:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs1620E5A6">Spokesman Review</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Princess Diana met her favorite pop star Saturday, and after their meeting before his third sold-out performance at Wembley Stadium, Michael Jackson pronounced her &ldquo;just wonderful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Minutes before he was due on stage, Jackson met the met Prince and Princess of Wales in the stadium&rsquo;s banquet hall. With concert sponsor Pepsi, Jackson handed over $450000 to the Prince&rsquo;s Trust, a charity for disadvantaged children, and spoke with the royal couple for a few minutes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">&ldquo;How did you learn to dance so well?&rdquo; asked Charles. &ldquo;Could you teach me to dance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Jackson presented Diana with two Bad tour jackets for her child princes, William , 6, and Harry, 3, and asked why they weren&rsquo;t at the concert. In his familiar silver-studded black jacket and trousers, Jackson later said, &ldquo;I was so excited at meeting the royal couple.I&rsquo;m very, very happy that they came to watch me perform.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Diana, wearing a bright golden yellow silk dress with box shoulders, said &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s my favorite pop star, but I&rsquo;m not so sure about my husband.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Inside the stadium, the crowd cheered and whistled as the royal couple appeared. Jackson began the performance by saying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to welcome our royal guests,&rdquo; then shouted, &ldquo;How&rsquo;re ya doin&#39;&rdquo; as he looked over to their box.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Diana seemed to be in heaven as she clapped and swayed to Thriller, Billie Jean and Bad, but Dirty Diana &ndash; now topping the British &ndash; now topping the British charts &ndash; was the song that excited her most and she jumped up and down to the rhythm.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> </span><span class="cs2DE14E7C">Charles, however, shifted uneasily in his seat during the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was so excited at meeting the royal couple,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I am very, very happy that they have come to watch me perform. I thought the princess was just wonderful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Prince Charles, always the quipster, asked Jackson how he learned to dance so well, and joked, &ldquo;Could you teach me to dance?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs7B63FF4E">SPECIAL: PRINCESS DIANA, 1961-1997</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">The couple&rsquo;s July 16 turnout to see Michael Jackson at Wembley Stadium gives some credence to that view. The two laughed and smiled throughout the concert, and Diana was even spotted whispering in Charles&rsquo;s ear during Jackson&rsquo;s rendition of Dirty Diana. At one point the prince actually got to his feet and swayed to the beat &mdash; a remarkable feat for a known rock dud.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bob Jones, publicist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104120/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/blackradio.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Black Radio Exclusive&quot; magazine (July 22, 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs100A9FB">London&mdash;As these notes are being written, I am enroute to London for the first three (July 14, 15 and 16) shows of seven sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium. Another record, but one which confirms the fact that Michael continues to outdraw any act in the history of touring. Michael has attained his unchallenged status as the number one entertainer in the world today, because he walks with kings&mdash;but never loses the common touch&mdash;and sense of caring for his fellow man&mdash;born of his own roots.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs100A9FB">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs100A9FB"><a class="cs3924BAD3" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20jackson&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Jet&rdquo; magazine (August 8, 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs100A9FB">During one of his London dates which made his musical conquest of Europe complete, the Prince and Princess of Wales were in the audience in their Royal Box. The other famous fans who turned out to cheer Jackson included actress Sophia Loren, singer Shirley Bassey, Adam Faith, Jane Seymour and Mick Jagger&rsquo;s daughter, Jade, and her escort Josh Astor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Unknown concert date:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE"><a class="cs104BA6B9" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110953/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/hotpress.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Hot Press&rdquo; magazine (August 11, 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At mid-day, outside Wembley Stadium, 8 hours before Michael was due onstage, 4 hours before the gates were due to open, the place was alive. A circus had come to town and not just any circus: The Greatest Show on Earth and, with it, the revellers, the hawkers, the hangers-on, the thieves riding its coattails looking for rich pickings. At the tube station, loudspeaker announcements greeted every incoming train with the police bulletin that pickpockets abounded and there were 40,000 forged tickets on sale. There were police on motorcycles, horseback, and foot, conspicuously present, but the touts carried on their business with the minimum discretion, bargaining prices from &pound;150 to just over face value depending on the wiliness of the buyer. Business, many complained, was not good: there were too many touts and horror stories of forgeries were keeping prospective customers away. By showtime, the word was you could pick up a ticket for less than its original price.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">People strolled through the crowd waving programs, posters, and t-shirts for sale, all manner of items spotting the magic name, wildly varying in quality and constantly changing in price in direct competition with the nearest hawker. Local newsagents had filled their windows with display copies of &quot;Moonwalk&quot;, pubs were overflowing, chippers packed. Fast-food stands bedecked in Jackson paraphernalia did a roaring trade. All around the huge portals of the stadium there was a buzz in the air, a tangible sense of anticipation. With hours to go, people were turning up simply to be there, to get ready to be a part of something special...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the stadium slowly filled, people milling beneath the conspicuous Pepsi banners, the crowd-mix appeared more and more complete: from middle-aged couples to noisy gangs of young kids, from the super-hip to the ultra-straight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All London life was here, the (always) predominantly white audience being for once set off by a large and visible black presence. The PA played faint old Motown hits, the crowd picnicked, drank, sang snatches from Michael&#39;s hits, practiced mass synchronized arm ripples that would have had Chinese schoolchildren on the floor in fits of derisive giggles, and generally entertained themselves. Still hours before anything could possibly begin, there was a stirring every time something moved onstage, every time the PA went silent, every time a soundman checked something--and though such stirrings may be standard fare for the big rock event, this was palpably something more, this was more than just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to catch the biggest, the best, it was a meeting of the mythic with reality, a chance to see the invisible man, the intangible made flesh. For, of all the living stars of our time, Michael Jackson is the most distant, the most unreal, the most separate from any everyday sense of human reality. Separated by unprecedented success, by phenomenal natural talent, by having reached almost unattainable peaks of skill... This crowd wasn&#39;t just waiting to see Michael Jackson: it was waiting to see if Michael Jackson existed at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To understand that, one has only to witness the reaction to his sudden appearance onstage, distinguishable only as a familiar shape thrown before a bank of spacecraft-like lights rising from the stage. The crowd had been warm to undeserving pop-rock of Kim Wilde, but for Michael, they exploded into noise virtually drowning out the exhilarating opening of &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#39; Somethin&rsquo;&quot;, roaring at the first trademark &quot;hee&quot; to emerge from his lips at the first sight of his white socks on the huge side-stage video screens, at the first flash of his grimacing face... and continuing to roar with approval for every familiar move, costume, grimace, vocal trademark delivered for the next two hours, before, after, and throughout a succession of some of the most famous songs in the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Each roar was more than a sign of approval, it was an affirmation... the crowd was present and so was Michael. This is the love contact between audience and star, virtually the only real reason left for a concert of this size, certainly more important than the music, and by his very appearance on stage, Michael Jackson could not put a foot wrong with the Wembley crowd.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not that Michael would put a foot wrong. Michael understands about feet, and more particularly &nbsp;about ankles. His absurd trousers have always been pitched a few inches high, and not just to show off his clean white socks: the elasticity of his ankle movements is a central focus of his dancing, whether moonwalking with a soft-shoe ease or bringing everything to a halt as he perches static for long seconds on his tiptoes, body bent at improbable angles. Jackson has total body precision, and he likes to show it. He does more than make those fluidly unreal motions look easy, he makes them look painful, he makes them look like no other creature on earth can do it quite like him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And from start to finish, he is in motion, non-stop dancing. His four agile stud dancers, play his foils, and never get the opportunity to show him up. In exactly choreographed routines, Michael remains at the center of attention not simply because he dances superbly, but because he dances like Michael Jackson. The repertoire of moves is familiar (and over two hours unsurprisingly repetitive); those ankle twists, arm punches, groin grabs. Every trademark move is rapturously received not despite but because we&#39;ve seen them all before, many, many times, though never in the flesh...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson live is an all-singing and dancing video pastiche. There is something ludicrous about how closely each hit song performance emulates its famous video: for &quot;Thriller&quot;, you get a werewolf mask and zombie shuffle; for &quot;Beat It&quot;, the West Side Story warfare; for &quot;Bad&quot;, the limb-snapping, groin-snatching subway gang ensemble; for &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, the girl-grabbing harassment. It&#39;s all here, everything you&#39;ve seen on your TV sets, and it&#39;s live...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...But is it alive? The playing and arrangements are seamless, but in no way spontaneous. There is no room for improvisation here, no margin for error. There are awesome explosions, spectacular costume changes, baffling magic effects--the music provides a backdrop to this, everything in its place. And thought the unique talents of Jackson the singer and performer are left in no doubt... his humanity, his reality, remains unconfirmed. He robot-dances through &quot;Human Nature&quot; without even a hint of irony...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Only during the final soulful encore of &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; does he appear to loosen up, falling to his knees, begging and imploring, and though you know it&#39;s only another part of the act, the junior James Brown show, you believe in it, like the finest drama, because it gives you something to believe in. Michael temporarily stripped of Hollywood razzamatazz and glitz, his ethereal voice breaking. And what a voice! Michael Jackson live is a SHOW, a production from beginning to end, spectacular rather than involving, but just close your eyes for a second and the voice at the center makes it all worthwhile. As Sinatra was The Voice for his time, so Michael is The Voice for ours, the most imitated and yet, as he confirms live, the most unique.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Final impressions: 75,000 people were entertained as 75,000 people rarely can be, yet, even after two hours in his living presence, they roared approval for the huge &quot;Bad&quot; cover photos that were displayed on video immediately post-gig. The unreal image still held the same potency. At one point in his set, Michael embraced a girl plucked from the crowd by his burly minders, dancing with her during the final bars of &quot;She&#39;s Out of My Life&quot;. Springsteen and Bono employ the same audience-embracing device, yet with them it is almost always funny, warming, exciting: the audience&#39;s desire for contact expressed in the joy and delight of the lucky guest. Embracing Jackson, the girl from the crowd displayed something closer to shock, staring bug-eyed and open-mouthed at the star, not unable to believe her luck, but hardly able to believe he was real.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Bambigoye was present at Wembley on the opening night and finally got his quotes, proof that Michael can and does talk when he wants to. &quot;I love you London&quot;, he said. Several times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ob0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20jackson&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Jet&rdquo; magazine (August 8, 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Music&#39;s megastar Michael Jackson once told JET in an interview that he doesn&rsquo;t like to follow in anyone&rsquo;s footsteps because he prefers to blaze trails.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In London recently, he blazed new attendance trails when he became the first artist to ever perform five concert dates before a capacity 72,000 crowd (each date) in the city&rsquo;s Wembley Stadium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Scores of youngsters fainted in the crush to get a better view,&rdquo; reports The Sun, a London tabloid newspaper. &ldquo;During a slow number, Jackson plucked a leggy blonde from the audience and put her on stage&mdash;where the singer planted a kiss on her cheek,&rdquo; the newspaper said. Although this unexpected contact with a fan in the audience only happened once, it established a heart-throbbing experience that lingered with the crowd as he sang, danced and pranced for nearly two hours performing 16 of his best-selling songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The hits, some of which he composed, were taken from his albums, Off The Wall, Thriller and his current best-seller, Bad. The 29-year-old singer/songwriter/ dancer and variety performer, who is listed in The Guinness Book of World Records as the No. 1 recording artist in the world, was greeted with cheers and screams of ecstasy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although most of the audience at the concerts were made up of European Whites, there were a sprinkling of British Blacks, Arabs and Asians. The London leg of his European tour had special meaning for the Blacks in Britain who have been fans of Jackson ever since he first appeared there as a featured singer with The Jackson Five. He was then singing with his brothers&mdash;Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...As one of the world&rsquo;s biggest recording artists, Jackson is also one of the richest. He set a record during the London dates by earning $700,000 an hour while on stage, according to the London Daily Express. Altogether, the sensational singer grossed $12 million from his British visit. The newspaper said he gave $300,000 to charities in Britain to be divided between the Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, the Prince&rsquo;s Trust and Children In Need.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unlike some foreign entertainers, Jackson added the British revenue to his conquest. According to the London Daily Mail, Jackson arrived in London with a piece of paper called Inland Revenue FEU 4 and it&rsquo;s worth about $3 million. The Daily Mail said: &ldquo;That is the sum the British taxman would have taken from him had it not been for the FEU4--a &#39;payer&rsquo;s notification that basic rate withholding tax is not appropriate,&#39; as the taxmen put it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In plain language, it means that about two months ago, Jackson&rsquo;s tax team of top accountants contacted a small office in Birmingham (England) and came clean not only on the $12 million he expects to earn from his shows here, but also every penny he expects to have to spend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During his London visit, Jackson took time out to drop in to see Paul Russell, who heads CBS Records there.</span></p></body>
