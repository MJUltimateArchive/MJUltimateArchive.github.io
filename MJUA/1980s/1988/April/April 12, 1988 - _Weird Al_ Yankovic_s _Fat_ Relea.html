On the cover, Yankovic wears a multizippered and buckled outfit. &quot;Fat,&quot; sung to the tune of Jackson&#39;s &quot;Bad,&quot; has already been a hit and the video has been convulsing viewers. Two of Yankovic&#39;s role models, Spike Jones and Allan Sherman, sometimes recorded music they wanted to be taken seriously. But Yankovic feels no such yearning. &quot;Even Worse,&quot; his fifth LP, is about half parodies and half originals; he wrote both words and music. He&#39;d like to have a hit with an original. Yankovic says, &#39;&quot;For One More Minute&#39; is my all-time favorite song that I wrote. It&#39;s a sick Elvis Presley doo wop love ballad with bitter, twisted lyrics. I had Christmas at Ground Zero,&#39; a cheery Christmas tune about the end of the world.&quot; For albums, Yankovic writes the parodies after the originals, so the parodies will be topical.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The biggest sellers of his dozen singles were &quot;Fat&quot; and &quot;Eat It,&quot; from Jackson&#39;s &quot;Beat It.&quot; Yankovic says, &quot;I seem to be having very good luck with Michael. People who are fun to do parodies of have a strong visual image; there&#39;s something to do takeoffs on. Michael Jackson is a perfect example. I&#39;ll do a parody of him every five years like clockwork.&quot; Yankovic assumes that Jackson enjoys his parodies. He says, &quot;The parodies have to have the approval of the writers of the music. Michael has been terrific. &quot;He doesn&#39;t have to let me do this kind of stuff. He doesn&#39;t need the additional royalties. The only reason he would let me is that he has a sense of humor. It is heartening to find somebody that popular, talented and powerful who can really take a joke.&quot; When Yankovic first heard &quot;Bad,&quot; he thought of &quot;Fat.&quot; He says, &quot;I could use every fat joke ever written. I immediately saw the video potential. But people got mad at Randy Newman&#39;s &#39;Short People&#39; and it wasn&#39;t even about short people. I thought long and hard about it. &quot;I decided to do &#39;Fat&#39; after all. I&#39;d still use all the corny fat jokes and not make it derogatory. We made the protagonist so huge that not many people would be able to identify with him. The guy is proud of his obesity; it&#39;s more of a macho statement. We haven&#39;t had any negative reaction. &quot;Most negative letters I get are &#39;How could you do that to Michael Jackson?&#39; They don&#39;t realize if he didn&#39;t like it, I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.&quot; For the video, Yankovic put an ad in Variety for fat dancers. About three dozen people showed up to audition. We picked our six favorites. One was a guy delivering a pizza to the casting office. I said, &#39;You&#39;d be perfect.&#39; He&#39;s in it. &quot;They really had a workout. The last scene was running up stairs. They had to do that shot 15 times. I was in a huge costume with a makeup job that took 3V4 hours each morning. They glued rubber pieces to my face to make it look fat. Every time I&#39;d look in the mirror I&#39;d scare myself.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/michael-jackson-remembered-weird-al-yankovic-on-imitation-as-flattery-96288/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rolling Stone&rdquo; (July 9, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180817052507/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/michael-jackson-remembered-weird-al-yankovic-on-imitation-as-flattery-96288/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first time I actually ran into [Michael Jackson] was backstage at one of his concerts, this was maybe four years later, when </span><span class="cs43C038A">Even Worse</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> came out with my second parody, &ldquo;Fat.&rdquo; I went backstage, and he was seeing a lot of people, but I brought along a gold record of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Even Worse</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> to present to him, and he was very gracious and thanked me for it and said some nice things.
