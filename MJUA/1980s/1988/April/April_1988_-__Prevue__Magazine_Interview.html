He&#39;s bad! In fact, he&#39;s more than bad, he&#39;s a 5&#39;10&quot; dynamo whose previous album skyrocketed to a record-breaking 38 million in sales. He&#39;s the baddest of the bad, with a battery of rock videos assaulting our pop senses like Pepsi after peanuts. After a four-year Pepsi after peanuts. After a four-year silence (except for an eyeful of TV commercials and a short science-fantasy fx thriller), the 29-year-old teen idol has launched a new album into the musical galaxy, and followed-up with a world tour that has ignited Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the USA. Pausing for a heartbeat in his schedule, the elusive performer gave an exclusive interview to &quot;Prevue&quot; on his once and future plans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: There was conjecture after the 1984 Victory tour with your brothers that you wouldn&#39;t perform in public again. And here you are, soloing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I&#39;d been off the stage for years and wanted to perform again. It&#39;s been in the planning stages for a long time; all carefully worked out to my specifications.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Does that indicate you&#39;re less introverted this time around?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I will always be shy, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. Being soft-spoken or secure within oneself is a virtue--especially in Japan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: You&#39;re preparing to appear in another feature film. [Jackson was in 1978&#39;s &quot;The Wiz&quot;.] Have you discussed it with Francis Coppola, who helmed Captain EO, or Steven Spielberg, who considered you for this &quot;Peter Pan&quot; project?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: It&#39;s too soon to discuss that yet. I don&#39;t want to be mysterious, but, it&#39;s business, so I can&#39;t say, except to tell you it will have a message of peace.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Are you satisfied with &quot;Captain EO&quot;, and how it&#39;s been handled in Disney parks?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes; we all worked on it very hard. I like the special effects and the message behind the film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: It&#39;s been reported that the 18-minute adventure hasn&#39;t opened in Tokyo&#39;s Disneyland because you&#39;re asking too much for the screening rights.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I don&#39;t know anything about that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Another Disneyland is due to be built near Paris, where your friend Diana Ross has bought a home. There have been rumors you&#39;ve considered doing the same.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Both would be good reasons to live there, but I have no plans to move to France.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Ross discovered the Jacksons when you were only ten. Are you still close?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Yes, *very* close. When we don&#39;t see each other, we talk on the phone. She&#39;s in Connecticut with her Norwegian husband, Arne Naes and their baby son, a lot of the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: There&#39;s an expectation that the two of you will record together again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I&#39;ve written songs for Diana, but we haven&#39;t been able to sing together for some time. We sing *in spirit*; we&#39;re always together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: You have moved away from the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, though, even though you were extremely involved with them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: That&#39;s entirely a personal matter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: As an arch-conservative group, they were allegedly disenchanted with your image. Was your departure voluntary?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I think the future illuminates our steps for ourselves and for others, but I&#39;d rather not discuss my spiritual beliefs now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: It&#39;s been said you believe that instead of writing your songs, you pluck them for the universal consciousness, which some call God. Is your music inspired by God?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: It can be interpreted that way, but I don&#39;t want to elaborate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: While we&#39;re on the subject of music, how do you respond to the observation that your sister&#39;s moves are similar to yours?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I think there is a Jackson *style*, and that Janet is finally doing what she always wanted to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: How do you feel about the observation that she&#39;s more boyish--or tom-boyish--than her brother?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Janet is always her own person, and, like the rest of the family, very talented. But, everything is up to the public--they choose who they&#39;re interested in most and what they like about them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Are there any other close female friends in your private life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I like to think *everyone* I know is a friend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: You&#39;ve become friends with Liz Taylor, socializing in Hollywood and your Encino home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Miss Taylor is a very smart lady, filled with a sense of joy and wonder.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: She&#39;s campaigned heavily against AIDS; have you considered reinforcing her efforts?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: It&#39;s one of the pressing issues of our time, and deserves everyone&#39;s support.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Both morally and financially. Is it bothersome when the media speculates your worth could top $1 billion?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very interesting. They write all kinds of things, but that isn&#39;t the worst. I don&#39;t read most of it, though. If a writer or reviewer has a genuine desire to communicate to the consuming public, that&#39;s all right, but I don&#39;t want to interpret what motivates negative reviewers. But, why dwell on it? I concentrate on my work, giving pleasure to others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Your popularity goes well beyond that. For example, you&#39;ve almost made androgyny respectable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Well, everyone is entitled to be their own unique, individual self.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PREVUE: Then, as a very individualistic superstar, what do you want most for the future?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JACKSON: Peace and health for everyone--*that&#39;s* the ultimate!</span></p></body>
