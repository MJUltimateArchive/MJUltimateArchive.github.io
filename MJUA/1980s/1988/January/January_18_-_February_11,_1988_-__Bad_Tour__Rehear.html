I found a somewhat different person in Pensacola. He was absolutely charming, very polite&hellip; It&rsquo;s a pretty awesome experience to watch him rehearse. He knows exactly what he wants and how to get it. For the first time, Michael is making all the decisions. He&rsquo;s very much in charge.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;TV Squad&rdquo; (May 20, 2011) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110523052725/http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/05/20/mary-hart-interview-leaving-entertainment-tonight/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;TV Squad&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I know it&#39;s hard to pick, but do you have a favorite interview of all time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mary Hart</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It&#39;s so tough! I mean, it comes down to the same handful of interviews, but I have to say my time with Michael Jackson was so special, it was so unique, because nobody got that time. Yes, Oprah did that sit-down interview at Neverland Ranch with him, but you know what? Years before that, I had been in Pensacola, Florida with Michael, watching him rehearse for his Bad Tour. I was there with him on stage for two days, watching him be the masterful leader of every move, every note, every intonation of what he did, and it was remarkable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And then when I was with him in Kansas City and walked him out on the stage, he held my hand through the tunnel, right out to the edge of the stage, then let go and transformed himself from this shy person that he was into this magnificent genius performer. It was the most remarkable thing I&#39;d ever seen. It really was mind-blowing.</span></p></body>
