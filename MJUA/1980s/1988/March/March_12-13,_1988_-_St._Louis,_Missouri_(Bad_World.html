Carol is here in court with Mandy, her daughter. Counselor?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Carol, you&rsquo;re Mandy&rsquo;s mother, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Carol Nilwicki (Saint Louis, Missouri): Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Let me cast your mind back to six years ago, Saint Louis, a very cold day. Do you remember?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: I remember.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Twenty two degrees below zero. What were doing on that day?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: I was standing in line waiting to get Michael Jackson tickets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: And did you get any tickets?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Okay. Now, let&rsquo;s leave you right there and could we have Mandy come up? &lsquo;Cause she comes into this story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rivera: Okay. Mandy Porter. Many, Carol&rsquo;s teenage daughter is a young lady who suffers from a disease &ndash; don&rsquo;t know the Latin name &ndash; but the net effect is that Mandy is losing her vision, I believe, in both eyes. It was a condition that Michael Jackson was made aware of. Counselor?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Carol, so you couldn&rsquo;t get the tickets. What happened after that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: I came home and she was standing at the top of the stairs all excited. &ldquo;Did you get my tickets?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: And I was like, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Well, if Michael found out about this, he&rsquo;d be really upset.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: What &ndash; what did she do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: I have a friend that was at the house at the time, and he made a video recording. Three days went by. I went ahead and went to church that evening. And came back home to find her standing at the top of the stairs going, &ldquo;My friend Mikey called.&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s nice, honey.&rdquo; And my husband was standing there. He said, &ldquo;Michael Jackson was calling, leaving a message for us &ndash; for Amanda on the answering machine.&rdquo; And they got to be friends. They started talking on the phone. He talked to my husband and myself to gain permission.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: He asked your permission whether to talk to your daughter?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Michael is always respectful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Your daughter has some medical problems. Did Michael ever help out?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Yes, Michael&rsquo;s helped out with her medical bills.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Okay. She&rsquo;s still friendly with Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Oh, yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Before ask her a couple of questions, you have a little boy, too, don&rsquo;t you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Yes, I do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: How old is that boy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Seven.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Would you have any problem about letting Michael take care of that boy or go out with that boy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: I would trust Michael Jackson with my son&rsquo;s life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Okay. Thank you. Mandy, can I ask you&hellip; (applause) Many, you&rsquo;ve known Michael a long time now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter (friend of Michael Jackson): Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: What sorts of things do you do with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Well, basically, anything else that anybody else would do with their child or their friends. As teenagers go out, and they like to go out shopping and looking around. That&rsquo;s what me and Michael like to do. We like to talk about &ndash; and catch up on things that we haven&rsquo;t caught up with from the previous time that we talked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Did he ever do anything that upset you or&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: &hellip; we&rsquo;ll say was improper? Never, never, never?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Never.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Felder: Okay, I have no further questions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hon. Becker: Ms. Walden, do you wish to inquire?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Please. It&rsquo;s Mrs. Porter?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Nilwicki. Mrs. Nilwicki.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Nilwicki, I&rsquo;m sorry. Mrs. Nilwicki, how old is your daughter?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: She will be seventeen in December.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:And she&rsquo;s known Michael Jackson how long?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Since she was about eleven.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Eleven. Would you, by any chance, know how old Mr Jackson is?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m well aware of his age.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Would you tell the jury and the audience?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:He&rsquo;s thirty five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Now if this was any other thirty five year old man, would you let your daughter go off with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:You must realize something. We sought Michael Jackson out. He did not seek my daughter out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: You have a seventeen year old daughter, Mrs. Nilwicki. If another thirty five year old man approached you and said he wanted a friendship with your daughter, would you allow it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:The situation would depend. I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Elaborate for us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: We have family friends. You have to understanding. You&rsquo;re talking about going out. Are you talking about going out in a dating situation?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:I&rsquo;m talking about any thirty five year old man taking your seventeen year old daughter anywhere?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mrs Nilwicki: Well, that leaves a lot of room for speculation. It really does.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Amanda?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:You an Michael Jackson are still very good friends?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Yes, we are.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:He&rsquo;s a special friend?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Yes, he is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:You love him very much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Yes, I do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:You consider yourself lucky and privileged to have him as a friend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:You would do nothing or say anything that would harm or hinder or perhaps sever that friendship, would you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: If it was the truth, yes, I would.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Walden:Do you have any other thirty five year old male friends?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. Mandy Porter: Yes, I do.
