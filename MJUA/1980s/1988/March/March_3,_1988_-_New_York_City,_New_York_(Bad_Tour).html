She told JET: &quot;I thought he was wonderful, but I&#39;m a huge fan of his. I saw his opening night concert at the (Madison Square) Garden, and it&#39;s the best rock concert I ever saw. He&#39;s got everything. He&#39;s got style, he&#39;s got grace, he&#39;s got great stuff. He combines the best of the old&mdash;the (Fred) Astaire, the (Gene) Kelly&mdash;that kind of thing with terrific music... Michael has more energy than anybody. He even tired me out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Voicing similar views, Mary Hart, who hosts the CBS-TV &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; show, said: &quot;Michael Jackson is a talented entertainer. He is a shy young man, but he is the greatest performer on the scene today.&quot; She said he was being treated unfairly by some segments of the media that bashed his Bad album, his performances and called him &quot;the most unwelcomed comeback&quot; this year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110522/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article8.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; magazine (May 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The measure of Michael Jackson&#39;s commitment to finesse is Tatiana Y. Thumbtzen. She is being paid, presumably handsomely, to stride on stage during his second encore number &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, walk from one side to the other and walk off again. The whole thing is over in approximately 15 seconds.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It doesn&#39;t take much skill. All you need is a heart-stopping figure and one of those tubular short dresses purveyed by Azzedine Alaia. Thus you simply strut your remarkable stuff in front of Michael Jackson, he affects uncappable sexual frenzy and you clock off stage left.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the context of the show that Jackson is currently taking around America and brings to Europe in June. Tatiana Y. Thumbtzen&#39;s profligate work rate is about par. She appeared in &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; promo and as much as anything else, this performance is about making flesh the fantastical world of video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although much altered since its opening in Tokyo last July, each song cleaves closely to its video version. Thriller has the four dancers--who echo Jackson&#39;s every movement throughout--dressed up as ghouls. &quot;Beat It&quot; has them as gangsters. &quot;Bad&quot; has him in the exact album sleeve outfit while there mere sight of his silhoutted profile and That Trilby is as good as a written announcement that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; is imminent. (In fact, the enormous screen that dangles above the stage and [illegible]-nuances to those of the 20,000 crowd too far [illegible] to see adopts the televisual principle of running some song titles as captions.) Whatever else [illegible] the Michael Jackson show 1988 represents triumph of strong branding.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The performer with the lightest load after Tatiana Thumbtzen&#39;s is Billy Idol&#39;s guitarist, Steve Stevens, who is catapulted on stage to contribute a [illegible]-loosening solo to &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; and then dispatches with thanks. The foremost musical revelation is [illegible] neatly a musician of Stevens&#39; sort fits into Jackson sound as rendered live. The seven-piece band (drums, bass, two guitars, and keyboards) don&#39;t strive over-hard to emulate slippery syncopation of recent Jackson albums, much of which was presumably painstakingly synthesized--and instead purvey a flinty, straight-hard rock which hits the chest rather than the [illegible]. This is not a particularly great dance band, which is odd when you consider who the singer is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110104/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/article10.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Right On!&rdquo; magazine (July 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael Jackson started preparing for his solo concert tour, which is now in full swing (currently he&rsquo;s in Europe), many of his loyal fans wondered whether or not the excitement he generated through the infamous Victory Tour could be duplicated. The baddest performer in the land can safely say that he went beyond the extra mile and took his performance to new heights.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For those who were fortunate enough to get tickets (and that doesn&#39;t seem to be very many of his loyal fans), Michael Jackson&rsquo;s concert is the best they&rsquo;ve ever attended. There&rsquo;s no question; Michael can now take James Brown&#39;s place for the title of &ldquo;the hardest working man in show business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From the very moment you enter the concert hall where Michael&rsquo;s show takes place, it&rsquo;s more than evident that this is a first-class production. Alongside the stage, several computers ond the latest musical equipment can be found. No expense was spared to make sure that the quality of the sound and visuals were up to par. Even though many of Michael&rsquo;s fans had seats in the balcony, he had large screens strategically placed so that his bigger-than-life image could appear before his fans&rsquo; eyes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although many fans were dismayed that the old familiar Jackson Five numbers were squeezed into a short medley, the more current songs like &ldquo;Smooth Criminal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bad&quot;, and &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;, were drawn out to a satisfying length.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In talking to fans, it was difficult to decide what they liked better&mdash;Michael&rsquo;s singing or dancing. Both were superb. Michael, who always does his own choreography, must have taken a cue from the Soul Train dancers. His smoothly executed moves across the stage reminded me of melting butter gliding across a plate. Truly, Michael&rsquo;s gift for dancing is unrivaled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the more enjoyable elements of the show was Michael&rsquo;s use of magic to enhance many of his popular numbers, including several of the tunes from Thriller. We don&rsquo;t want to reveal what he did (we know a lot of you haven&#39;t seen the show yet), but it was so, amazing, we&#39;d like to see it again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 90-minute concert included a variety of costume changes. And, yes, &quot;Thriller&quot; was included. Michael, in monster garb, cavorted across the stage just as he did in the video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Among the ticket holders who literally hung on the edges of their seats were Michael&rsquo;s three sisters, Rebbie, Janet, and LaToya; his parents, Joseph and Katherine Jackson; video star Tatiana; Brooke Shields; Emmanuel Lewis; Sean Lennon, and too many others to mention. But all agreed on one point: it was the greatest show on earth.</span></p></body>
