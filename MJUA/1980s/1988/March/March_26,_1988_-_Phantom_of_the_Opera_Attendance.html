He was clearly interested in the piece. He saw it several times and used to come backstage, often without the entourage that followed him around in later life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The story got to him. I think he had a connection with the lonely, tortured musician. He found the idea of somebody working through music and having a girl as a muse very intriguing &ndash; and he loved that there was illusion in the show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael became interested in playing The Phantom himself, in a movie version of the show. We talked about it a lot, but we&#39;d only just opened and, at the time, I felt that it was too early for it to become a film. I felt his interest in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Phantom</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was because he was interested in doing something theatrical himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was a highly theatrical animal. I remember him saying to me that he&#39;d seen </span><span class="cs43C038A">Cats</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and how happy he was that dance was making a comeback in the theatre. He certainly talked about theatre a lot, and when he was last in London, he went to see </span><span class="cs43C038A">Oliver!</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Of course, he was a great showman himself, but he found the whole stagecraft of musicals extraordinary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/andrew-lloyd-webber-on-phantom-evita-michael-jackson-w517518"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (March 6, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rolling Stone: On the subject of big stars, there&#39;s a picture of Michael Jackson backstage at </span><span class="cs43C038A">Starlight Express</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> in the book, but there&#39;s no story about it. Did you meet him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Webber: Yes. My book finishes with the opening of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Phantom of the Opera</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, but Michael was very keen to be involved in a movie version of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Phantom of the Opera</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. At the time, the show had just gone to Broadway, and he must have seen it three or four times at least. I was with him a couple of times. But we weren&#39;t ready to do a movie at that time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RS: Did he want to be the Phantom?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Webber: Oh, yes. It would have been incredible, but we weren&#39;t ready. </span><span class="cs43C038A">Phantom</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was only in its first year on Broadway.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But I knew him a little bit later, because he shared my love of A.R. Rahman&#39;s music, and we found ourselves some very obscure part of Long Island listening to a Bollywood concert where A.R. was playing. He had a great love of that music. So I knew him a little bit, but I never saw him again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael had gone to see Phantom Of The Opera several times on Broadway. He spent a lot of time backstage, notably without his bodyguards, chatting to Lloyd Webber and the show&rsquo;s star Michael Crawford. Michael felt he could identify with the character and thought it would have been the perfect vehicle to launch him on the big screen, having previously been well received by the critics in The Wiz.</span></p></body>
