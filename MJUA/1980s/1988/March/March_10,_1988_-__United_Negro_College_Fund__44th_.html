Ninety-seven scholarships have been awarded.&rdquo; Edley said the $600,000 will be added to the Jackson fund. &ldquo;It&#39;s a tremendous total contribution by him to Black higher education, and a recognition on his part that the young Black people who are his fans deserve every break in life,&rdquo; says Edley. He added that Jackson&#39;s scholars are enrolled in virtually all of the 42 UNCF schools.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the UNCF tribute dinner at New York&#39;s Sheraton Centre, attended by presidents of the member institutions along with corporation chief executives and superstars of the entertainment industry, two Michael Jackson Scholarship recipients presented to him a book of thank-you letters from all of the students enrolled at Black colleges on his scholarships. Curressia McFarland, a Rust College (Miss.) communications major with a 3.9 average, said: &ldquo;Mr. Jackson, for many years I have followed your singing career, certain that I would grow up and one day marry you. At the same time, I had dreams of a career in broadcasting ... Over the years, I&#39;ve somewhat outgrown the first dream. However, with your help I am a step closer to the second. Thanks to you and the United Negro College Fund, I&#39;ve gained the educational foundation that I needed to attain my career goals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ellis Staten, a music education major at South Carolina&rsquo;s Benedict College, told Jackson: &ldquo;For me, this scholarship has done more than fulfill a financial need; it has helped me to build my confidence and self-esteem...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An honorary doctor of humane letters degree was presented to Jackson by President Henry Ponder of Fisk University, whose rebound from a 1986 financial crisis was helped by a $1.3 million contribution from Bill Cosby and his wife Camille and some of the money raised by Lou Rawls&rsquo; annual telethon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;As though your special gift and talent were not sufficient, you have sought to make the world a better place through many humanitarian and philanthropic efforts with We Are The World, a song you co-wrote with Lionel Richie,&rdquo; Dr. Ponder praised Jackson, adding, &ldquo;You touched the hearts of hundreds of millions of people and spurred international efforts to eradicate world hunger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In presenting him the coveted Frederick D. Patterson Award, named for the former Tuskegee Institute (now University) president who founded the UNCF in 1944, Dr. Mabel McLean, president of Barber Scotia College in Concord, N.C., and then chair of the presidents of UNCF member institutions, told Jackson: &ldquo;Through your efforts to increase knowledge, to combat hunger, to aid terminally ill children, to inspire youth, you have shown the world that caring, sharing and daring to lend a hand is what&#39;s really Bad!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A surprise of the evening came when emcee Ossie Davis, a Howard University alumnus, presented President Ronald Reagan in a pre-recorded message. Congratulating the honoree for receiving the coveted Patterson Award and for becoming &ldquo;the new Dr. J,&rdquo; President Reagan said: &ldquo;I am specially impressed by your involvement with the T.J. Martel Foundation, Camp Good Times for children fighting cancer, and the United Negro College Fund, a charity Nancy and I have been personally committed to for many years ... As honorary chairman of the UNCF soon-to-be announced Capital Campaign, I believe the educational opportunities historically Black colleges and universities offer are vital to the progress of our nation. . . Michael, your partnership with the UNCF will help accomplish more good in the world ... God bless you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The sensitive, shy performing artist was so awed by the accolades that he was almost speechless. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&#39;m a little nervous, but I really am embarrassed,&rdquo; Jackson responded to the tributes. &ldquo;I appreciate everybody coming ... First, I do want to thank God, who makes everything possible. Then my dear mother and father who are in the audience, thank you for all you have done for me. I really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.&rdquo; He had special praise for the UNCF: &ldquo;I would like to say this about the United Negro College Fund. An education opens a person&rsquo;s mind to the entire world, and there is nothing more important than to make sure everyone has the opportunity for an education. To want to learn, to have the capacity to learn and not to be able to is a tragedy. I am honored to be associated with an evening that says this will never happen. Thank you.

Patterson, Dr. Mable P. McLean, president of Barber-Scotia College, said, &quot;Michael, you have God-given talent. And if a person is to make a difference in the world, he must preserve that talent, develop it and use it for the good of others.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She continued, &quot;And because of your musical talent, you have served generations of persons all across the world and for that history has preserved a page for you in its annals. And then for your humanitarian acts, for caring what happens to people, caring enough to do your very best, I assure you that immortality will cradle you gently in its arms and you will be forever safe.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hosted by actor Ossie Davis, the gala affair was attended by many celebrities, including Liza Minnelli, Elizabeth Taylor and Quincy Jones, who paid tribute to him; and filmmaker Spike Lee, Ashford and Simpson. Whitney Houston sang the Black national anthem, Lift Ev&#39;ry Voice and Sing, and America The Beautiful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fisk University capped the tribute by bestowing upon Jackson an honorary doctor of humane letters during the evening. Fisk President Dr. Henry Ponder noted Jackson&#39;s &quot;diligence, determination and discipline&quot; as well as &quot;many humanitarian and philanthropic efforts&quot; in presenting the pop music idol with the honorary degree.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On receiving the honors, Jackson thanked his family and friends in attendance and stressed his commitment to UNCF. &quot;...An education opens a person&#39;s mind to the entire world. And there is nothing more important than to make sure everyone has the opportunity for an education,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson concluded his remarks with, &quot;To want to learn, to have the capacity to learn and not be able to is a tragedy. I am honored to be associated with an evening that says this will never happen. Thank you, I love you all.&quot; Two of the 97 students who have received Michael Jackson Scholarships over the last four years were also on hand to personally thank the performer. Ellis Staten said the scholarship made it possible for him to pursue a bachelor&#39;s degree in music education at Benedict College. Curres-sia McFarland, another scholarship recipient who is a senior at Rust College, said as a youngster she always had dreams of marrying Michael Jackson and a career in broadcasting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Over the years I&#39;ve somewhat outgrown the first dream,&quot; she said, &quot;however, with your help, I am one step closer to the second. Thanks to you and the United Negro College Fund, I&#39;ve gained the educational foundation that I needed in order to obtain my career goals. Thanks to you, I am proof that something good can come out of the South and especially out of Southern Black colleges.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms. McFarland, who will receive a degree in mass communications in the spring with a 3.9 grade average, concluded, &quot;With-out you, Michael Jackson, I may not have had the opportunity to develop into the person that I am.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is also giving other Blacks the opportunity to advance professionally. Former security chief Bill Bray was recently elevated to executive director of MJJ Productions and longtime Motown publicist Bob Jones was named vice president of communications for Jackson&#39;s company. Veteran publicist Mike Mitchell was named by Jackson to handle publicity for the Bad tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Furthermore, Jackson also gave nine Black promoters the chance of a lifetime. Promoter Clarence Avant is co-promoter of the national tour. He told JET, &quot;In all fairness to Michael, he made it very clear that I should do what I wanted to do and involve other Black promoters and I did just that.&quot; He said proudly, &quot;In every single city, there&#39;s a Black guy involved.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not content to just pay lip service to Blacks who want a piece of the action in the multi-billion dollar entertainment industry, Jackson is determined to see that Blacks get more than just the crumbs of the pie. As he sings in one of his songs, &quot;...I&#39;m starting with the man in the mirror, I&#39;m asking him to change his ways. No message could be any clearer, if you want to make the world a better place take a look at yourself and make a change.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ronald Reagan, pre-recorded tape, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=kbsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Michael,+I%E2%80%99m+sorry+that+Nancy+and+I+could+not+be+with+you+for+this+very+special+day,+but+I+want+to+congratulate+you+for+the+honors+you+are+receiving+tonight+from+the+United+Negro+College+Fund+and+the+honorary+degree&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wRzWQdOgme&amp;sig=wOxyBbJ8trlayypbEATayZSm4Yg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ6-Tv47jUAhVBID4KHb5VBIYQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20sorry%20that%20Nancy%20and%20I%20could%20not%20be%20with%20you%20for%20this%20very%20special%20day%2C%20but%20I%20want%20to%20congratulate%20you%20for%20the%20honors%20you%20are%20receiving%20tonight%20from%20the%20United%20Negro%20College%20Fund%20and%20the%20honorary%20degree&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">Jet Magazine</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, I&rsquo;m sorry that Nancy and I could not be with you for this very special day, but I want to congratulate you for the honors you are receiving tonight front the United Negro College Fund and the honorary degree awarded you by Fisk University.
