		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Berlin Zoo Visit</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date assessed by the fact that Michael performed in Berlin on June 19, 1988 and, according to &ldquo;News of the World&rdquo; newspaper, the zoo visit was on &ldquo;Saturday&rdquo;, [June 18, 1988]</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808121658/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/sunday.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;News of the World&rdquo; newspaper (August 28, 1988)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael Jackson wants to go walkabout down at the zoo, it means major surgery of a more unusual kind has to he carried out on his face. For the chimp loving star, trapped in high-security hotels during his glittering European tour, has to have a &quot;facejob&quot; from a master of disguise if he is to get out and see his favorite tree-dwelling pals. With the aid of false teeth, bushy sideburns, a baseball cap, and a pair of oversize sunglasses, showman Michael ventures forth looking like a buck-toothed heavy - and hoping that none of his fans will cotton on to the man hiding behind the elaborate disguise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For nothing pains poor Michael more than being trapped by his own fame. He has every luxury money can buy, except the luxury to go where he wants and to do what he wants to, like any ordinary human being. But, as one eagle-eyed snapper discovered on a sunny Saturday afternoon at Berlin Zoo last month, Michael goes to extraordinary lengths to get a taste of &quot;normal&rdquo; life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That day, the hotel-bound singer had found the price of stardom too hard to beat and he had tearfully pleaded with his aides to find some way of getting him into the world famous zoo. However, he is warned to stay away. &quot;You would cause more mayhem than a big herd of charging elephants.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His worried staff plead with the zoo authorities to allow a special after-hours visit. A small fortune is offered, and turned down. &ldquo;Even the animals have to sleep&rdquo;, he&#39;s told.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So, there&rsquo;s only one thing for it. A makeup artist is called in to free Jackson from his fame, using a vital assortment of items kept in a special &ldquo;clothing trunk&quot; carried on tour with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And what a job she does - with the help of a false moustache made of real hair and bought in Los Angeles for &pound;90, a set of ugly false teeth to hide Michael&rsquo;s radiant smile, sinister-looking sunglasses, and cheek-length Elvis-style sideburns, which cost the star &pound;145. To cap it all, there&rsquo;s a baseball hat, one of 40 that Michael has with him on tour, all emblazoned with the letters N and Y, the abbreviation for New York. His hair is rolled up and hidden away inside the cap.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Looking a strange and unfamiliar sight, the star joyfully heads out through the crowded hotel lobby and begins the 6-block stroll to the zoo with his personal security chief and lifelong pal Billy Bray, who has been with him since the age of 5. The highly-trained bodyguard and driver, George Karwinski, tails them 10 yards behind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s free at last. The disguise is perfect. Even his own family wouldn&rsquo;t recognize him. Nobody tries to tear at his clothes or pull out his hair for a treasured memento. In fact, nobody gives him a second glance. When he arrives at the zoo entrance, Jackson, the multi-millionaire megastar, turns to Billy Bray and confesses, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Billy, I haven&#39;t got a dime on me. Can you lend me enough to get in?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once inside, the embarrassing cash crisis forgotten, Jackson marvels at the freedom his new face gives him as hordes of happy families brush past, unaware that they could easily reach out and touch the world&#39;s greatest rock star. &quot;They haven&#39;t got a clue who I am&quot;, he chuckles excitedly. Michael knows where he&rsquo;s heading &mdash; and studies a map of the zoo to find the home of a special friend, the famous orangutan Sari. At the cage, he joins a crowd of gleeful children, squatting down on his long legs to get level with the playful ape. After a laughter-filled half hour enjoying Sari&rsquo;s delightful capers, the animal-loving star makes his way towards the panda house to greet Bao Bao, Germany&#39;s most beloved bear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The photographer Peter Brunner stood watching the happy singer. &quot;I have never seen anybody get more enjoyment from being with animals&quot;, he says. &quot;It really was a great opportunity for me to take photos, but I didn&#39;t want to disturb his pleasure at that moment. Although he was heavily disguised, his natural radiance was all about him. Even Bao Bao sensed she had a VIP guest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It wasn&rsquo;t Michael&#39;s masterly disguise that Peter had cracked--he recognized the star from the presence of minder Billy Bray, who he had seen at the singer&#39;s side during the tour, which comes up to Leeds tomorrow. But photographer Brunner wasn&rsquo;t the only sharp-eyed person around. Jackson&#39;s efficient bodyguard, Jarwinski, recognized the photographer, who agreed to stand off and only take photos from a distance, so as not to spoil the precious day out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brunner held back as Jackson went off towards the antelope and zebra enclosures, and then to see the peacocks. &quot;He loved watching the birds spread their beautiful feathers. Maybe they gave him an idea for another costume.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Before he left, he returned to say farewell to Sari. He seemed to have struck up a friendship with the ape. Sari came right up to the bars and looked at him sadly&quot;, said Brunner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, as he was leaving, Michael stopped to talk to some young boys. &quot;The kids just looked up at Michael as if he was another friendly adult. They clearly had no idea of his true identity. When he had waved goodbye, I went up to the children and said, &#39;Do you know who that was? That was Michael Jackson.&#39; Their eyes lit up. They just couldn&#39;t believe they&rsquo;d met their hero.&quot;</span></p></body>
