Among the 60,000 in attendance, were Michael&#39;s dear friends Elizabeth Taylor and a party of ten and Sophia Loren, who brought a party of 25. Also present was former Sacramento Kings basketball star Reggie Theus (now with the Atlanta Hawks) who had been participating in a celebrity tennis tournament in Nice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">June 17, 1988 - Oona O&rsquo;Neil Chaplin (Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s Widow) Visit:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE"><a class="cs104BA6B9" href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21834624/the_boston_globe/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Boston Globe&rdquo; (June 20, 1988)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">	(<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190703173335/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21834624/the_boston_globe/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Moonwalker paid homage to The Little Tramp when Michael Jackson visited the widow of Charlie Chaplin at her home in Switzerland during a break in his European concert tour, a Swiss newspaper reported yesterday. The tabloid Sonntags Blick said Jackson visited Oona O&#39;Neill Chaplin - who is also the daughter of playwright Eugene O&#39;Neill - on Friday at her home in Vevey, overlooking Lake Geneva. The paper quoted Mrs. Chaplin as telling Jackson that he had &quot;a lot in common with her husband&quot; because they were both born poor and had to strive to achieve what they did. Sonntags Blick quoted Jackson as saying after the meeting, &quot;I have just fulfilled my biggest childhood dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rolf Knie, informal tour guide during the visit, &ldquo;L&#39;illustr&eacute;&rdquo; magazine, (July 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjackson.fr/index.php?/topic/1662-rolf-knie-raconte-sa-rencontre-avec-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100702145542/http://www.mjackson.fr/index.php?/topic/1662-rolf-knie-raconte-sa-rencontre-avec-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Over twenty years later, the feelings associated with this special day are always deep. The discovery of a simple and endearing Michael Jackson. The outrage at what has been said about him then &hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That day, the clown and now producer of the circus Salto Natale served as a guide in the famous mansion Ban inhabited by the Chaplin family, in Corsier-sur-Vevey. &ldquo;I remember the extreme politeness of Michael, his calmness, his shyness. I remember the way he waited for Oona Chaplin to sit down to do the same. It is these details which reveal someone. Since then, I leap to his defense when attacked. The journalists have invented rumors about him. For fifteen years, they will not stop the killing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Originally in the meeting, there was Geraldine Chaplin, the eldest daughter of Oona and Charlie Chaplin. At a concert of Michael which she attended, the singer said he admires her father. Geraldine called Rolf Knie, an old family friend and regular at the Manor. &ldquo;Michael would come to Corsier. Can you arrange something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a passage from Michael in Basel, Rolf Knie starts: he phoned his hotel and met his agent, Frank DiLeo. &ldquo;Some friends told me it was crazy and impossible &hellip; Half an hour later, however, reminiscent of Michael himself, he was very happy. We agreed to an appointment for a Friday to 15 hours.&rdquo; (3:00 p.m.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On that day, families await Knie, Chaplin, and the star. Around 15 h 30, the doorman came running in saying, &ldquo;Somebody just called, I did not catch his name.&rdquo; It was Michael. I took the phone. I was quite embarrassed, he apologized a thousand times. He had gotten lost and he was calling from a service station in Vevey &hellip; The porter is going to look there. The singer arrived without bodyguard, just accompanied by his assistant, a gentleman of a certain age. Then he played in the park with my son Gregory innocently. I think children take him as he is, he could finally be normal. It left a big impression.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another aspect of the star was impressive: &ldquo;He knew perfectly the life of Chaplin, a true lexicon. The dates of the films, the names of the actors, everything. The parallel between Jackson and Chaplin seems natural to him. Even poor children, even lawsuits against them. They emit the same wave and they experienced similar problems with the world as well. Both did not give interviews. They responded with their films or their music. Had they known each other, they would have spent whole days together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two months later, Michael Jackson called Oona Chaplin and Rolf Knie to be at his concert in Lausanne. &ldquo;Before the show, we visited him in his locker. There were long tables covered with caviar and salmon.&rdquo; Michael shrugged: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not for me, but my team is hungry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the end, Rolf and Oona witnessed the hasty departure of the star: &ldquo;The music still played when he was quickly engulfed in a car behind the scenes. I realized that Michael lived like this every day. He was a prisoner of his success. The clown keeps bitterness. Today I am angry against those who did not have mercy on him. And glad he found peace.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
