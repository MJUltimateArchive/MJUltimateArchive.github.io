We had a complete tour of the art treasures of the Louvre, including the fabled Mona Lisa. A crowd of at least 500 fans eager to get a glimpse of Michael stood outside our hotel constantly. He made a bit of history here, by becoming the first performer to play the Parc Des Princes (the site of the Pope&#39;s visits to Paris). There were 65,000 in attendance the first night and 69,000 the second! Among them were Albertine Bongo, daughter of the President of Gabon, a former French African colony. By the way, her mother, Josephine, owns Hollywood-based Elumba Recording Studios. Jet-setters were treated to a swinging after-party hosted by international Disco queen Regine, who attended the first show with a huge party and came back as our guest the following night.</span></p></body>
