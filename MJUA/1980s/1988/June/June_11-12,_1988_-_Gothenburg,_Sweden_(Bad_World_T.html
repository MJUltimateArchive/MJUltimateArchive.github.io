This was a very interesting stop for several reasons. First, the venue itself, Eriksberg, was actually a shipyard converted to a stadium for the two shows, with an attendance of 55,000 each. It was accessible only by ferry and the first night 150 small boats jockeyed for position to hear the concert. The occasion was also special in that Michael got to see Ragni Lantz Griffin (former wife of my predecessor at Motown, Junius Griffin, and herself a Motown associate) who resides here. At the urging of Gladys Knight, Ragni was present at the Gary talent show where The Jackson Five first came to the attention of the label. She later attended the group&#39;s first Hollywood engagement at the Daisy. A touching reunion to say the least!</span></p></body>
