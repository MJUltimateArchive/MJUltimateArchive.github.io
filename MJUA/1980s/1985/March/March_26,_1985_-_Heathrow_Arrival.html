Michael comes to London by Concorde. The newspapers report his activities every day--though many of the stories are exaggerated, if not totally fabricated.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, the person who manages the most coverage is Michael himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He hires a stills photographer and a video crew led by top TV film-maker David Elsbury to film his every move.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the end of his visit, he takes every photograph and every scrap of video--precisely 43 hours&#39; footage--home for his massive personal archive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In addition, Michael&#39;s management have been busy since the trip buying up the negatives for some of the best known pictures of his trip. One shot showing Michael atop his limousine outside Madame Tussauds, costs several thousand dollars.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sources close to the management ask whether a major autobiographical book and/or film is in the offing. Frank DiLeo neither confirms or denies it. He simply smiles. Michael stays at the Montcalm Hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A frequent visitor to Michael&#39;s hotel is actor Mark Lester, star of the musical film &quot;Oliver&quot;, who comes along with his sister.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and his team stayed at the Montcalm Hotel. He was visited by Mark Lester, who took his sister along.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While in London Michael brought over his own chef with him, Mani Khalsa.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael just loves Mexican food. I bake a batch of Mexican corn chips in the oven and then I melt some cheese on them and he eats the lot. I never fry any of Michael&rsquo;s food. I hardly ever use salt, never add sugar, and I try to use only natural ingredients.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael always fasted on Sundays, but Khalsa let fans in on how a typical menu would go:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Breakfast: Freshly squeezed fruit juice, usually orange. Fresh fruit and whole wheat waffles, blueberry muffins or whole wheat bread with cheese.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Snacks: Corn chips and some sauce dips, fruit, ice cream.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Supper: Corn chips with melted cheese and hot red chili sauce, or an avocado and sour cream dip. Mexican beans with herbs and spices served with rice or fresh vegetables, or whole wheat pizzas or vegetable pie.</span></p></body>
