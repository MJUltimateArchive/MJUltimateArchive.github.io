He was given a tour of the station by an Inspector Beer, who showed him, the cells, the communications system and the shoplifting unit. He was also given the chance to view a police lineup with notebooks and truncheons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Beer said: &ldquo;I just asked him about his plans and what he thought about the sights of London. He seemed a very ordinary sort of chap.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At an evening reception the same day Michael was presented with his award for Thriller going Platinum eight times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104917/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/maggers3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;No.1&rdquo; magazine (1985)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is Friday, March 29, 1985, the day after Michael Jackson&#39;s appearance at Madame Tussaud&#39;s. On this bright, clear afternoon, he dodges a knot of photographers and fans outside the Montcalm Hotel to pay a visit to the London Hospital. For the second time in two years, he&#39;s off to view the skeleton of The Elephant Man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Scarcely has Michael&#39;s black limousine left the hotel precincts then it is surrounded by a knot of screaming, yelling fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They paw the car and one twists off the quarterlight. Michael, cowering in the back, quickly pulls a coat up over his head.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Are you frightened of them, Michael?&quot;, asks a British aide as the car pulls clear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael uncovers his face and looks pensive. &quot;Onstage&quot;, he says, &quot;I&#39;m a hero. But offstage, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the star they want me to be...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ironic words. Because the whole of Michael&#39;s British visit shows him at last trying to be just the star the fans want.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An accessible one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He is deliberately trying to destroy the image of Jackson the recluse&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;Back To Whitechapel</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Friday March 29. Michael&#39;s lunchtime visit to the London Hospital is his second in two years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">En route, he fires questions about various landmarks such as Cleopatra&#39;s Needle, the date when the Houses of Parliament were built and whose statue is in the courtyard. (It&#39;s Oliver Cromwell&#39;s.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What&#39;s that place? It looks like a palace&quot;, he asks, pointing at the GLC&#39;s County Hall headquarters. And he listens with interest as an aide explains exactly what the Greater London Council is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a private teaching section of the London Hospital, six or seven students are busy revising when a familiar figure enters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The section which contains the skeleton of Elephant Man John Merrick, also has a number of other exhibits including jars containing pickled lungs and livers. But Michael&#39;s only interested in Merrick&#39;s skeleton, the famous hood that he wore over his head, and a small model of a church which Merrick made.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He spends just five minutes in the hospital. On the way to the car outside, a group of local Whitechapel kids can&#39;t believe their eyes. &quot;Is it him? Is it him?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael smiles and says hello. Someone points out the gold domes of a nearby mosque and tells Michael how it was built the wrong way--it doesn&#39;t face Mecca.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael collapses in mirth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Copping a Thriller</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At around 2:30pm that afternoon Michael visits Marylebone Police Station. His management had contacted the station only that morning to arrange the trip.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He stayed about an hour and a quarter&quot;, Marylebone&#39;s Chief Inspector Beer tells &quot;No.1&quot;. &quot;He visited our communications center, our cells, the shoplifting unit.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During a break in his guided tour, Michael enjoys a soft drink with Chief Inspector Beer in the senior officers&#39; canteen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just asked him about his plans&quot;, says Beer, &quot;and what he thought about the sights of London. He seemed a very ordinary sort of chap.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also inspected a line-up of police officers bearing notebooks and truncheons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That was misreported in the press&quot;, says Chief Inspector Beer. &quot;It was not a guard of honor--it was just an ordinary parade for the late turn shift. Michael seemed impressed anyway.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At a small reception at CBS Records during the evening Michael is presented with a disc to celebrate the &quot;Thriller&quot; album going platinum.
