While in London last March to see his wax figure unveiled at Madame Tussaud&#39;s, he dropped in on the dreary meetings—and brightened everyone&#39;s mood.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s a lot more fun selling something to a superstar than a corporation and the visit reminded everyone that they were dealing with a superstar,&quot; Stiffelman said. &quot;Michael showed up in his whole, colorful Sgt. Pepper&#39;s uniform—and he signed autographs for all the office workers. He was very impressive and he definitely helped get things moving.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;No.1&rdquo; magazine (1985) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808104917/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/maggers3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">March 28. Michael visits Madame Tussauds to view his waxwork in the newly-opened Superstars gallery.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In between a session posing for TV cameras and another for newspaper photographers, Michael visits the modeling studio on the floor above the exhibition. And comes face to face, for the second time in a day, with himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Hope McNally (a Tussauds artist) was working on a second cast of Michael from the same mold&quot;, explains a press officer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was for our other exhibition in Amsterdam. She was inserting hair into the head one hair at a time as is the usual procedure.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He does not—as reported— visit the Chamber of Horrors. &ldquo;He&#39;d already seen that,&rdquo; says the press officer. &quot;He came on a private visit with the rest of The Jackson 5 around 1975/76.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;At the photocall in the Super Stars room, Michael mounts a step-ladder to join his waxwork on a raised podium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The photographers, who have been jostling heatedly for a good position, yell instructions at him in time-honored Fleet Street fashion. &quot;Look this way, Michael! Come round the other side! Hold up your hand!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s patience and good nature are again at odds with his image. He smiles, even laughs a little at all the attention, gives one-word answers to shouted questions because in that atmosphere, there&#39;s little else he can do to communicate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And finally, in response to a shouted instruction, he removes his sunglasses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Big-brown eyes blink shyly at the hardened throng. And the hardened throng collectively sighs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Corio, photographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://davidcorio.com/photos/252-michael-jackson-madame-tussauds-wax-museum-on-baker-street-euston-road-london-uk-march-28-1985"><span class="cs8567212B">website entry</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson was at Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s to unveil his waxwork. He was only 28 years old. Due to his popularity two photo-shoots had been organized with 60 photographers set up on terraces for each session. I was in the second session and it was a mob scene. Surrounded by heavy security, Michael posed with his waxwork smiling professionally at the onslaught of flash-guns. During the whole session he kept his sunglasses on. Just as he was leaving he took them off and turned to look at the photographers once more. He suddenly looked vulnerable and alone. This (Image 025) is that shot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">British fans were given a real treat in March 1985 when Michael flew in to unveil his wax work figure for Madame Tussauds. Having been disappointed that the Victory tour was not going to be extended to Europe because Michael didn&rsquo;t want to do it, the visit saw scenes reminiscent of Beatlemania in the 60s, bringing London to a standstill on the day of unveiling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The idea to first visit his London waxwork model was when he sat for sculptor Jim Mathieson in November 1984. Mathieson took photographs and did drawings of Michael that he could take back to London to work on...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the unveiling on 28th March, 1985 it was sheer pandemonium at the venue, as the surrounding streets were brought to a standstill. Thousands of fans fought to get a close up of him and had to wait another hour or so before seeing him again. When he did leave, he stood on top of his limousine to wave to the crowd. It was reported later that his heels on his shoe had caused a few thousand pounds worth of damage to the Daimlers roof.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael viewed his model in the new Super Stars gallery. Hope McNally worked on a second version from the same model for the Amsterdam exhibition. The press were given an opportunity to take photos of Michael with the model. He told them he loved it.</span></p></body>
