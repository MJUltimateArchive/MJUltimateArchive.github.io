He&#39;s going to be so prominent in the next decade or so because he really knows what he wants to do. The ballad that he wrote for me is not a ballad you write from the tip of your head; it comes from observing and from a gift that is deep within.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tune was recorded in one day and includes Earl Klugh and a number of other top musicians on the track. &ldquo;At the end of the day we came up with something that we think is wonderful and I just hope everyone will like it&rdquo;, she said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She added, &ldquo;I think everyone is going to like it, the pop audience as well as my regular R&amp;B audience.

It&rsquo;s like an &lsquo;I am Love&rsquo; type of ballad&rdquo;, she revealed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tune is expected to hit record stores and radio stations in a couple of weeks.</span></p></body>
