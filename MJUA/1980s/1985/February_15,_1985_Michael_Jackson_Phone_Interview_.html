		<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a phone interview from Los Angeles on February 15, 1985, Michael admitted to me his problems with the tour and the pressures of working with his family&mdash;especially after having had such huge solo success.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">I haven&rsquo;t seen you since the Garden.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I know. What have you been doing? Do you still love New York?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Of course.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Better than L.A.?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">You know, I haven&rsquo;t been out to L.A. in so long . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You don&rsquo;t like us out here?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">I think it&rsquo;s too . . . bright. Anyway, were you happy with the tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well . . . ummm . . . it depends. I never really wanted to use a lot of the people we had, but it became a voting thing. It was unfair to me, you know? I was outvoted a lot of times. I never liked doing things that way. I always liked using A1 people who are considered excellent in their field. I&rsquo;ve always tried to do everything first-class. Use people who are the best. But it was a different story with the family. And the fact that it was the biggest tour that ever happened, and my success has been so overwhelming, it&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re waiting to throw darts at you, too. . . . You know [Barbra] Streisand once said . . . um, I taped it, on </span><span class="cs43C038A">20/20,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> she said she first came out, she&rsquo;s new and fresh, everybody loved her, and they built her up and then . . . they knocked her down. And she felt, you know, &lsquo;Oh, is that </span><span class="cs43C038A">it?</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rsquo; You know, she&rsquo;s human, she can&rsquo;t take it, she can&rsquo;t just forget about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Well, when you get that big, there is this backlash . . . people get jealous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I know. Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s going through that . . . But I&rsquo;m a strong person. I don&rsquo;t let any of it bother me. I love doing what I do and I&rsquo;m gonna keep moving mountains and doing bigger and better things because it makes people happy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">I heard some of the fans were upset because the ticket prices were high.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You know, that wasn&rsquo;t my idea. None of that was my idea. I was outvoted. I mean, mail order . . . I didn&rsquo;t want that&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want the ticket price the way it was . . . our production was so big, it had to pay for itself, but still, even then, I didn&rsquo;t want the ticket price so high. But . . . I was outvoted . . . Don King . . . all of it, I was outvoted. And it&rsquo;s tough, especially when it&rsquo;s your family. Like Lionel Richie said with the Commodores, he would do the same thing, and he would say, &lsquo;Can we talk about it?&rsquo; But they&rsquo;re not his brothers. . . . It&rsquo;s hard to see your brother and they&rsquo;re upset with something and you can look in their eyes and see it, or they won&rsquo;t talk to you. But I&rsquo;m going to do bigger and better things in the future. I&rsquo;m compelled to do what I&rsquo;m doing and I can&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I love performing. I love creating and coming up with unusual new things. To be a kind of pioneer. You know, innovative. I just love it. I get excited about ideas, not about money; ideas is what excites me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">The conception about you is that you&rsquo;re totally insulated and isolated, locked up, can&rsquo;t go anywhere</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, a lot of that is true, but I get a chance to have fun, you know. I show films, and I play games and have friends over sometimes, and I love children and stuff. I get to play with them; that&rsquo;s one of my favorite things to do. Performing is fun. I miss that, but I&rsquo;ve been writing a lot of good stuff lately and I&rsquo;m real excited about the songs I&rsquo;m coming up with.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">Wherever I go in the world, I hear your songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it just proves that what you put into something you get out of it. And I put my soul, my blood, sweat, and tears, into </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I really did. And not only was it </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> but I was doing </span><span class="cs43C038A">E.T.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> at the same time, the </span><span class="cs43C038A">E.T.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [soundtrack] album. And that was a lot of stress. But [when we first] mixed the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album, it sounded like crap.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L.R.</span><span class="cs43C038A">What?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">M.J.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, it was terrible. And I cried at the listening party. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;we can&rsquo;t release this.&rdquo; I called a meeting with Quincy, and everybody at the [record] company was screaming that we had to have it out and there was a deadline, and I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not releasing it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible.&rdquo; So we re-did a mix a day. Like a mix a day. And we rested two days, then we did a mixing. We were overworked, but it all came out O.K.</span></p></body>
