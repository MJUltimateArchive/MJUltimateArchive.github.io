I wrote the song with Lionel Richie after seeing the appalling news footage of starving people in Ethiopia and the Sudan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Around that time, I used to ask my sister Janet to follow me into a room with interesting acoustics, like a closet or the bathroom, and I&rsquo;d sing to her, just a note, a rhythm of a note. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a lyric or anything; I&rsquo;d just hum from the bottom of my throat. I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Janet, what do you see? What do you see when you hear this sound?&rdquo; And this time she said, &ldquo;Dying children in Africa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s what I was dictating from my soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about Africa. You&rsquo;re talking about dying children.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s where &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; came from. We&rsquo;d go in a dark room and I&rsquo;d sing notes to her. To my mind, that&rsquo;s what singers should be able to do. We should be able to perform and be effective, even if it&rsquo;s in a dark room. We&rsquo;ve lost a lot because of TV. You should be able to move people without all that advanced technology, without pictures, using only sound.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;ve been performing for as long as I can remember. I know a lot of secrets, a lot of things like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think that &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; is a very spiritual song, but spiritual in a special sense. I was proud to be a part of that song and to be one of the musicians there that night. We were united by our desire to make a difference. It made the world a better place for us and it made a difference to the starving people we wanted to help.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We collected some Grammy Awards and began to hear easy-listening versions of &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; in elevators along with &ldquo;Billie Jean.&rdquo; Since first writing it, I had thought that song should be sung by children. When I finally heard children singing it on producer George Duke&rsquo;s version, I almost cried. It&rsquo;s the best version I&rsquo;ve heard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &ldquo;Entertainment Tonight&rdquo; special transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Co-writing &ldquo;We Are The World&rdquo; with Lionel Richie just had to be the most satisfying time of my professional career...

It was like it was discriminating the rest of the world. I asked for the Bee Gees, I asked for other groups and they said &ldquo;Well, they weren&rsquo;t born here&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I just want the world to show that they care&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love working quickly.

I am screaming like the last horror movie... and he (Jackson) goes, &#39;Oh my God, there he is. Y&#39;know Lionel, he was lost in the room. I knew he was here somewhere.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I said to him, &#39;Michael, are you telling me you had a python in your room...?&#39; He said, &#39;He&#39;s been lost for a week.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Oprah&rsquo;s Master Class&rdquo; (June 22, 2014) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.littlethings.com/lionel-richie-we-are-the-world/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy walks in the door and says, &ldquo;I need the song </span><span class="cs43C038A">now</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.&rdquo; And a day later, we had the bones for &ldquo;We Are the World.&rdquo; We show up at the studio and do the demo. Back then you couldn&rsquo;t email it. You had to put it on a cassette and send it to people. So we had people agreeing to be involved with a song they haven&rsquo;t heard yet. And of course, what [the song] did do was beyond our wildest imagination. We became a country unto itself. We became the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/oQTnPPt15cQ"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Talk&rdquo; talk show (March 13, 2018)</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.music-news.com/news/UK/111705/Lionel-Richie-frightened-by-animal-encounters-at-Michael-Jackson-s-house"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael loved to collect animals...,&quot; Lionel told U.S. show The Talk on Tuesday (13Mar18), &quot;so right in the middle of writing this song we&#39;re eating downstairs and there&#39;s this dog barking hysterically... And then we heard, &#39;Shut up, shut up!&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;m thinking to myself, &#39;What&#39;s going on, Michael?&#39; He said, &#39;That&#39;s the bird. That&#39;s the bird having an argument with the dog&#39;. So we went back into the kitchen and there&#39;s the bird in the cage and the dog is barking at the bird and the bird is going, &#39;Shut up, shut up&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, Lionel&#39;s next animal encounter at the house wasn&#39;t quite as amusing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It gets worse,&quot; he continued. &quot;I&#39;m laying on the floor and we&#39;re working on the lyrics... and I hear a (breathing sound)... I&#39;m looking at Michael and all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye the albums that were against the wall were falling down. I&#39;m thinking to myself, &#39;Well what could this be?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I look over and there is an albino python and he goes, &#39;There he is Lionel, we found him. We knew he was in the room somewhere Lionel, but we weren&#39;t sure. He wants to come out and play with you&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was screaming like the last woman in a horror movie, I was screaming so loud. He kept saying, &#39;Why are you screaming?&#39; I said, &#39;Baby, that&#39;s a snake, he might be your pet. I&#39;m from Alabama, that&#39;s a snake&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Quincy Jones, &ldquo;Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues&rdquo; documentary (March 12, 1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For years, Michael and I had been talking about a song that was like an eighties version of &ldquo;Bridge Over Troubled Water&rdquo; &ndash; a faith song of the eighties you know that would be an anthem. &nbsp;He and Lionel got together and we had to have that song quick and he jumped dead in the middle of it. I mean, it was right on target and just what we needed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bob Geldof, singer, &ldquo;Is That It?&rdquo; autobiography (1986)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Each [take] was perfect, and for anyone else would have been a take, rather than a practice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">J. Randy Taraborrelli, &ldquo;Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madness&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the Victory tour, Michael became involved in &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo;, the historic effort to feed the hungry of Ethiopia. For some time, Harry Belafonte had been making plans to draw together some of the biggest artists in the entertainment business to record a song, the proceeds of which would go to a new nonprofit foundation, USA for Africa, to feed the starving masses. In addition to providing emergency food, medical relief, and self-help programmes to stricken areas of Africa, the undertaking was also to set aside funds for hunger relief in the United States. Harry contacted Ken Kragen, an entertainment manager with a history of fundraising, to ask if he could enlist his clients, Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie, in the endeavour. Kenny and Lionel, in turn, obtained the cooperation of Stevie Wonder to add more name value to the project. Lionel then telephoned Michael to ask if he would perform on the recording. He not only wanted to sing on the song, Michael said, he also wanted to help Lionel write it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has always been empathetic to the plight of the hungry, homeless and sick, especially children. In the past, Frank Dileo has told many heartbreaking stories of Michael&#39;s influence on dying children. It is as though an unexplainable part within Michael is able to reach children close to death; his touch seems to act as some kind of soothing balm for kids facing a frightening time. It&#39;s an important, positive side of Michael, and one he thinks is the best thing about himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...While working on &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo;, Lionel Richie went to Hayvenhurst every night for a week where he and Michael sequestered themselves in Michael&#39;s room to labour on lyrics and melodies. They knew that what they wanted was some sort of anthem, a song both easy to sing and memorable. Though Michael and Lionel have never said as much publicly, LaToya &ndash; who watched the pair work &ndash; claims that Lionel only wrote a couple of lines of the song. She contends that 99 per cent of the lyrics were written by Michael, &lsquo;but he&#39;s never felt it necessary to say that.&rsquo; The lyrics and the melody were finished on 21 January 1985, just one night before the recording session.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While Michael and Lionel were composing, Ken Kragen went about the business of lining up the all-star cast: Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner, Bette Midler, Billy Joel, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, The Pointer Sisters, Stevie Wonder, Cyndi Lauper, Willie Nelson, Smokey Robinson, Bob Dylan and many others, forty-five in all. Another fifty artists had to be turned down to keep the project from becoming too unwieldy. Michael asked LaToya to show up, and she did. (She got to stand next to Bette Midler in the line-up.) Marlon, Jackie, Tito and Randy were also there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy Jones took time away from producing the film The Colour Purple to produce and arrange (with Tom Bahler) the Jackson &ndash; Richie collaboration at A&amp;M Studios in Hollywood. Because the American Music Awards had been held that same night, many of the artists came directly from those festivities. When the performers showed up, the first thing they saw was a sign outside Studio A: &lsquo;Please check your egos at the door.&rsquo; It was astonishing that so many artists of diverse backgrounds and individual renown were able to do just that: there were no ego problems, at all. Diana Ross could not conceal her excitement and asked the other stars for autographs. The Pointer Sisters took pictures of Michael. &lsquo;I&#39;ve never before felt that strong sense of community,&rsquo; Kenny Loggins observed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At around ten p.m., the proceedings turned solemn. Ken Kragen addressed the group to assure them that money generated from the recording would, indeed, &lsquo;go to the right places&rsquo;. Bob Geldof, the leader of the Boomtown Rats and organizer of the British Band Aid musical charity effort, which produced the single, &lsquo;Do They Know It&#39;s Christmas?&rsquo; told of his visits to Ethiopia. Two Ethiopian women, whose presence had been arranged by Stevie Wonder, reported on the horrible suffering there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finally, Michael addressed the assemblage of stars. Very quietly and somewhat awkwardly, he explained his and Lionel&#39;s composition as &lsquo;A love song to inspire concern about a faraway place close to home.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The musical tracks had been recorded earlier in the day, so it was just a matter of fine-tuning the lyrics &ndash; &lsquo;Should it be &ldquo;brighter day&rdquo; or &ldquo;better day&rdquo;?&rsquo; &ndash; and adding the voices. Michael taught the artists the melody and lyrics &ndash; most had already been sent taped demos of the song with Michael performing &ndash; and worked with them on vocal arrangements.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As integral as Michael Jackson had become to the process, he was also very much separated from it. Whereas everyone else present was filmed (by six cameras) as they performed for the &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo; video, Michael&#39;s solo was taped later, privately, and spliced into the final version. He never took off his shades. Some people speculate that he chose not to record with the rest because he was so awestruck by his fellow celebrities. The ultimate perfectionist, he would feel that he could not perform to the best of his abilities in front of them. Others offer a more cynical explanation: Michael likes to feel he is different from everybody and emphasizes this difference by erecting barriers between him and his fans, his peers and his family. Indeed, in the video of &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo;, the shot of Michael begins at his Bass Weejun shoes and trademark sequined socks, and then pans upward to his carefully made-up face, all at Michael&#39;s direction. &lsquo;People will know it&#39;s me as soon as they see the socks,&rsquo; he said, proudly, and he was right about that. &lsquo;Try taking footage of Bruce Springsteen&#39;s socks and see if anyone knows who they belong to,&rsquo; he added with a grin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The recording and taping session took all night. Who would sing what and with whom had been decided a couple of days earlier by Lionel Richie, producer Quincy Jones, and arranger Tom Bahler. Some of the interesting vocal pairings included Tina Turner with Billy Joel, Dionne Warwick with Willie Nelson, and, of course, Diana Ross with Michael Jackson. The only hint of things not going as planned involved the pairing of Michael and Prince. Michael didn&#39;t like Prince, but for charity he would sing with him. However, Prince didn&#39;t even show up. At six the next morning, he called the studio to ask if he might come in and lay down a guitar part. Quincy told him it was too late.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By seven-thirty in the morning, the job was done and the artists began to leave. &lsquo;Michael was as exhausted as anyone,&rsquo; Jeffrey Osborne reported. &lsquo;He didn&#39;t say much, maybe something about being very happy, but I could tell that he was delighted.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;I did expect to see more ego,&rsquo; Paul Simon reported. &lsquo;You know, &ldquo;The Gloved One&rdquo; meets &ldquo;The Boss&rdquo; and things like that, but it just didn&#39;t happen.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;I just don&#39;t want this night to end,&rsquo; Diana Ross said as she hugged Tina Turner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It would seem that everyone who participated in the &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo; recording session shared Diana&#39;s sentiments. The gentle, uplifting spirit of the song also touched the public&#39;s emotions when it was finally released on 7 March 1985. The initial shipment of 800,000 records sold out within three days of its release. The song was number one in America for a month, and also spent a couple of weeks at the top spot in Britain, as well as in other countries. The &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo; video lent itself well to the benevolent spirit of the celebration and helped to sell four million records in all, earning about eight million dollars for the USA for Africa fund.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8rADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22idea+over+health+food+dinners%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7aouMgWD5K&amp;sig=ACfU3U2a4SM4eka29zZsDShpy1c7vlHmfw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi3tNy3v4LhAhVEbKwKHd4ICV4Q6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22idea%20over%20health%20food%20dinners%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Jet&quot; magazine (April 8, 1985)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When singer/songwriter Michael Jackson got a call one day from Lionel Richie, then leader of The Commodores vocal group that was once the opening act for The Jackson Five, he was surprised twice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First, Richie told him that he (Richie) was going to produce his first album for country singing star Kenny Rogers. Second, Jackson was surprised that his long-time friend wanted him as a backup singer for the session.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richie rationalized his request and later joked: &quot;We decided that if we never had another hit record, we could always make $100,000 a year singing back- ground parts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since that record session, the lead singer of The Jacksons became the world&#39;s greatest solo recording artist of all time with his Thriller album which has sold over 40 million copies, and Richie has established himself as a singer/songwriter of solo albums that won him Grammy and American Music Awards while selling as many as four million copies of a single LP.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So it was inevitable that the two would some day team again in a music project. The two nice guys, at the urging of singer Harry Belafonte, the follow-up of Richie&#39;s manager, Ken Kragen, and the smooth operation of producer Quincy Jones, got together on what may turn out to be the biggest money-making project of all time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They co-wrote a hit song, We Are The World, that was recorded by 45 of America&#39;s top recording artists under the name USA for Africa. The hit single is already earning millions for Africa&#39;s famine victims and by the time the group releases its We Are The World album and videos featuring the best-selling single, the sales may soar to as much as $50 million.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Belafonte, an entertainer and social activist, is credited with being the moving force behind the music project and he says a film prodded him to act. &quot;I was looking at some film not long ago from sub-Saharan Africa: Mali, Chad, the Sudan, Ethiopia,&quot; he said. &quot;After you see the pictures and hear the voices of those people, it&#39;s very hard to sleep, and it&#39;s very hard to go on with business as usual. &quot; Then he saw Band Aid&#39;s musical effort to aid famine victims and said, &quot;I simply thought, &#39;Why not here?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Belafonte contacted Kragen, who brought it to Richie&#39;s attention. Richie was so eager that he promptly called Quincy Jones, who agreed to produce the recording. Jones then contacted Jackson and it was decided that the popular singer/songwriter would co-write a new song for the project.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richie and Jackson discussed the idea over health food dinners, including three meals at Jackson&#39;s home. Finally, Richie walked in with a melody and some lyrics. Jackson listened and Richie left. That same night, Jackson finished the song and they titled it: We Are The World.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With the song, Kragen assumed the role of recruiter of talent. He wanted &quot;the top of the charts artists,&quot; he recalls. He went about the task of assembling the &quot;cream of American pop talent&quot; and was ready to roll on January 28. The session got underway about 10 p.m., two hours after the conclusion of the American Music Awards telecast which was hosted by Richie. A number of the USA for Africa artists also took part in the Awards program.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was an honor for me to co-write a song that will hopefully affect the world,&quot; a weary Michael Jackson said as he departed the session with his manager, Frank Dileo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As reporters rushed in to get interviews, Dileo ushered Jack- son out of the A &amp; M Studio, saying: &quot;Let the song speak for itself. He didn&#39;t write for publicity. He wrote to help starving people.&quot; Later, Jackson&#39;s manager told JET: &quot;I was happy that Michael chose to do something like that between his future releases. I think his enthusiasm was transmitted to the whole session. Michael was the first to arrive after Quincy,&quot; Dileo pointed out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richie reacted to the session saying: &quot;It was a very moving evening. I walked into the studio as a fan and I&#39;m sure a lot of others did, too. It was a studio full of people wanting other people&#39;s autographs. But the most Important theme of the evening, I think, is in the lyrics of the song: &#39;There are people dying.&#39; Every artist here is committed to doing something about that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/27/arts/the-pop-life-artists-join-in-effort-for-famine-relief.html?&amp;pagewanted=all"><span class="cs8567212B">New York Times (February 27, 1985)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">ON March 11, Columbia Records will release &#39;&#39;We Are the World,&#39;&#39; a new song written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson and performed by a chorus of 45 pop stars calling themselves USA for Africa (United Support of Artists for Africa). Roughly 90 percent of the proceeds from the single and an album to be released April 1, as well as a full- length video and related merchandising, will be donated to African famine relief. Another 10 percent will go to fight homelessness and malnutrition in the United States.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;We Are the World&#39;&#39; is an American response to &#39;&#39;Do They Know It&#39;s Christmas?,&#39;&#39; the single that was recorded late last year in London by Band Aid, a group of British rock stars. The record became the most successful single in British history, selling 3.5 million copies in Britain and 2.5 million in the United States and raising $9.2 million.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;We Are the World&#39;&#39; originated last December with a telephone call from Harry Belafonte to Ken Kragen, the manager of Lionel Richie, Kenny Rogers and other top pop acts. &#39;&#39;If Jews were starving in Israel, American Jews would have raised millions,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Belafonte, whose idea it was to organize a black superstar benefit concert.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Kragen contacted Mr. Ritchie, who in turn contacted Michael Jackson and the producer Quincy Jones. Mr. Ritchie and Mr. Jackson spent four days writing the song, and on Jan. 22 Mr. Jones and a group of top Los Angeles studio musicians recorded the rhythm and instrumental tracks and also made a demo with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Ritchie that was sent to all the artists involved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What had begun as a supersession of black singers expanded after Bruce Springsteen agreed to become involved. Some of the stars who ended up donating their talents were Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Cyndi Lauper, Huey Lewis, Paul Simon and Dionne Warwick. The vocals were recorded on Jan. 28 in a marathon 10-hour recording session at A&amp;M Recording Studios in Los Angeles. The single, whose long version runs over seven minutes, includes 21 separate vocal solos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;We Are the World&#39;&#39; is more than an unprecedented communal collaboration among pop music&#39;s elite for a good cause - it is an artistic triumph that transcends its &#39;&#39;official&#39;&#39; nature. The Band Aid single was a cheery pop carol that tended to homogenize individual voices into a jingly singalong. By contrast, the vocal solos on &#39;&#39;We Are the World&#39;&#39; have been artfully interwoven to emphasize the individuality of each singer. The record opens with Lionel Richie&#39;s calm, almost ministerial singing, followed by Stevie Wonder&#39;s reedier, more urgent response; Michael Jackson comes in at the chorus. Recorded against a solemn mantric drone that recalls the mood of George Harrison&#39;s &#39;&#39;My Sweet Lord,&#39;&#39; the voices are layered in a way so as to create a sense of continuous surprise and emotional buildup. Mr. Springsteen, Mr. Dylan, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Charles and Miss Lauper contribute especially powerful vocal fragments.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song, a simple, eloquent ballad whose opening measures recall Bob Seger&#39;s &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve Got Tonight,&#39;&#39; is a fully-realized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it weren&#39;t recorded by stars. And the lines &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a choice we&#39;re making / We&#39;re saving our own lives&#39;&#39; assume an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar mystiques.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &#39;&#39;We Are the World&#39;&#39; album, which Quincy Jones is supervising, will include previously unreleased tracks by a number of major stars. Linda Ronstadt is contributing &#39;&#39;Keeping Out of Mischief,&#39;&#39; Prince &#39;&#39;Tears in Your Eyes,&#39;&#39; and Bruce Springsteen a live version of Jimmy Cliff&#39;s &#39;&#39;Trapped.&#39;&#39; Chicago and Tina Turner have also promised to contribute cuts. A Canadian coalition calling itself Northern Lights and including Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Anne Murray, Bryan Adams, Gordon Lightfoot and Oscar Peterson, among many others, has recorded a song for the record called &#39;&#39;Tears Are Not Enough.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The entire &#39;&#39;We Are the World&#39;&#39; recording session was filmed by a camera crew for a full-length video to be released at a later date, and among its live-in-the-studio vignettes will be Stevie Wonder teaching the song on the piano to Bob Dylan and the entire company surprising Mr. Belafonte with a spontaneous rendition of his mid-50&#39;s hit &#39;&#39;The Banana Boat Song (Day-O).&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;Every company wanted the record, but we went with CBS for two reasons,&#39;&#39; said Mr. Kragen. &#39;&#39;Having released the Band Aid single, they had learned how to deal with the pricing and distribution problems. They also had the most artists involved in the project. Hopefully, it will grow into something of real substance that is more than just a song. It&#39;s not just about raising money but raising consciousness to change priorities.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A White Rock Singer With Motown AppealTeena Marie, the former protege of the rock-funk star Rick James, is one of the few white singers to captivate a predominantly black audience with her volcanically soulful wailing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;I grew up on the border of the black ghetto in Venice, Calif.,&#39;&#39; she recalled recently. &#39;&#39;The singers I most admire are the ones with big lungs like Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan and Patti Labelle. It was always my dream to be the first successful white female artist on Motown. A lot of people still think I&#39;m black.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 27-year-old singer realized her dream when she was only 19. But after recording three albums for the label, the last of which sold 800,000 copies, she dropped from view. At Motown, she had been drawing a salary of $800 a week, and she sued to get off the label. A long legal wrangle ended in an out-of-court settlement in her favor, and Miss Marie moved to Epic Records.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Miss Marie&#39;s change of address hasn&#39;t diluted her sound. Her sobbing delivery remains one of the most nakedly emotional in all of pop. After a shaky start on her new label, her second Epic album &#39;&#39;Star Child&#39;&#39; has yielded one of her most popular singles to date, &#39;&#39;Lovergirl,&#39;&#39; which is No. 14 on Billboard&#39;s Hot 100 and climbing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A Hot Seller for Roth</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&#39;s hot? David Lee Roth, the lead singer of the Los Angeles heavy- metal band Van Halen, has put out a four-cut extended-play record, &#39;&#39;Crazy From the Heat,&#39;&#39; that has sold 800,000 copies for Warner Bros. Records in just two weeks. The raspy- voiced, long-haired singer who flaunts an exaggerated burlesque- show sexiness has been one of the stars to benefit the most from the rise of music-video. He is the class cutup of rock-and-roll - a droll, sometimes profane concert performer who never appears to take himself or his audience very seriously.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In &#39;&#39;Crazy From the Heat,&#39;&#39; this master of crowd manipulation has made a record that is slightly more grown-up than the records of Van Halen. Breaking out of the heavy- metal genre, he sings a lusty reprise of the Beach Boys&#39; &#39;&#39;California Girls&#39;&#39; (No. 3 on Billboard&#39;s singles chart and rising fast), the Lovin&#39; Spoonful&#39;s &#39;&#39;Coconut Grove&#39;&#39; and an iconoclastic rock-and-roll rendition of the cabaret standard &#39;&#39;Just a Gigolo.&#39;&#39;</span></p></body>
