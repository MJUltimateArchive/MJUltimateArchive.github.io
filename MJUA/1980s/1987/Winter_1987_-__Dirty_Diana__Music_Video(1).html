The coolest thing- [laughs] The funniest thing about the video was I pull up to the shoot, and there&#39;s a van outside, and I get out, and I kinda look at it, and it&#39;s got all these kids&#39; toys, and jungle gym, and all this stuff set up. I go, &quot;Wow, somebody&#39;s kid&#39;s got it made, he&#39;s got a whole playground out here.&rdquo; And it turns out, it&#39;s for Bubbles the chimp [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trunk: I remember the video was, like, white sheets blowing and stuff, right? It was kind of like, silhouettey?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stevens: Yeah... The guy Joe Pytka, who was the director, had done all the Pepsi adverts and stuff like that. And I realized all the other- the rest of the guys, and the band there, were all kind of stand-ins and I&#39;m looking at &#39;em going, &quot;Man, they all have wigs on and shit&quot; [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/tqdJyWunEYw"><span class="cs8567212B">Luka Neskovic interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shooting the video was incredible as well, a day I&#39;ll never forget. I think, actually, a lot of the takes that we did that didn&#39;t end up in the video were even more incredible. There was one point, unfortunately the camera angles weren&#39;t correct, but there&#39;s one point where I was playing and Michael ran across the stage and literally slid between my legs and came behind me and kind of pulled my guitar out of my hands. And the whole crew and everybody just erupted in applause, but [laughs] I guess the angles weren&#39;t correct, they didn&#39;t get the best version of that, so that&#39;s not in the video... There&#39;s a lot of time spent when you&#39;re not shooting, when they&#39;re just setting up for shots, and we just talked about rock n&#39; roll music. I remember him telling me that his favorite rock band was Queen, and that he knew Freddie Mercury, and he had seen a bunch of Queen shows, and he said that, for his next tour, he really wanted to have as much of a visual show as Queen did. And I had never seen Queen, so I was kind of explaining what a Billy Idol show was like, he hadn&#39;t seen us, and then he asked me about M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e. He asked me if I knew M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e [laughs] I said I didn&#39;t know M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, I was from New York, but I knew the New York Dolls [laughs].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lisa Dean, &ldquo;Legs&rdquo; actress, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ijkjfk"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Dirty Diana Reveals More Than Her Legs&rdquo; article</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You may not recognize the face but you&#39;ll never forget the legs. Long, lithe and luscious, they belong to California model Lisa Dean and she&#39;s Michael Jackson&#39;s co-star in the Dirty Diana video. He wanted the girl with the sexiest, steamiest, dreamiest pair of legs in the world to promote his hit single. And what Mr Jackson wants - he gets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So more than 200 top models bared their legs in secret auditions for the millionaire singer personally viewed them on video. When he saw Lisa&#39;s lovely legs screamed: &quot;That&#39;s her! That&#39;s Dirty Diana. I don&#39;t want to look at any more legs. That&#39;s it - I&#39;ve found her!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since the video first appeared, the beautiful brunette has been offered movie roles by top Hollywood directors, including Warren Beatty, signed her own record contract, recorded her first single, and now she&#39;s set to star in her own rock video - repeating her role as Dirty Diana.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But 28-year-old Lisa&#39;s big acting break has come in a part which is far removed from her own demure lifestyle. &quot;Dirty Diana couldn&#39;t be less like me.&quot; she says. &quot;The lady in that song is no lady. She is the ultimate groupie, wanting to sleep with any, and every, rock star in town. I&#39;ve never been that sort of cheap, on-the-prowl nymphomaniac painted lady. But I can easily look that way with the right clothes and make-up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I was called to audition. I was told that Michael Jackson wasn&#39;t just looking for the best legs around. He said I had to be a sexy bitch - Dirty Diana had to be the baddest, sexiest, bitchiest, most elegant and drop-dead beautiful woman ever seen on the screen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;At first, I wasn&#39;t sure I could be that good, but gave it my best shot. When I first saw the finished video, even I was astonished at how sexy I looked. They had squeezed me into the tightest, shortest skirt possible - it was less than 12 inches long. I wore no stocking, and I was teetering in high, high heels.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;At first, I was so upset that all people were seeing was my legs. Isn&#39;t it just great! Finally I&#39;m working with Michael Jackson. I&#39;ll be seen by millions of people around the world - and nobody will recognize me. That was very disappointing, but the video director told me it was better to keep the mystery of the face behind the legs, and let people wonder. And he was right. So much interest has followed, and so many opportunities.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before the Dirty Diana video, Lisa had been a model for 10 years and lived in Milan, Paris, London, Tokyo and New York. She&#39;s appeared on Vogue covers and dozens of TV.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-03/entertainment/ca-8781_1_dirty-diana"><span class="cs8567212B">LA Times</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (July 3, 1988)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 5 foot 9, &quot;mid-20s&quot; Vogue cover girl was picked from hundreds of auditioning beauties. Dean&#39;s secret to gorgeous gams: &quot;Daily exercise, years of ballroom and jazz dancing, and just being naturally skinny.&quot; Her looks have also landed her TV spots for Levi&#39;s 501s and Sprite, plus the 1984 video for Ratt&#39;s &quot;Round and Round&quot;--playing someone so obsessed by the group&#39;s heavy metal music that she begins ripping off her rubber mini-dress.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As for Jackson: He&#39;s a &quot;quite magical, sweet and gentle person&quot; who never flirted--but did spend a lot of time on the set with his favorite chimp, Bubbles. Dean&#39;s only complaints about making &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; were earning only the standard $300 per day for the two-week gig and working in that confining outfit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As a result of &quot;Dirty Diana,&quot; Dean said she&#39;s now reading movie scripts from independent producers (she wouldn&#39;t say who)--one about a funny girl, one about a wholesome girl and one about a . . . </span><span class="cs43C038A">sexy </span><span class="csD5D7D290">girl.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Video filmed at Long Beach, California &ndash; directed by Joe Pytka.</span></p></body>
