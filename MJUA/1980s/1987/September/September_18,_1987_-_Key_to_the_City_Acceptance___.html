It would be difficult to imagine a figure of less physical resemblance to Jackson than Dileo, 39. Portly, short and balding, the colorfully loquacious Dileo has become Jackson&rsquo;s most trusted confidant. Determined to erase unflattering descriptions of Dileo by the press, Jackson calls him &ldquo;my shield of armor, my other half. We dream together and achieve together.&rdquo; As for Bubbles, a 3&frac12;-year-old chimpanzee released from a cancer lab in 1985, he eats at the table with Jackson, mimics his master&rsquo;s moonwalk, plays hide-and-seek, plays dead, blows bubbles and joins in pillow fights. The Japanese find it all fascinating. When Bubbles arrived in Japan on a separate flight from Jackson&rsquo;s, he got a Very Important Chimp reception from 300 photographers. The Mayor of Osaka later entertained Michael and Bubbles at a formal tea ceremony. &ldquo;Bubbles is so popular here,&rdquo; says one Tokyo merchandiser, &ldquo;that if he announced he was doing a concert tour, he&rsquo;d sell out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On off days Jackson has ventured out to shop for clocks, Japanese art books and a colorful Oriental screen. He also plundered two of Japan&rsquo;s biggest toy stores: Dileo won&rsquo;t disclose what the singer purchased, but jokes, &ldquo;His hotel room is a mess. I told him it&rsquo;s starting to look like his room at home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If Jackson does at times resemble a child, it may be because he identifies so closely with children. Quietly he has given rafts of free concert tickets to handicapped youngsters, visited Japanese schools and sent condolences and $20,000 to the family of 5-year-old Yoshiaki Ogiwara, an Osaka boy who was kidnapped and murdered recently. At one concert he dedicated his tour to the boy, a gesture that brought tears to the eyes of adoring fans. &ldquo;People just don&rsquo;t have a realistic picture of who Michael is,&rdquo; says makeup artist Karen Faye. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s innocent and inspiring without being preachy&mdash;and a lot of fun to be around.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
