Aware that their fleeting brush with a legend is at hand, they murmur, &ldquo;Sugu, sugu!&rdquo; &ldquo;Soon, soon!&rdquo; The sight of two vans&mdash;one blue, one gold&mdash;swinging round a corner brings instant recognition, and the crowd erupts with a joyous roar. As the rockmobiles come slickly to a halt, a lithe young man steps out, and for a second the stadium lights reflect brilliantly off the extravagant silver buckles of his jacket. Then he disappears behind a door labeled, in light-blue letters, Mr. Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Backstage at this ninth Japanese concert of what is to be a yearlong world tour, Michael Jackson radiates energy: His arrival sends a jolt of pre-show electricity through the cast and crew members who had been lazily hanging out around his simply furnished dressing room. Jackson rolls his head to limber up; gazing in a full-length mirror, he flicks a speck of loose makeup off his cheek. His toned, 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; frame seems imposing, quite at odds with the waif like image he presents to photographers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a little worried about my voice getting thin,&rdquo; says Jackson in a voice stronger and more assured than the shy squeak of his rare public pronouncements. &ldquo;But so far things are going good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Out front, the stadium is a powder keg awaiting the match. Christened Typhoon Michael by the Japanese press, Jackson has taken the nation by storm. The 38,000 seats for tonight&rsquo;s concert sold out (at $40 per) weeks ago, and some fans desperate to hail the man they call My-ke-ru have paid scalpers $700 to get in. But here in his dressing room the rock phenomenon lingers over a cup of tea, calmly ignoring the gathering clamor from the arena and the rising nerves of his 15 backup musicians and dancers. A crew member recites a brief prayer, then Jackson huddles with his cast like a football quarterback. They clap their hands and stomp their feet. &ldquo;Whatever we play,&rdquo; yells Jackson, his smooth, sculpted features relaxing into an engaging grin, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got to be funky!&rdquo; A moment later, to a burst of bright lights and thunderous applause, they jog onstage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
