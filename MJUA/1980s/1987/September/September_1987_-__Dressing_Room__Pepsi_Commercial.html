There was no evidence ever of any wrongdoing and it was curious that there were these &lsquo;discoveries&rsquo; of child molestation twenty-five years after the fact, and only when great sums of money were in view. &nbsp;Jimmy&rsquo;s case had far passed the statute of limitations, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter to the greedy. &nbsp;In fact, Jimmy had testified in an earlier trial that nothing had ever happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are those that will always accuse Michael of strangeness but Michael recorded a song, THE PRICE OF FAME, that said it all.</span></p></body>
