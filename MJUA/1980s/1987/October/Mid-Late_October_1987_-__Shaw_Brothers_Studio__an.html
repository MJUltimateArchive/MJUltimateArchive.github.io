During the time Liza Wang had the privilege to represent TVB and award Michael Jackson with a TV trophy as a souvenir. Both of them sat on the throne to take pictures. Michael also wore an Chinese ancient costume. When the reporter asked Liza about it yesterday she stated that she previously said Hello and took photos with him. She felt that he was extremely talented in the music industry and his dancing was great. The photograph will be placed in her biography...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As well as Liza, Simon Yam also bumped into Michael Jackson during his visit at the Shaw Studios. Simon said &quot;In 1987 I was shooting TVB series &quot;The Book And Sword&quot;. I was quite shocked to see him. He was very curious about the Chinese costumes. During the time I was wearing a Chinese Emperor costume and he appeared to be very interested in it. He touched the material and touched my bald head. I also took pictures with him and got his autograph. I enlarged the photo and have kept it in the warehouse. Michael is very nice and didn&#39;t have a superstar attitude. He is one of my favorite singers. I often listen to his songs with my wife. Originally we bought tickets to watch his concert in England but now we haven&#39;t got that chance. It has made me realize people need to cherish and value the people around them&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
