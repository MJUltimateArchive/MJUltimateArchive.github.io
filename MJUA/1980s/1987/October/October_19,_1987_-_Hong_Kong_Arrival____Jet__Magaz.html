And &ldquo;the Michael mania&rdquo; that especially engulfed Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama resulted in the sale of 600,000 copies of Bad, Jackson&rsquo;s newest album, which the singer&rsquo;s manager, Frank Dileo, said has already sold 9 million worldwide. The phenomenal sales represent seven weeks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As he headed for Hong Kong to rest and relax before resuming his world tour with the next stop in Australia, Jackson took time out to savor his conquest of Japan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I loved the show a lot and thought the fans were great. I love them a lot,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;We expected them (Japanese fans) to be subdued because of their reputation. I was quite overwhelmed. I feel a great warmth for the Japanese people and I was just happy that I could be there&quot;, Jackson enthused.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The sensitive singer/songwriter tried to express that feeling by learning to speak a little Japanese. After opening a show with his upbeat hit, &ldquo;Wanna Be Startin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo;&rdquo;, Jackson would say in Japanese, &ldquo;Good evening! I Love you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although he found time to shop for books, antique clocks, records and jewelry, he also visited Tokyo Disneyland to view his movie, Captain EO. The mayor of Osaka presented him a key to the city and fans at each of his concert dates showered him with hundreds of gifts. They included music boxes, cameras, tape recorders, Japanese clothes and beautiful Japanese screens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/2116119/when-michael-jackson-rode-roller-coaster-ocean"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;South China Morning Post&rdquo; (October 20, 2017)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180330133148/http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/2116119/when-michael-jackson-rode-roller-coaster-ocean"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (Quotes and summary of original October 20, 1987 article)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael Jackson in Hongkong&rdquo;, ran the headline in the South China Morning Post on October 20, 1987, the American singer having arrived on a private visit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Reclusive pop star Michael Jackson jetted into Hongkong yesterday &ndash; and, in an attempt to shake off pursuing photographers, immediately joined the lunchtime scramble for a taxi outside Kai Tak airport.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When a photographer pushed his way into the front seat of Jackson&rsquo;s taxi, the star&rsquo;s lone minder, formally attired in the unlikely get-up of tails and a bow-tie, told the aggressive press pack, &ldquo;If you keep coming on like this, Michael will not come back to Hongkong again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The game was up the following day. &ldquo;Michael Jackson &lsquo;twin&rsquo; dupes press at air&shy;port,&rdquo; read the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Post</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rsquo;s headline. &ldquo;The Truth is out. Michael Jackson did fly into Hongkong from Tokyo on Monday afternoon &ndash; but it wasn&rsquo;t Michael Jackson who led reporters on a wild goose chase at Kai Tak airport.

She&rsquo;s Canadian singer Peggy Johnson.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the time of the deception, Dr Penguin had been wearing what the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Post</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> now referred to as the &ldquo;standard garb&rdquo; for a man in his line of business: &ldquo;his magician&rsquo;s top hat and tails, and a funny button reading &lsquo;just visiting this planet,&rsquo;&rdquo; but no one had twigged.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr Penguin said instructions for the ruse had come from Tokyo &ldquo;via a third part&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On October 24, under the headline &ldquo;Thriller ride for the real Jackson&rdquo;, the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Post</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> reported that the singer had visited Ocean Park, and, &ldquo;rode the dipper three times&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael just loved the roller coaster. He said it was better than the Colossus at Magic Mountain,&rdquo; said Dr Penguin, who accompa&shy;nied Jackson to the theme park. Penguin said the outing was, &ldquo;the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had; Michael is like a Pied Piper&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson left Hong Kong on November 11.
