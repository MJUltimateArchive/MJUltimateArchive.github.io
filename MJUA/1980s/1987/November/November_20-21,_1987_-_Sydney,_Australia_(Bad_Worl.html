I went to the front of the boat, where Michael was, and I thought we would go on deck, but Michael said: &#39;No, let&#39;s go down the stairs&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To my surprise, the stairs led to the men&#39;s restrooms, with two stalls and a urinal. Michael entered one of them, obviously looking for privacy, and said: &ldquo;Molly, why is the press so horrible to me? I have not done anything to them!&quot; And he burst into tears.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did not know what to do, just be there, thrown against the door trying to comfort him. At that time, one of the guests entered the bathroom. He stepped in front of me, said &#39;Hello Molly&#39;, and went to the potty, unzipped his pants and... Then he saw Michael inside the cubicle, crying in the seas. The poor man was stunned, not knowing what to do, and in the end he could not even pee. He mumbled something, closed the zipper and stumbled up the stairs. I was totally stunned at that moment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We went back up and, to my horror, everyone was watching us. &ldquo;I have not done anything!&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;I have not done anything to him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Trevor Nunn, theater director, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-jacksons-peter-pan-obsession-8xjj0nqfqkt"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Times&rdquo; (July 5, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200218185324/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/michael-jacksons-peter-pan-obsession-8xjj0nqfqkt"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://visualguidanceltd.blogspot.com/2009/07/michael-jackson-peter-pan-obsession.html"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200218185426/https://visualguidanceltd.blogspot.com/2009/07/michael-jackson-peter-pan-obsession.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back in 1987, my legal representative in London was contacted by a man claiming to represent Michael Jackson. He wanted to know my movements over the coming months so that, given Michael&rsquo;s global itinerary, we might set a time and a place somewhere in the world when he and I might meet. &ldquo;Meet about what?&rdquo; asked my flabbergasted lawyer. He was told that &ldquo;Michael&rdquo; wanted to talk about staging a new and different touring show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When this was relayed to me, I strongly suspected the hand of Ken Campbell, the comedian,, who had &ldquo;done me&rdquo; once before. It had to be a hoax.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two days later my lawyer had a more insistent call from someone purporting to be Michael Jackson&rsquo;s manager, a Frank DiLeo, who reeled off a touring schedule that seemed to be going everywhere except the UK. Surely he must be bona fide? The manager mentioned that Michael was &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of my staging of a crazy experimental musical enterprise called Starlight Express and wanted to &ldquo;share ideas&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was scheduled to be in Sydney rehearsing a new production of Les Mis&eacute;rables at the same time that the superstar was doing some concerts there at the Parramatta stadium. &ldquo;So we could meet in Sydney then,&rdquo; I said, still convinced Ken would be gleeful that I was falling for one of his setups yet again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just before I left for Australia, the late Bill Fournier, my lawyer, asked me if he could tell the Jackson management the name of my Sydney hotel. Despite my cries that this was proof positive a prank was under way, Bill insisted these approaches were genuine. &ldquo;But why do they want the name of my hotel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Bill, in all solemnity, &ldquo;Michael Jackson says he wants to stay in the same place as you so you can meet up a few times while he&rsquo;s in Australia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several days after I arrived at the Regent hotel, overlooking Sydney harbour bridge, I heard two assistant managers excitedly confirming that Jackson&rsquo;s entourage had booked the entire top two floors of this 30-storey building. Curiouser and curiouser. Eventually, towards the end of my Les Mis&eacute;rables rehearsals, the Jackson circus arrived and soon after that, still with Bill as the go-between, a meeting time was arranged.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Getting into the Jackson apartment, even by invitation, resembled a heist at the Bank of England. Each stage of my progress involved being questioned by countless people and being asked countless times for my &ldquo;picture ID&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As all was duly confirmed by walkie-talkie, I inched closer to the presence: from the penultimate floor to the top floor, to the adjacent corridor, to the door of the apartment, to a small vestibule inside and finally to a vast and empty lounge with almost floor-to-ceiling windows and one of the most breathtaking views in the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Occasionally, figures clad entirely in white moved noiselessly in soft white slippers through the apartment. It felt like keeping vigil at an intensive care unit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The silence was total.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, dressed in red velvet trousers and a red shirt, his face unexpectedly pale and with a hint of cosmetics on his lips, there he was. The king of pop was shaking my hand, thanking me profoundly for &ldquo;sparing time&rdquo; to see him, attentive to my every need, as coffee and delicacies arrived in a whirl of white pyjamas. Something about the way he walked &mdash; a high instep, or a slight flat-footedness, something less lithe than I had been expecting &mdash; prompted my last vestige of misgiving, a suspicion that I was with a brilliant impersonator of the world&rsquo;s single most famous man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He sat a few feet away from me and as our conversation got rather stutteringly under way, I found myself noticing what seemed to be faint discolorations of skin grafting on his face, the brilliance of his eyes, which at reflective moments seemed to well up with sadness, and the soft girlishness of his voice, especially in laughter. I didn&rsquo;t really know who to &ldquo;be&rdquo;, as the unreality of this encounter gave way to the rational conclusion that it was actually happening: I was watching me at the same time as being me. Should I be an awestruck fan, or somebody from the music business who could share a bit of his vocabulary, or a wise elder bringing cool assessment from a different discipline?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I suppose I tried all three, as we talked about the new album, Bad, the rigours of being on tour, the rehearsal regime for his breakthrough choreography and the opportunity for the creation of something completely original.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In response to his questions, I told him things about Cats and Starlight Express, shows I had directed with the intention of finding more environmental, inclusive ways of presenting music theatre. In return, Michael told me how he yearned to be able to do something more spectacular, such as flying over the audience. &ldquo;Oh, I know just how to do that, no problem,&rdquo; I said banteringly. &ldquo;I had people flying over the audience when I did Peter Pan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">	</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Something seismic had happened. He reacted as if an electric current had just passed through him. He sat up to the edge of his chair, clutching the arms with splayed hands, one of which was gloved. &ldquo;You did Peter Pan?&rdquo; he whispered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yeah, in London,&rdquo; I said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He leapt up. &ldquo;You directed Peter Pan?&rdquo; The high-pitched voice went higher as he walked up and down in front of me, repeating: &ldquo;Oh my God. Peter Pan! I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I described our production, in which all the children&rsquo;s parts had been played by adult actors. He bounded across the room, his eyes full of tears, he knelt down in front of me, his hands on my knees, and he said: &ldquo;Could I play Peter, is it too late? Will you let me play Peter? All I ever want to do is to play Peter Pan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From that point on I was his new best friend. White-clad figures hovered in doorways, worried that the yells, squawks and squeals of unbridled delight might be the sounds of their lord and master being beaten up by his unknown visitor. He knew every incident in the Peter Pan story, he recited lines from the text and he became immensely vulnerable and childlike as the delight transformed him to some earlier moment in his life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The unexpectedness of this convulsion, in which I had suddenly become the possible enabler of his greatest yearning, prevented me from reflecting on what it meant or what condition it revealed; but I think I realised something about his life as a child star and his eccentric discomfort with being grown up was being shown and this revelation was very private and very rare.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The meeting finished after two hours, but not before he had made me &ldquo;promise&rdquo; to go to his concert the following night. I was scheduled to be in the garage below the hotel at 5.30 in the evening. I arrived through a similar cordon of security and then discovered to my disbelief that I was being ushered into a Dormobile vehicle with black glass windows, containing a driver, two security men and . . . Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I travelled with him to the stadium and had the unprecedented and unrepeatable experience of being invisible in the dark interior, as totally visible hordes of fans screamed adoration and reached out to touch the glass as we passed. I was taken backstage with him briefly, before following an escort to my place beside the sound operator at a massive desk in the best position in the entire auditorium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was under strict instructions. During the journey there, Michael had said in a number of different ways that I was to tell him everything I didn&rsquo;t like about the staging and what he was doing. When I responded that I was sure there would be nothing I didn&rsquo;t like, he became urgent and insistent: &ldquo;No, you must tell me . . . I need somebody to tell me . . . think of how it could be different . . . think of how I could fly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was, of course, astonishing &mdash; incomparable as a dancer, with the music seeming to come not just from his mouth but from his entire supercharged body. I allowed myself to note that the show was very unstructured, that there was insufficient contrast and that a hint of a narrative might allow more of his fascination as &ldquo;a character&rdquo; to emerge.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the thunderous finale, I was ushered backstage again and into the vehicle, soon after to be joined by an utterly drained, almost lifeless Michael and a short, sturdy, middle-aged man with a greying ponytail, Mr DiLeo. I tried to tell Michael how miraculous he had just been, but all he would say was: &ldquo;I want to know what you really think. Not now. Tell me tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back at the hotel, his manager confirmed there could be no more talk until Michael had slept for 12 hours. I was instructed to show up at the hotel room the following day at noon. By then I had worked out a proposal that would indeed have a hint of narrative, structured round the song Man in the Mirror, allowing him to become two versions of the same person, one a full-on, sexual animal as in Bad, the other a more sensitive, tender, innocent creature of imagination, one who, at the show&rsquo;s climax, would fly up and away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael came in again at exactly the appointed hour, he was with Mr DiLeo. This made things twice as difficult, for although Michael remained rapt and enthusiastic, almost too impressionably saying, &ldquo;Oh, I love that&rdquo; and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful&rdquo;, his manager was altogether more businesslike, asking for detail in questions such as, &ldquo;Exactly how would you do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had the distinct impression that Michael saw us as two children in the presence of an adult and was urging me to ignore this parental control. He raced on to future plans. He urged me to return to England via Los Angeles, so we could meet and talk more. He insisted he could switch his rehearsal plans to New York to coincide with my next obligation, which was rehearsing a Broadway musical. I was given telephone numbers to make contact in Los Angeles and New York.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael agreed to pose for a photograph with my little daughter if I fetched her from my room. That photograph is the only real evidence I have that any of this is true. However many times I called, I never got through to Michael again and I couldn&rsquo;t entirely rid myself of the idea that people in the organisation were under instruction, very politely, to keep me away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But here&rsquo;s the point. I wasn&rsquo;t the least surprised to hear that Michael Jackson had made a huge children&rsquo;s playground at a ranch that he had called Neverland, the name of the home of his beloved Peter Pan. When the accusations of sexual molestation of children appeared, I believed then, as I believe now, that they were untrue. Call me naive, but I am convinced he was being Peter Pan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Peter presides over a group of Lost Boys, children who look to his leadership but who he needs as much as they need him. The Lost Boys live in the same big room as Peter and they all sleep in the same big bed. Inviting boys to Neverland, staying in the same room, all sleeping in the same huge bed . . . these are the activities that were at the centre of the abuse allegations. But Peter is almost androgynous, he is sexless, he is adored by Wendy but has no concept of the love she wants from him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;What I witnessed of [Michael&rsquo;s] obsession with Peter Pan was different, unfakeable and real. It was not really about a part he wanted to play. It was about the person he wanted to be.</span></p></body>
