I was playing the bongos at three, and was touring, singing, and dancing at five.&quot; He still remembers the first thing he sang in kindergarten class. &quot;It was &#39;Climb Every Mountain&#39;. Everyone got excited!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The brothers, who called themselves The Jackson Five, entered loads of talent contests. &quot;We won every one of them and out house was [illegible] with trophies. When we first became superstars, I just thought it was brilliant.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time Michael was 12, he was getting 1000 fan letters a week, his first solo records were all massive hits and he became a millionaire. Fame gradually turned him into a recluse--&quot;My idea of your average person is someone in a crowd who&#39;s running towards me, trying to tear my clothes off&quot;--but he was addicted to performing and being on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love the magic that comes from facing an audience. I&#39;m a stage addict. When I&#39;m not on it on it for a long time, I have fits and act crazy. It&#39;s like a part of me is missing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He reckons that being on stage is the only time he really opens up. [Illegible]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;[Dancing is] the most wonderful thing of all time, because people communicated through bodily movement before anything.&quot;...&quot;[For Sunday fasting,] I don&#39;t eat anything. I just drink fruit juice, it&#39;s a great feeling.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;People should [illegible] them out of their systems. It help keep you strong. All those impurities come out of you because you&#39;re not [illegible]. It comes out in the form of pimples, or [illegible], or big pores.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael had to give away his pet boa constrictor Muscles, even though he thinks &quot;snakes are sweet misunderstood creatures.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;I&#39;m more at home with platonic relationships&quot;, he claims.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is devoutly religious, and likes to keep himself under control--&quot;I don&#39;t want to lose sight of who I am.&quot; With that in mind, he doesn&#39;t touch drink or drugs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;m not like a lot of people, who make money and lose themselves in drink and drugs and start saying, &quot;Who am I?&quot; and end up broken.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He claims that he&#39;s no angel, &quot;but I&#39;ve never in my life smoked marijuana and I don&#39;t want to try it. I&#39;ve been offered it, but I&#39;m not interested.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Other things Michael would like to do include: &quot;Being able to touch the truth inside a person--that&#39;s what a performer should be able to do. It&#39;s like a great [illegible]--it can bring you to tears, it can touch you so much.&quot; And he&#39;s committed to &quot;a world where Mankind knows no suffering.&quot; He gives generously to charity. He&#39;d also like to live for a very long time. That&#39;s why he sleeps in the famous oxygen tent. &quot;When I awake, I feel like a new person!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The much-touted Peter Pan film that Steven Spielberg was planning with Michael is never far from his thoughts. &quot;There are pictures of Peter Pan all over the walls in my room&quot;, he says wistfully. I totally identify with that little lost boy who had eternal youth.&quot;</span></p></body>
