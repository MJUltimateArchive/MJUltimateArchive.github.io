We had spaghetti and pizza and garlic bread and salad, and he had that too.&quot; She toured the house, which is described by another visitor as being in good taste despite its Louis XV style and the extravagances of its trophy room, screening room, private zoo, Disney memorabilia and much-publicized candy store. The latter feature was what most impressed Finmark, who watched the movie &quot;Short Circuit&quot; with Jackson and was introduced to his animals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t like it when other kids say he&#39;s weird and call him names or I read those stories about him,&quot; the outspoken child says. &quot;That&#39;s his life and his choice, and he should be allowed to do with it as he wants.&quot;</span></p></body>
