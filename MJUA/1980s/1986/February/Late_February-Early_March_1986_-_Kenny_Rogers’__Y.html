I had heard about his chimpanzee, Bubbles, and we did a shot with the chimp. Later on, Michael and I did another session alone, at his request. That was the start. Michael Jackson&rsquo;s agreeing to be part of the book was, in fact, the jumping off point for the whole project. Michael Jackson is unique, both as an individual and as a performer. Yet, while I&rsquo;d been around him many times, I never honestly felt I knew him until we spent a day together in the photography studio... I told him of my ideas for this book and asked him to bring his chimp, Bubbles. There were maybe twenty-five people in the studio that day, and the chimp was the center of attention. That meant the focus was off Michael, and I think the relative anonymity gave him a chance to relax. And Bubbles was so human it was almost frightening. He would take Christopher by the hand, walk over to the refrigerator, open it, take out a banana, and hand it to him. Christopher was amazed &ndash; we all were. The session was the first time I&rsquo;d had the chance to be one on one with Michael. It means a lot to me to be able to say that not only do I love his music, but I also like him very much as a person and consider him a friend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/25/lkl.02.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Larry King Live&rdquo; (June 25, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190411213807/http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/25/lkl.02.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did a book called &quot;Your Friends and Mine.&quot; It&#39;s a photography book.

He stayed there and wanted to chat and talk. And we took pictures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think I took the first picture of him with his head off. Because he said, I want to see what this looks like. So — it&#39;s just — he was just such a special guy. You know? And you don&#39;t meet guys who have that kind of success that really are able to communicate at a different level. And that&#39;s a success I would not wish on anybody.</span></p></body>
