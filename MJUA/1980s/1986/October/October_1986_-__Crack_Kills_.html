He has on &rsquo;50s-style dark shades, a brown fedora, and his long jeri-curled hair is pulled back and tied into a ponytail. A chimpanzee dressed in overalls sits on his shoulder one minute, in his lap the next.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At one end of the studio, a spread of fried chicken, potato salad, greens, and cole slaw has been arranged. The key men are present: Quincy Jones, who is sitting on the floor, making notes between spoonfuls of soul food; Bruce, the walrus-mustached engineer; and Frank DiLeo, who sits back in the control room sending long streams of cigar smoke curling toward the ceiling. They&rsquo;re taking a break before Run-DMC come in to collaborate on an anti-crack song. Michael sits on a piano stool and says little...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Run-DMC come swaggering into the studio dressed all in black &mdash; black hats, black shirts, black pants &mdash; except for their white Adidas and inch-thick gold braids hanging around their necks. &ldquo;Yo, what up, Q?&rdquo; they shout to Quincy as they invade the room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones embraces them and introduces Michael. They seem taken aback by his shy, quiet presence, as if they thought the real Michael Jackson would be different. Seconds tick by, punctuated by silence. The rappers turn away at last and start jiving noisily with each other. And Michael drifts through his own calm, through some serene place where he lives most of the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The meeting unsettles Run-DMC. They can&rsquo;t seem to get on track with the anti-crack rap &mdash; something, according to Jones, is missing from their lyrics. He tells them to try to rap with more sophistication &mdash; metaphorically, symbolically. They work on it again but can&rsquo;t get anything together before they have to leave. Michael puts on his headphones and slips quietly into the recording booth&rsquo;s single spotlight. He will be here until it all comes together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Quincy Jones, album producer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808112724/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/graffiti.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Graffiti&rdquo; magazine (November 1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It didn&#39;t work. Run-D.M.C. tried rapping over the top, but Michael couldn&#39;t relate to the sound, so he took it home and put it in the spare guest room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jospeh &ldquo;Run&rdquo; Simmons, Run-DMC member, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105404/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/badnew3.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Run DMC have been talking of collaboration with MJ on an anti-crack song (to deal with the rising consumption in New York of the cheap cocaine-based drug).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Recently Run went to meet Michael at his home in Hollywood. Says Run, who originally voiced doubts about working with the &quot;kooky&quot; superstar: &quot;He&#39;s an incredible human being. The best man in the world. We ate soul food at his house and it seemed like he was in touch with God. When the fried chicken came, I knew he was cool.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;People say he&#39;s gay and stuff... I don&#39;t believe that. In the middle of the evening, I thought, &#39;Gee, I&#39;m sitting next to a superstar&#39;, and then I realized he&#39;s just normal, eating his rice and playing with my gold sneaker (pendant).&quot;</span></p></body>
