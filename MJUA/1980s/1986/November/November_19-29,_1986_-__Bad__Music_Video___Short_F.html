Filming near condemned Harlem buildings, Scorsese paired Jackson with a young Wesley Snipes for a dramatic black-and-white confrontation &ndash; then the video&#39;s second act bursts to life with a </span><span class="cs43C038A">West Side Story</span><span class="csD5D7D290">-style combat dance staged in a Brooklyn subway station. &quot;We went over schedule; it was two and a half weeks of the dance sequence alone,&quot; said Scorsese. &quot;I was mesmerized by it. The video monitor made us all dancers.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I remember meeting him at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. He was very quiet. The first thing he asked me was, &lsquo;Do you know about Michelangelo?&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; And we started talking about Michelangelo. He&rsquo;d just discovered his paintings &ndash; the Sistine Chapel and the sculptures. He was taken by all of that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was a different form for me. The big issue really was the temptation to do this really major dance piece with camera moves and cutting which we had planned on page based on his choreography. And working with Michael Chapman, who choreographed the fight scenes in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Raging Bull</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Shooting the big dance scene was the allure of it. Michael was never a person who was overly enthusiastic. He was quiet. Accepting. How should I put it? He was very precise about what he wanted in the choreography. He was concerned, like with any great dancer, they like to be seen full figure. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case because I&rsquo;d planned other things. The use of close-ups, and tracking him. Eventually he understood that. There was never any resistance, but questions. He was open to everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The most interesting thing about it, is when we cast the picture, Wesley was the man. Michael went through those scenes in the film and he was toe-to-toe with every one of those actors. It was quite moving and powerful performance I thought. Like that scene in the hallway. We did that maybe 40 times. He stood up to Wesley, and Wesley is a wonderful actor. Formidable. Strong presence. And Michael did it. It was quite something.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We shot it in Harlem, and when he goes home to his apartment, he was very quiet looking around. The apartment was quite nice, actually. But it was in Harlem. Across the street the buildings were torn down or condemned. He took me aside, &lsquo;Do people </span><span class="cs43C038A">live</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> here?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Well, yes, this is actually a well-done apartment!&rsquo;...I think he was overwhelmed by what he saw&hellip;These tenements had, when you come in the front hall, there&rsquo;s an apartment in the back on the ground floor. There was an unfortunate person in there, in bed pretty much, coughing and seemed like on his last days. Michael said, &lsquo;Do you see what&rsquo;s in there?&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;Yeah, I know.&rsquo; He was in the place and it worked for him. It worked for him as a performance, but his compassion for the people came through. It was very moving.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was very sweet. He came to our apartment. My mother cooked dinner. He was very easy to be with. There was a genuine sweetness about him. And treating everybody the same way. Didn&rsquo;t matter who it was &mdash; my family, the crew. The only time he expressed [a production demand], and again it was out of compassion &mdash; the older man is getting mugged and gets pushed at one point. And we did it a couple of takes and he was nervous about that. He didn&rsquo;t want anyone to get hurt. We didn&rsquo;t know if we had it on film and we said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s do it again.&rsquo; And he </span><span class="cs43C038A">begged</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> me not to do it again. He said, &#39;Please, this shouldn&rsquo;t be violent.&#39; So I didn&rsquo;t do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Wesley Snipes, actor, &ldquo;The Tonight Show&rdquo; (September 17, 2015) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wesley-snipes-talks-being-michael-jacksons-bodyguard-for-bad-video-85611/"><span class="cs8567212B">summary/quotes</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I auditioned for Scorsese and Q &ndash; Quincy Jones &ndash; and they selected me out of, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe hundreds of guys who auditioned,&rdquo; Snipes says in the clip. After Fallon asks about his impressions of Jackson, Snipes tells the hilarious story &ndash; earning uproarious laughs from Questlove and the Roots.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The great Michael: the inspiration, the muse,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Michael was very interesting &ndash; very, very interesting. He actually was a little nervous filming in Harlem because we filmed some of the &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; video there in Harlem &hellip; He was a little nervous because the fans were a little ambivalent with him. Some of them loved him. Some of them hated him. So you hear them literally yelling out, &lsquo;Michael Jackson! We love you! Oh my God &ndash; I want to have your baby.&rsquo; And you have other people going, &lsquo;You ain&rsquo;t bleep! Michael Jackson, you ain&rsquo;t never coming back to the &lsquo;hood! Michael Jackson, what you do for us?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;So Michael turned to me and was like, &lsquo;Are you scared?&#39;&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;Yo, Mike, what are you talking about?&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you scared? Really, are you scared?&rsquo; I was like, &lsquo;No, Mike, this is Harlem, baby! This is where we grew up. They love you. Really, you&rsquo;re scared?&rsquo; He was like, &lsquo;A little.&#39;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Snipes jokes that he was &ldquo;demoted&rdquo; from actor to &ldquo;bodyguard.&rdquo; But he says the unorthodox gig was worth it: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do it again any time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;He was such an inspiration, such a wonderful talent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/Y2laZhLjcWU"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Conan&rdquo; (August 9, 2017)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wesley Snipes remembered battling Prince during auditions for a key role in Michael Jackson&lsquo;s 18-minute &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; short-film on Conan on Wednesday. Snipes ultimately won the part, landing one of his first major on-screen looks before he exploded as a movie superstar in the Nineties.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Me and Prince were auditioning together, and I blew Prince out of the water,&rdquo; Snipes declared. &ldquo;Michael had told Prince that he had the role, and then he met me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;This is a true story,&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;Prince was actually considered the lead character in the &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; video, and then Michael met me and kicked Prince to the curb.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a VH1 interview with Chris Rock in 1997, Prince offered a different reason for not appearing in the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; video: He said he turned down the role because he wasn&rsquo;t comfortable being the object of the single&rsquo;s sensual first line, &ldquo;Your butt is mine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; clip, directed by Martin Scorsese, is an 18-minute story revolving around inner-city gangs, and Snipes said part of the reason he got the role was that Jackson believed he was actually a gang member in real life. &ldquo;[Jackson] really thought I was in a gang &ndash; he didn&rsquo;t know that I was a trained thespian,&rdquo; the actor recalled. &ldquo;At the time, the great Michael hadn&rsquo;t spent very much time in the &lsquo;hood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/is-michael-jackson-for-real-19870924"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (September 24, 1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three weeks prior to the release of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Quincy Jones is recalling this scene from his bed in L.A.&#39;s Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he is soon to undergo oral surgery. Tonight the fifty-four-year-old veteran producer of such luminaries as Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and Count Basie is recalling the recording of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> in his inimitable hipster voice while viewing a rough edit of the &quot;Bad&quot; video on a TV across the room. On the screen Michael is sizzling through a highly stylized dance number like a young incarnation of James Brown.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As soon as he heard &quot;Bad,&quot; Jones thought of getting his friend Martin Scorsese to direct the video. But Michael was unfamiliar with Scorsese&#39;s work, having only seen </span><span class="cs43C038A">New York, New York,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and wanted George Lucas or Steven Spielberg. But the image-savvy Dileo pushed Scorsese, knowing that a glossy Spielberg-type fantasy would merely cement further Michael&#39;s problematic Peter Pan-sy image.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to a close friend of Scorsese&#39;s, the filming of &quot;Bad,&quot; which kept Michael out of the studio for six weeks last fall, was &quot;a nightmare.&quot; Michael insisted the director &quot;reshoot and reshoot.&quot; Scorsese describes his star as &quot;a perfectionist&quot; and says that because of Michael (who was also footing the bill), the video went &quot;two or three times over budget,&quot; costing about $2 million. Still, the director found Michael &quot;sympathetic and sweet and open.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &quot;Bad&quot; script, written by novelist Richard Price, was inspired by the true story of a Harlem youth named Edmund Perry who went to prep school at Phillips Exeter. The subject of the recent book </span><span class="cs43C038A">Best Intentions,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> by Robert Sam Anson, Perry was shot to death two years ago by a New York plainclothes policeman who claimed Perry had tried to mug him. The video romanticizes things somewhat, allowing Michael&#39;s character to dance his way out of the situation, though the ending is ambiguous. &quot;Bad&quot; &ndash; a stunning minimovie that enhances the lyrically vague song with vivid images &ndash; could help </span><span class="cs43C038A">Bad</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> beat the follow-up jinx.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csE52E8F9B">Album Cover Shoot</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/is-michael-jackson-for-real-19870924"><span class="cs8567212B">Rolling Stone (September 24, 1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, back in the real world, the proposed cover portrait was causing a commotion.

So when I found out that most of Michael&#39;s video would be dancing and I&#39;d be able to move the camera and have some fun with him, I agreed to do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ever since &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, which captured the mood of a concert the way no other film has before or since, Scorsese has been offered, and turned down, a lot of video projects. &quot;He just caught me at the right time&quot;, he shrugs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;All I know is that we had to hurry up and shoot it, and now it&#39;s not coming out&quot;, jokes Scorsese.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808110939/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/baddestvideo.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Right On! Focus&quot; magazine (1987)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson magic has touched a lot of people. When it was time to do the video for his new record, some very lucky young actors, one in particular, was touched by Michael&rsquo;s magic. &ldquo;I am not going to lie. It was the most exciting time in my life. Here I was, Sam Bono, working with Michael Jackson. It was really a dream come true&rdquo;, Sam told us in an exclusive interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">New York actor / model Sam Bono grew up listening to the music of the Jacksons. Sam confessed that he had often dreamed of sharing the stage with his favorite group and to have a small part in the Jackson video was a perfect Christmas gift. &ldquo;It was hard to believe&rdquo; &ndash; he said, sharing his initial reaction. &ldquo;I got a call from my casting agent. He asked me if I would be available for the next two weeks. Being the unemployed actor that I am most of the time, naturally I sad &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. He then told me &ldquo;Michael Jackson is in town doing a video, would you be available to work on it?&quot; I jokingly said, &ldquo;Let me check my calendar.&rdquo; Then I screamed &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next, Sam told about the audition. &ldquo;I went in to read for the casting person. He liked me and asked me to return the next day. That&rsquo;s when I read for Martin Scorsese. He liked me. In a few days, I got a call saying that I had this small part. I flipped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The video for the song &quot;Bad&quot; is loosely based on a true story from the pages of a newspaper. Michael plays a youngster named Darryl. He is an inner city kid that attends a mostly white prep school. They shot these scenes at the Master&rsquo;s School in Dobbs Ferry, New York. Bono has vivid memories of his days of shooting his scenes. &ldquo;I woke up, looked in the mirror, and said, &#39;Bono and Jackson. Well, this is the day.&#39; I was so excited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sam said that he ran to meet the bus that took him to the the set. He said that he just stared out of the window all the way to the school. He was wondering what the day was going to be like. He said that when they finally arrived, there were enough trucks, cameras, and crew for a major motion picture. Sam and a number of other actors were taken into a classroom where they awaited Jackson&rsquo;s arrival. Bono recalls, &ldquo;We waited about an hour, then Michael&rsquo;s limo arrived. I saw him get out with the mask on. But that was the only time that he wore it, and I think that was only because of the photographers that were there. He walked into the classroom with his security guard and two local policemen. There was total silence in the room. You could have heard a pin drop. Michael didn&rsquo;t say much; he just looked around, then took a seat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sam said that Michael appeared to be very shy and avoided eye contact with anyone other than his staff. Sam said that Michael was nice and friendly, but quiet. The producer, Quincy Jones, had rented a commuter train to shoot some of the scenes in. That is where Sam says that he got to know the real Michael. &ldquo;In the classroom, Michael would do his scenes, then go back into his trailer. However, when we were doing the train scenes, there was no trailer for him to get into. And none of his security or other staff could be around, which is what I liked. They were not allowed in the car, because we were filming and they would have been seen on film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That is when I really got to know him&rdquo;, Sam offered. &ldquo;It was just us, the camera and the director. That is when he opened up. He let loose. We talked about everything from the weather to his &#39;Thriller&#39; video. He was like a regular guy and he was very professional.&rdquo; Sam said that after seeing Michael smothered by his staff, it was good to see Michael left alone and allowed to be himself. Mike told Sam that he really got a charge out of doing the &quot;Thriller&quot; video. It seems that the monsters gave him a real thrill.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bono said that he and Michael talked about girls and family. Sam got a surprise reaction to the Mary Wilson book. He recalls, &ldquo;Being that we were on the train for 5 hours and we spent a lot of time waiting, I pulled a book out of my bag. It was the new Mary Wilson book, &lsquo;Dreamgirl&rsquo;. I asked Michael if he would write something in the book for me. When I handed the book to him, he looked almost shocked. Michael said, &ldquo;Are you reading this book?&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;Yes, have you read it?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t read this book, Mary is so jealous of Diana. You should have seen her at the Motown 25th special...&#39; He just went on and on recounting, as if I was there&rdquo;, Sam recalls. &quot;So, I jokingly said to him that I knew just what he was talking about, &#39;I spoke to Diana last night. She said to tell you, &quot;Hi&quot;&#39;... and we both laughed about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sam said that Michael spoke with pride about the new album. Sam said that there is no doubt in his mind that Michael is a genius. He said that Michael spent most of his free time composing songs in his head. Bono remembered, &ldquo;Between takes, you would bear this incredible singing and humming. Michael would be running these tunes off the top of his head. They were good enough to be pressed into records. Everything that comes out of that kid&rsquo;s mouth is golden&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The cast and crew rode the commuter train for five hours, back and forth, shooting over and over again. When the director finally said that it was a wrap, the train started back toward the school. Michael spotted the conductor. Sam continues, &ldquo;Michael asked him, &#39;Could you show me how the train works?&#39; The conductor was more than thrilled to take him by the hand and walk him up to the front of the car. He took Michael into the cabin and showed him all the controls. Michael seemed fascinated. The guy let Michael take control of the train. We started going slow, then we jerked. I yelled out to the others, &#39;Michael is driving the train.&#39; &nbsp;An older lady yelled out, &#39;Oh my God&#39;, but everyone else was amused. I told Michael, &#39;Go for it, Mike, give it some more power.&#39; The conductor showed Michael the horn, and he just laid on it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The word had gotten out that Michael Jackson was around and fans were all over the train station. As Michael pulled the train into the station, he could see all the fans with his pictures, posters, buttons, and albums. You can&rsquo;t imagine the amazement in one boy&rsquo;s eyes as he jumped up and down, screaming, &ldquo;Mommy, Mommy, look, Michael Jackson is driving the train.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael originally wanted Steven Spielberg to shoot the video for &lsquo;Bad&rsquo;. However, with Spielberg committed to several other projects, Quincy Jones suggested Martin Scorsese.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Short film was written by Richard Price, writer of such works as The Wanderers and Blood Brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ex Shalamar star Jeffrey Daniels worked on choreography and also appeared in the final dance scenes. He said Michael was looking for a contemporary version of West Side Story for the underground scene, which was shot in the Hoyt Schermerhorn Station in Brooklyn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The opening black &amp; white School scenes were shot at the Master&rsquo;s School in Dobbs Ferry, New York.
