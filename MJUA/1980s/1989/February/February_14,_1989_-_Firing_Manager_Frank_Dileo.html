The move comes just a month after Jackson&rsquo;s pop rival, Prince, severed his ties with his longtime management team.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s personal publicist, Lee Solters, issued a terse statement Tuesday saying: &ldquo;Michael Jackson and Frank Dileo have announced an amicable parting. Jackson said, &lsquo;I thank Frank for his contribution on my behalf during the past several years.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dileo, who had been Jackson&rsquo;s manager for the last five years, was at Duke University at a weight-reduction center and unavailable for comment. Jackson and his attorney, John Branca, refused to comment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, industry insiders were surprised by the unexpected move, which came just weeks after Dileo announced that Jackson&rsquo;s Jan. 27 Sports Arena date would be his farewell to concert touring.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While the Jackson camp termed the parting &ldquo;amicable,&rdquo; industry observers speculated that Dileo&rsquo;s sudden departure signaled a falling out between the portly, cigar-smoking manager and his eccentric superstar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As recently as three weeks ago, Dileo told The Times: &ldquo;Michael and I go out together a lot at night. We go to record and clothing stores on Ventura Boulevard, goofing around. We ride around looking at the sights. We have a ball.&rdquo; Dileo added that he had even prepared a guest room for Jackson in his new Ojai home &ldquo;because he spends a lot of time at my house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So why the sudden departure? &ldquo;It may sound a little harsh, but Frank&rsquo;s usefulness to Michael was probably over,&rdquo; said a key industry player who insisted on anonymity. &ldquo;If Michael is giving up concerts and aiming more for movies, Frank was no longer so necessary. Dileo is a great record man, but movies aren&rsquo;t his area of expertise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A former Jackson associate added: &ldquo;I think Michael became a little disenchanted when it became obvious that &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t going to outsell &lsquo;Thriller,&rsquo; or even become the No. 2 album of all time. There&rsquo;s also been a lot of infighting between different factions in Michael&rsquo;s camp during the past year--and Frank obviously lost.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t help that Frank had such a high media profile. He may have taken one too many bows.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank Dileo, manager, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13015497/hit-man"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Nashville Scene&rdquo; (November 22, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826212831/https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13015497/hit-man"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dileo harbors no ill will toward Jackson over his firing in February 1989. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame it ended,&rdquo; Dileo says. &ldquo;I really like Michael. It ended for a lot of reasons. First of all, Michael and I spent every day together for five-and-a-half years. A lot of people were jealous of that. And at that point in time, we had a lot of power between us. There was one or two record executives, and a lawyer, possibly two lawyers, that sort of needed me to get out of the way, so that they had more control with Michael. And it also was a way for them to get rid of Yetnikoff, who had a lot of power and was my friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine why a bunch of industry suits wanted to get their hands on Jackson. But how was Jackson convinced? &ldquo;Unfortunately, they talked Michael into it,&rdquo; Dileo says, &ldquo;by promising him&mdash;now this is according to Michael, and I believe this&mdash;by promising him that if he fired me and hired Sandy Gallin, that he&rsquo;d be able to make movies in Hollywood. Now the truth be told, Michael never made a movie. The only movie [besides 1978&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Wiz</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] he&rsquo;s ever made was with me, and that was </span><span class="cs43C038A">Moonwalker</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
