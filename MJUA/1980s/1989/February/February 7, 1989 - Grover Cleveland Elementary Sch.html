Inside, he spoke with many of the school&#39;s more than 900 pupils and handed out gifts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s assistants said his visit to the school was his way of showing concern about the impact of the playground massacre upon its students, many of them Southeast Asian refugees.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Twenty-nine children and a teacher were wounded and five youngsters, aged 6 to 9, were killed by bullets from a magazine-fed AKM-47 assault rifle fired on the playground by Patrick Purdy, who then took his own life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some 50 police officers tried to control the crowd of people - children as well as adults -- who flocked to see Jackson. The excited throng was unruly enough that school administrators had to appeal for quiet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also planned a visit to a nearby hospital where some of the wounded children were recovering.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Having someone like this come and visit them will be remembered for a long time,&#39; said Dr. Patricia Dixon, a hospital pediatrician.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Stockton City Council approved an ordinance Monday night to ban a variety of semiautomatic weapons in the city. A court challenge is likely, however, since less restrictive state law may take precedence.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Diane Batres, head of District Attorney&#39;s Victim Witness department, &ldquo;KXTV&rdquo; (June 26, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110223210141/http://www.news10.net/news/featured/story.aspx?storyid=62018&amp;catid=49"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diane Batres wasn&#39;t happy back in 1989 when she took a call from someone at MJJ Productions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I thought it was someone wanting to make a movie. I was furious,&quot; said Batres.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Cleveland School shootings had happened a couple weeks before -- and Batres was in charge of the District Attorney&#39;s Victim Witness department. Then she learned MJJ was Michael Jackson, offering a Stockton visit to comfort survivors of the school attack.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was very kind of him to do this. He brought truckloads of gifts to the children and held children in his arms. He was genuinely concerned and expressed his sorrow,&quot; said Batres.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson gave videotapes of his recent recordings to the children. One of the songs was &#39;Man in the Mirror.&#39; Batres heard later from a grateful parent how much that meant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One of the mothers called after the experience and said, &#39;I&#39;m so glad I saw that&#39; because she realized for the first time there were yellow tears, white tears, brown tears and black tears. Every tear was the same color. They all felt the same sadness,&quot; said Batres.</span></p></body>
