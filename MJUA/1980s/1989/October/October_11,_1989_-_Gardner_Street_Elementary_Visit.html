It became a Hollywood production in Hollywood.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The school was spruced up and security tightened. Media advisers herded the crowds of television and newspaper reporters. Glossy programs were prepared for school district officials and invited dignitaries.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the Los Angeles school district&rsquo;s top music coaches perfected the Gardner school choir&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;We Are the World,&rdquo; a tune Jackson co-wrote. And The Boys, a new group that Motown Records hopes will duplicate the success of the Jackson Five, were there to sing and share the limelight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Laura Gerson, Jackson&rsquo;s sixth-grade teacher, introduced her former student.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I remember seeing Michael for the first time on the playground. I remember thinking he was a beautiful little kid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I had never heard of the Jackson Five.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It wasn&rsquo;t until later she learned that he was a talented singer. &ldquo;He never talked about himself; he just settled down and was one of the kids.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But occasionally, he would disappear now and then to perform on television. . . . I knew he would be great, but I had no idea how great a singer, composer and songwriter he would become.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, dressed in a tight-fitting black-and-red outfit with silver buckles and a thick silver belt, walked on stage to loud applause and scattered screams.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I am deeply touched and honored that the PTA, principal, faculty members and students have been so kind as to dedicate the auditorium, where I sat as a child, in my honor,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;We must all never forget that the children are our future and without them humankind will become extinct.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After receiving the key to the school, Jackson was escorted by security people through crowds of screaming children and onlookers to Room 8, his former classroom, where he autographed the wall. As he walked, he flashed the peace sign and blew kisses to the children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was an 11-year-old lead singer for the Jackson Five when he moved to Los Angeles from Gary, Ind., with his four older brothers. They lived in the Hollywood home of Motown President Berry Gordy Jr.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He attended Gardner for only a few months before the brothers&rsquo; first single, &ldquo;I Want You Back,&rdquo; hit the top of the charts on Dec. 6, 1969. A few months later, the group added three more No. 1 hits, &ldquo;ABC,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Love You Save&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Soon after that, Jackson switched to private tutoring and began his retreat into the sheltered world of the superstar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he has been so excited about this whole event,&rdquo; said Bob Jones, a former Motown executive who has helped guide Jackson&rsquo;s career since soon after the family moved to Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It brings back a portion of the childhood he never had,&rdquo; said Jones, now vice president of MJJ Productions, Jackson&rsquo;s management company.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Parents at Gardner considered it a stroke of luck that Jackson accepted the invitation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We just took a chance and wrote a little dinky letter asking him to come. He must receive thousands of letters like that,&rdquo; said Judy Drury, one of the parents who organized the event. &ldquo;His time is expensive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Gardner of 1989 is a bit more cosmopolitan than the Gardner that Jackson attended 20 years ago. Today, the students come from 37 countries on six continents and speak languages such as Armenian, Tagalog, Spanish, Hindi and Ibo, a Nigerian tongue. &ldquo;It is the ideal place for Jackson and his theme, &lsquo;We Are the World&rsquo; &rdquo; Drury said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last year, Drury noted, Gardner parents were protesting the failure of the school district to complete a long-delayed renovation of the school. &ldquo;And now we are celebrating the completion with Michael Jackson,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is a fitting end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Justin Permijo, a 10-year-old fifth-grader, saw some lessons to be learned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It is good to see that good people can come out of this school,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not doing this for the publicity. I think he really likes this school.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bobbie Moore, a fourth-grade teacher, included herself among Jackson&rsquo;s admirers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just of the senior citizen variety,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/5972754/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Associated Press&rdquo; (October 12, 1989)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190827212831/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/5972754/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson&rsquo;s homecoming excited Gardner Street Elementary School pupils, who watched as the pop music super-star helped dedicate a remodeled auditorium named in his honor. &ldquo;This is the happiest day of my life,&rdquo; said Jackson, a sixth-grader at the Hollywood school during the 1969-70 school year. Jackson, wearing a leather outfit covered in zippers, studs and buckles, arrived at the school Wednesday to students&#39; squeals of &quot;Michael! Michael!&quot; and was guided into the building by police officers. After speeches by school officials, pupils and parents, Jackson was presented a commemorative plaque by his former teacher, Laura Qerson. &ldquo;I am deeply touched and honored that the PTA, principal, faculty members and students have been so kind as to dedicate this auditorium, where I sat as a child, in my honor,&quot; Jackson said. Janique Hennessee, 11, said she was so excited to see Jackson that she started crying, but Jackson came up to her and dried her tears.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chris Cadman, author,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He made an appearance for the unveiling and later showed his gratitude by paying the music teacher&rsquo;s salary; planted memorial rose bushes and signed his signature on the wall of his old 6th grade school room with the words:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael Jackson - Love the children.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Also present at the presentation was Rose Fine, who tutored him and his brothers during their Motown days.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the ceremony, he was shown around the school, was presented with a key and joined the student choir in singing &ldquo;We Are The World&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
