After a few months of work at Westlake, producer/songwriter Bryan Loren, who was only 23 at the time, joined the team and worked in a third room at the studio.&rdquo;); the vocal recording sessions most likely occurred in 1990.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Siegfried, magician/entertainer of &ldquo;Siegfried &amp; Roy&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Secret Life of Siegfried and Roy: How the Tiger Kings Tamed Las Vegas&rdquo; biography (2008)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When [Siegfried and Roy] first met Jackson, he was underage and, while allowed to perform on stage at the MGM, was legally prohibited from watching shows in the audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The lads grew quite close to the adult Jackson, visiting him often at his home in Florida. Seigfried has said: &quot;If I had to describe an angel, I would be describing Michael. His purity, his sincerity, his boyish sense of wonder - I know no adult like him... For us, Michael is quite simply magic.&quot; Jackson even wrote a song for their Secret Gallery album, which they released in 2001 as a salute to their show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jackson loved animals. His private zoo at infamous Neverland Ranch was legendary - and he&#39;d actually planned a tiger habitat to emulate Siegfried and Roy&#39;s at the Jungle Palace and the Mirage. The habitat&#39;s preliminary models were to be made by Thomas Maple, one of Roy&#39;s animals trainers, but the deal took so long to finalize that Jackson lost interest and his habitat never materialized.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson hired Siegfried and Roy&#39;s veterinarian, Dr Dinnes, who had found Leo, their African lion. Dinnes acted as veterinarian of the Neverland Zoo and supplied Jackson with many of his animals, including some that had grown too large for Siegfried and Roy to use in their show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Siegfried, Roy and Michael Jackson had been just boys when they first met, but they became more intertwined as time went by. The three men shared a close friendship with movie legend Elizabeth Taylor. Siegfried and Roy had known Elizabeth since their big showbiz breakthrough at the Gala des Rois in Monte Carlo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...One night, their close friend Michael Jackson, who&#39;d come to Japan for a visit, was sitting in the royal box and Siegfried made the mistake of introducing him from the stage. Instantly, half the audience rushed to the box. Luckily, because it was used for an illusion called the Hangman Execution, a trap door was built into the floor of the box, and security guards sneaked Jackson through it and away from the mob.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2009/jun/28/siegfried-death-michael-jackson-it-hurts/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Las Vegas Sun&rdquo; (June 28, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912005730/https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2009/jun/28/siegfried-death-michael-jackson-it-hurts/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was a good, good friend, one of the finest entertainers.
