Or the phony-looking mustache and teeth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the thin man in the red baseball cap wasn&rsquo;t casing the joint, as employees feared when they called police.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was singer Michael Jackson, hoping not to be noticed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The encounter happened about 5 p.m. in the Sycamore Plaza mall. Wearing his get-up, Jackson was looking at rings.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Employee Julie Andrews (not the singer) said she became suspicious because he kept adjusting his mustache and looking in a mirror. Another Zales store had recently been robbed by men wearing disguises.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Employees summoned security guard H. N. Edwards, who asked the suspicious character to step outside. Why was he wearing a false mustache? Edwards demanded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I have to,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in disguise. I&rsquo;m Michael Jackson.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;My first thought was this guy had gotten off the elevator between floors,&rdquo; Edwards said Tuesday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, one of the best-known pop singers in America, said the disguise was necessary to avoid being mobbed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Edwards asked him to remove the mustache. He did and, sure enough, fans began gathering and asking for autographs. Three squad cars arrived.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The officers were convinced he was who he said he was, and he went on his way,&rdquo; Officer Diane Sliester said Tuesday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson and a boy he was with visited a gift store and bought several toy figurines and a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses, Sliester said. Then they drove away in a brown Mercedes-Benz.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/03/13/michael-jackson-james-safechuck-jewelry-story-footage/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;TMZ&rdquo; (March 13, 2019)</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (archived)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A report from when the story first broke said Michael only purchased toys and some sunglasses that day.</span></p></body>
