Michael was one of the guests and we met to discuss the songs he would be performing. One of them was &quot;Rock With Me&quot; from the &quot;Off The Wall Album.&quot; I remember Quincy Jones telling me at the time that the next album &quot;Thriller&quot; was going to be even bigger. He wasn&#39;t kidding. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Winters, actor in &ldquo;Westside Story&rdquo; film (&ldquo;A-Rab&rdquo; character)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Diana Ross introduced us as he was to appear on her TV Special that Diana had; she also asked me to work on it with her. At the time I had been doing all of her stage and TV shows. Michael Jackson was to be a guest and when he turned up for rehearsals Diana introduced me to him. The first thing he said to me before even saying hello was &ldquo;I know you&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so Michael&rdquo;, I said. He said &ldquo;I watch you almost every week, you know &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo; and he snapped his fingers and did a little step and smiled. I understood.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From that moment on there was nothing to explain to each other, as we were both on the same wavelength.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He told me &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my favorite film David or should I say A-rab&rdquo; and he laughed &ldquo;and I have loads of questions I&rsquo;d like to ask you about it, if that&rsquo;s alright&rdquo; Michael was very polite and respectful and he even seemed a little shy and withdrawn. He was a sweetheart and I certainly loved his work. A-rab was the role I played in the film &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The performances of &lsquo;Rock With You&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ease On Down The Road&rsquo; both solo and as duets with Diana Ross were recorded at the old KTTV Studios.
