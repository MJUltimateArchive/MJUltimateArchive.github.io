In contrast to the charismatic, strutting figure on stage, he wrestled with a Bambi-like shyness. Despite the resurgence in his popularity, he complained of feeling alone -- almost abandoned. He was 23.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I asked why he didn&#39;t live on his own like his brothers, rather than at his parents&#39; house, he said, &quot;Oh, no, I think I&#39;d die on my own. I&#39;d be so lonely. Even at home, I&#39;m lonely. I sit in my room and sometimes cry. It is so hard to make friends, and there are some things you can&#39;t talk to your parents or family about. I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...In the 1981 interview, he told me, &quot;My real goal is to fulfill God&#39;s purpose. I didn&#39;t choose to sing or dance. But that&#39;s my role, and I want to do it better than anybody else. I still remember the first time I sang in kindergarten class. I sang &#39;Climb Every Mountain,&#39; and everyone got so excited.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s beautiful at the shows when people join together. It&#39;s our own little world. For that hour and a half, we try to show there is hope and goodness. It&#39;s only when you step back outside the building that you see all the craziness.&quot;</span></p></body>
