Susan Blond got us backstage and she was screaming that Katharine Hepburn was backstage and that if I didn&#39;t hurry I wouldn&#39;t have my picture taken with her, but I missed it all. Michael Jackson introduced us to his brothers, they all said they wanted portraits. Michael&#39;s gotten so handsome since I saw him that time with Stephanie Mills.

We had to kick kids out of them. Michael&#39;s show was maybe the best I&#39;ve seen. He&#39;s such a good dancer, and he goes into a hole and comes out the other side in a different outfit, I don&#39;t know how he does it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Unknown newspaper snippet (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://archive.org/details/002_20191106_201911"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jackson Five concert at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night was marred by gangs running through the aisles. But some folks couldn&#39;t take their eyes off Katharine Hepburn. It was Kate&#39;s first concert, as far as anyone could tell. The Great Kate doesn&#39;t go in for these loud concerts and prefers the solitude of her apartment here and her hideaway in Maine. But, there she was, up front with her friends, hiding behind dark glasses. It didn&#39;t help. Her press agents tipped off photographers who went looking for her. It didn&#39;t matter because even the rock and punk fans in the Garden knew it was Kate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She attended the concert to see her young friend, singer Michael Jackson, a budding actor who had been getting some lessons from Jane Fonda. Kate met Jackson when he visited the set of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; with Fonda.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kate also visited Jackson at the Garden secretly during his rehearsals. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can stay through the whole concert if it&#39;s this loud&quot;, she warned. But she did stay, much to the joy of her niece, Patricia, and friends who were with her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hepburn is perusing movie scripts for Jackson, but the lid was closed tight on that topic. And, almost as silently as she appeared in the Garden, Kate quietly slipped out of town yesterday. Said her office: She&#39;s unreachable. Well, most stars are.</span></p></body>
