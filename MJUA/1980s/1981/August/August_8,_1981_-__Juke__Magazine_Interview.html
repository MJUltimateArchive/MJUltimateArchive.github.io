		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Juke&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Juke&rdquo; magazine (August 8, 1981), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Accompanying Michael in the office in Los Angeles for this interview was younger brother Randy. It was a ploy used originally with sister Janet in tow, who related the questions to Michael from the interview. This was done differently, with Randy on hand for support. With being extremely shy, Michael sometimes wished he could be as normal as everyone else and not be on call to be the well known entertainer that people wanted to approach.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;If there is one wish I could have I&rsquo;d wish for anonymity. I&rsquo;d give anything to go to a party and not be recognised, and not be asked to entertain, not be expected not to be charming all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was keen to make another film, an ambition he&rsquo;d had since making The Wiz. He had planned to just prior to the Triumph tour with his brothers, but they objected to his plans as they wanted to go out on the road.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The film in question was &lsquo;Forbidden Love&rsquo; rumoured to be with Tatum O&rsquo;Neal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was also considering a part in &lsquo;A Chorus Line&rsquo; for the character Paul.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very sensitive, emotional story, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite Stevie wonder calling him as &ldquo;the best R&amp; B singer in the world&rdquo; and people considering him as a disco singer, did he feel pigeon-holed being put in this category.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think disco&rsquo;s a dirty word. I mean, music is so divided into colour already, but with disco you had white people and black people dancing together in the same room. They didn&rsquo;t care about the colour of your skin. They didn&rsquo;t care about what colour the person singing the song was, they just dug the music for what it was. And I&rsquo;m the took that attitude home with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rushent enquired if father Joe still had control of him and his brother&rsquo;s careers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He has a lot of interest and suggestions. But basically we make the decisions. It&rsquo;s, uh, great we have a lot of disagreements but there are no real quarrels. After you&rsquo;ve grown up with someone and slept with him, then you don&rsquo;t have any problems communicating with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke of the success of his OFF THE WALL album and the marketing ploy by Motown in using Diana Ross to promote their first album. Michael was keen to point out that The Jackson 5 was already well known.</span></p></body>
