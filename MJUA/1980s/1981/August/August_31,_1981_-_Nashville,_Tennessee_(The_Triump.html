Michael had an exceptional talent that shone the brightest. Backstage I was able to meet them all. They were very gracious. At that time, &#39;Elvira&#39; was at the top of the pop charts, and to my surprise they sang &#39;Elvira&#39; to me and my sons. It was an evening we will never forget.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Golden and his sons also performed that night, singing &#39;Happy Birthday&#39; to Jackson, who&#39;d just turned 23 years old.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was amazed to watch him over the years as he accomplished even higher achievements and became one of the world&#39;s greatest entertainers,&quot; says Golden. &quot;Michael stood out as a fantastic talent. He had the whole ball of wax -- not only a great voice, but the ability, flexible ability, and dancing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rusty Golden (William Lee Golden&rsquo;s son), comment on Douglas Harrison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Averyfineline&rdquo; blog (July 14, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101213134722/averyfineline.com/2009/07/07/rip-mj/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael and his brothers came out of their dressing room and saw Dad, they all broke into the chorus of &ldquo;ELVIRA&rdquo; as it was the #1 song in the nation at that time (pop and country). BUT&hellip;after the singing was over, Michael turned to me and said, &ldquo;I remember when the Oak Ridge Boys were the #1 Gospel Group. Do they still sing Gospel??&rdquo; I told him that yes they did and then he went onto tell me that he LOVED Gospel music&hellip; mentioning Andrae Crouch, Rev. James Cleveland and a few others. Yes, I know that those were NOT SG artists, but remember, MJ was after all BLACK and that&rsquo;s the type gospel music they knew. He mentioned how much his mother Katherine was also a huge fan of &ldquo;Gospel Music&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK&hellip;as far as the look on his face in this picture (Image 001)&hellip;..here&rsquo;s the TRUE STORY!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Seconds before the camera flash went off, a Jackson&rsquo;s aide rushed up to MJ and handed him a Sharpie pen and about 25 or so cocktail sized napkins into his &ldquo;GLOVE&rdquo; and then said &ldquo;Hey Mikey&hellip;.the promoter wants you to sign these&rdquo;. I well remember the aide getting out of the way of the shot but MJ is looking straight at him and no&hellip;.not too happy. More mad than sad. After the flashes of about 10 cameras went off, Michael just sorta&rsquo; said to anyone who could hear&hellip;&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t we have any regular pictures to sign? I mean c&rsquo;mon man&hellip;NAPKINS????&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hahahahahahaha!!!!!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&rsquo;s the TRUE STORY of the look on his face in that picture. Up until then he was a very quiet yet pleasant superstar who was happy to talk about Gospel Music.</span></p></body>
