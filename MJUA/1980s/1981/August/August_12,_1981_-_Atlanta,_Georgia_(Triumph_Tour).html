		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Atlanta, Georgia (Triumph Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Interview date assessed by the fact the writer was there to see The Jacksons &ldquo;[take] the Atlanta audience, as the previous ones, by complete surprise.&rdquo;; the article also contains photos from the &ldquo;concert in Atlanta&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A"><a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105419/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/ebony81.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Ebony&quot; magazine (October 1981)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Predictably, Michael&#39;s astounding successes again sparked rumors about his future. When asked why he doesn&#39;t go out on his own, like his good friend Miss Ross did when she split with the singing Supremes, Michael says: &quot;It&#39;s just not the time.&quot; Then asked, &quot;What&#39;s next for Michael Jackson,&quot; he replies: &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m looking forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the things Michael was looking forward to was the recent Jacksons&#39; nationwide tour, which included two dates in Atlanta, where the fabulous live brothers raised $250,000 for the children of Atlanta. Before the tour was in full swing, rumors surfaced again: This would be Michael&#39;s last appearance with his brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">EBONY wanted to know if there was any truth in the rumor. Michael was asked point-blank, &quot;Are you leaving the Jacksons?&quot; &quot;Uhm,&quot; he hesitated and then answered: &quot;Yes and no. I can&#39;t really say. Uhm,&quot; he paused again and continued: &quot;It&#39;s hard to say right now. We haven&#39;t really talked about it yet. It&#39;s something that&#39;s just got to happen on its own. Right now, it hasn&#39;t.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael seemed more bemused than pained by the question. The group had barely launched the nationwide tour and they were feeling good about it. They had shelled out $1.4 million in electronic equipment to produce some startling special effects and took the Atlanta audience, as the previous ones, by complete surprise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackie, the first-born brother, was not surprised that many of the fans were there because they thought this would be the last time that the brothers performed together as The Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There&#39;ve been a lot of rumors about that, but you know about the Jackson brothers,&quot; he began. &quot;Are you breaking up?&quot; he was asked. &quot;Not really,&quot; Jackie quickly responded. He explained: &quot;Right now, we&#39;re each doing individual things. I&#39;m more into producing and writing; so is Michael. He&#39;s making some movies. We&#39;ve been doing that for quite a while now, but we&#39;re doing more of it right now. But we&#39;re still going to come back and do concerts and things like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the Jacksons are not on the road performing or in the studio recording for Epic, they pursue their special interests, Jackie says. He proudly adds that he and his wife Enid are in business together in Los Angeles. One division of their enterprise, Jazbo, designs and produces clothes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;re getting a line of clothes out right now,&quot; he enthused as he points to the rack of colorful costumes and clothes in his hotel suite. He hugs his wife and adds, &quot;I&#39;m quite busy right now--helping her out a lot. In fact, she did the costumes for this whole tour, also for Stevie Wonder&#39;s tour. She&#39;s doing designs for a lot of people right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His excited feeling is eclipsed by his youngest brother, 19-year-old Randy, who miraculously survived an automobile accident two years ago. Some medical experts predicted that he would never walk again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was smiling, though not broadly, when the conversation turned to the future of The Jacksons as a vocal group. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard the talk,&quot; he began. That&#39;s just a lot of rumors. Basically, it&#39;s just that we&#39;re kind of getting involved in a lot of different projects and things in business. Everybody is going the way they feel,&quot; he offers as a reason the rumors wouldn&#39;t stop spreading.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He says, &quot;The Jacksons will still produce and record their albums. But we&#39;re sort of spreading out a little more, giving ourselves a little more space to be more creative, to do more writing or singing or whatever we want to do--acting, producing, whatever. Sometimes, it&#39;s more space to do other things that&#39;re needed and still sing together.&quot; The young composer-percussionist-pianist who completed his high school class assignments while recovering from the automobile accident and walked without crutches to receive his graduation diploma, becomes philosophical:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We feel that we&#39;ve come to the age--we&#39;ve learned so much--where we can do other things. We&#39;ve been doing them so long and it&#39;s not easy to let those things get away.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael, who has so much respect for the individual talents of each of his brothers, doesn&#39;t like always being out front of the group and singled out as the star. He has cradled that feeling for quite some time. When he turned 21 two years ago, he addressed himself to that subject as well as the rumor that he is leaving The Jacksons. He told JET magazine about his future:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I want to continue to grow. To me, the biggest sin of all sins is to be given a gift, a talent, because it&#39;s actually a gift from God, to take that and not cultivate it and make it grow, that&#39;s the biggest sin in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Responding to a plea of female fans who begged him not to leave The Jacksons &quot;because you need your brothers and your brothers need you,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think fans would be concerned.... and to see the split like that would break their hearts and especially when groups start changing members, they lose originality and I&#39;d really hate that....</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Let nature take its course. I let be what must be, and if that is to come, it&#39;s going to happen, because there are so many things I do want to do, really. I want to explore, experiment, and branch out to do different things and it is always a time problem.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As &quot;Ebony&quot; went to press, the tour of the fabulous five had ended on a successful note. And when asked if he is leaving the Jacksons, Michael&#39; answer was: &quot;Yes and no.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons played a benefit show in Atlanta at the Omni Auditorium in aid of the Atlanta Children&rsquo;s Foundation. Michael used his celebrity status to bring on board support for the foundation from fellow friends, Kenny Rodgers, Lionel Richie, Christopher Reeves, Brooke Shields, Gladys Knight, Richard Pryor, Neil Diamond, Donna Summer, Henry Winkler and Magic Johnson. Most sent Michael telegrams of support for the event and foundation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jacksons raised $ 250,000 on the night. A jewelled costume he wore at the show was designed by brother Jackie&rsquo;s wife Enid.</span></p></body>
