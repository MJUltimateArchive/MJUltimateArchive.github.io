When they arrive everyone gathers around the console to hear his efforts. Michael commented:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything for the break down yet. I&rsquo;m gonna need some kind of solo thing here, maybe a keyboard riff. Could you do that James? Right here during this section. What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of which the reply came:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Like Diana (Ross) did in Upside Down, you mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No. Not exactly. Nothing too close to her,&rdquo; Michael said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is a conversation initiated by Michael about how technology was changing at the time, and gave readers an insight on how Michael was keeping up to date with what was developing in the way music was going to be heard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Pretty soon these electronics are going to replace not only musicians but the instruments themselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joking with drummer Chris Allen, Michael continued:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Seriously it has over one hundred programmable drumbeats. I mean, buddy, you are obsolete. You push the right button and you get bass, snare, hi-hat, tambourine, congas, cowbell, and even handclaps. This session with me tonight might be your last job!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael drinks herb tea during the session and he&rsquo;s fairly pleased with one song he&rsquo;s been recording, although he&rsquo;s still insecure about it being a hit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well, what do you think? Do you really like it? I mean I gotta have a hit out of all this stuff. Something, one of these tunes, has got to jump off the album and really score.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Soul Teen&rdquo; magazine (June 1981), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A similar article to the one written by Anthony Hill for Rock &amp; Soul Magazine in September 1981. Ollie Jamison writes of his three weeks with Michael for Soul Teen. This story however, seems to follow the evening after, when they recorded a new song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bass player Carl speaks of the pressure Michael faces after the huge success of Off The Wall.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;How do you follow a multi-platinum album? With another one? And that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s feeling so pressured. Man, I wouldn&rsquo;t want that hanging over my head. I mean, unless you come up with something pretty strong, it looks like your success was just some one shot fluke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is flying around the studio, according to Jamison burning some nervous energy, setting up wires to the control board and checking the drums and microphones. He&rsquo;s excited also that Pete, one of the session musicians is bringing in a synthesizer that Tom Oberheim built for Stevie Wonder.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is flying around the studio, according to Jamison burning some nervous energy, setting up wires to the control board and checking the drums and microphones.

I mean like a whole violin section &ndash; and horns, too. I think the synthesizer will help with the tune we did last night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jamison also offers an insight into Michael&rsquo;s doubts and insecurities.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking directly to him he said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael, you gotta stop this, man. I&rsquo;m getting scared to leave you alone with a song after we&rsquo;ve finished it. Your mood swings are just too vast!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael agreed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yeah I guess I am getting a little confused. I don&rsquo;t remember, did I like the tunes on &lsquo;Off The Wall&rsquo; when we were putting that trip together?</span></p></body>
