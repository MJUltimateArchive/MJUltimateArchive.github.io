The jacket, of which Michael ordered a similar one, only appeared in a &ldquo;Kings of the Wild Frontier&rdquo; televised performance during the British Rock and Pop Awards, which occurred on February 24, 1981.

I fumbled for the receiver. &#39;Hello?&#39; A soft, high pitched voice echoed down the line to me. &#39;Hello,&#39; it repeated. &#39;Is that Adam Ant?&#39; The voice had an American accent and sounded vaguely familiar, but my fuzzy brain reacted angrily.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Terry,&#39; I said, thinking it was one of the Ants&#39; drummers playing a prank. &#39;Stop pissing about. It&#39;s 4am and I&#39;m trying to sleep.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;No, it&#39;s not Terry,&#39; said the voice. &#39;It&#39;s Michael. Is that Adam Ant?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Very funny, Terry, now fuck off.&#39; I slammed the phone down, rolled over and tried to get back to sleep. The phone went again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Hello,&#39; I barked into the receiver. &#39;Hi, no, really, it is me, Michael Jackson,&#39; said the funny voice, &#39;and I just want to ask you...&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Terry, if you don&#39;t stop this I&#39;m going to come over there and fucking thump you.&#39; Bang. Again the phone went down. Again I rolled over. Again the phone rang.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I grabbed the receiver and shouted: &#39;Terry! That&#39;s IT!&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Er, hi, is that Adam Ant?&#39; This time the voice was deep, sonorous, American and calm. It didn&#39;t sound anything like Terry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Oh, oh,&#39; I stammered. &#39;Yes, this is Adam. Who are you?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;I&#39;m Quincy Jones, calling from LA. Sorry, we probably woke you, but I&#39;m here with Michael Jackson and he&#39;d like to speak with you. Is that OK?&#39; A pause, and then that same soft voice. &#39;Hi, Adam, it&#39;s Michael. Sorry if we woke you.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Oh, no, sorry to have been so rude,&#39; I apologised.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said he had just seen the video for our song Kings Of The Wild Frontier. &#39;It&#39;s great,&#39; he said. &#39;How did you get the tom-tom sound?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Oh, thanks. Well, we use two drum kits and then add loads of other percussion on top...&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;That&#39;s great, Adam,&#39; Michael interrupted. &#39;I really like your jacket.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Huh? My jacket?&#39; I tried to think. &#39;Berman&#39;s and Nathan&#39;s in London&#39;s Covent Garden. They supply costumes for movies.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Wow. That&#39;s great,&#39; he replied. &#39;How do you spell that? Bowman&#39;s and who?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;No, B-E-R-M-A-N-apostrophe-S and N-A-T-H-A-N-apostrophe-S.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Great, thanks.

After another stop-over in London, I flew to Los Angeles, determined to rest while at the same time working on getting into movies. My agent, Michael, had lined up a few things for me, and I was determined to push him to get more &ndash; mostly they were dinners with directors, an occasional read-through of a script, getting to meet producers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before things got under way, I went to visit Michael Jackson at home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Motown president Suzanne de Passe took me to [Hayvenhurst]... Dressed in a red V-neck pullover, white shirt with bow tie, black turned-up jeans, white socks and sneakers, he still looked like the Michael Jackson who had first become famous with his brothers. I met his mother and sisters &ndash; and instantly fell in love with La Toya as she handed me a 7UP. Michael took me into his private cinema and we watched James Cagney in White Heat (&lsquo;Look Ma, top of the world!&rsquo;), preceded by the video for Michael&rsquo;s &lsquo;Beat It&rsquo;, which was kind of strange. He didn&rsquo;t seem to want a response to the video, but of course I told him how good it was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout that afternoon I mostly sat quietly, trying to be English, reserved and polite. After the movie we went to see his pets &ndash; a llama, a ram and two deer (there was no chimpanzee at the time). As we walked around, he told me that he was talking to Steven Spielberg about making a movie, and I said something about working with people of that calibre would guarantee it was a hit. He stopped walking and turned to me, his big brown eyes stared straight at me possibly the first time that afternoon, and he said, &lsquo;If you work with the best people, you can&rsquo;t go wrong.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the way back to my Sunset Strip apartment in a limousine, I felt incredibly privileged to have been a guest at Michael Jackson&rsquo;s home. I&rsquo;d come a long way for a man with a silly name, I thought.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/adam-ant-1263309"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;NME&rdquo; (September 12, 2012)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102171910/https://www.nme.com/news/music/adam-ant-1263309"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Remembering his time with Jackson, he said: &ldquo;I was touring &lsquo;Kings Of The Wild Frontier&rsquo; and I got this call at about 5.30 in the morning saying &lsquo;Hi, this is Michael Jackson&rsquo;. I just thought it was my drummer Chris, so I told him to fuck off and put the phone down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He continued: &ldquo;He rang back again and I put the phone down again then Quincy Jones called me and said &lsquo;This is Michael calling&rsquo;. They were doing &lsquo;Thriller&rsquo; and he asked me how I got the drum sound on &lsquo;Kings Of The Wild Frontier&rsquo;. I told him to speak to our drummer. And then I got another call to ask where I got the jacket, so I told him and he went there and got it copied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He continued further: &ldquo;I got invited over to LA and I went to his family home, because he was still living with his mum and dad. All his brothers and sisters were there and I just spent the day walking round the house with all the snakes and llamas. I actually followed him onstage right after he did the moonwalk for the first time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Smash Hits magazine Jan 20 - Feb 2 1983 Michael mentioned he and Adam were phone friends. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re phone friends. We talk about how to record that drum sound on Ant Music and stuff. He talks about my dancing and I talk about his dressing.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
