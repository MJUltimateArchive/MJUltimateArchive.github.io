He was at the QUEEN show that evening and came to see the band afterwards. He spent time with John Deacon and they talked about &lsquo;Another One Bites the Dust&rsquo; which Michael says must be a single. He also spent time with Freddie. He was 22 years old and was like an excited teenager. He had really enjoyed the show and was still &lsquo;up&rsquo; from it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John Deacon, &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; bass guitarist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143636/http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=John_Deacon_-_04-XX-1996_-_Bassist_%26_Bass_Techniques"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Bassist &amp; Bass Techniques&rdquo; magazine (April 1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;d been wanting to do a track like &ldquo;Another One Bites The Dust&rdquo; for a while, but originally all I had was the line and the bass riff. Gradually I filled it in and the band added ideas. I could hear it as a song for dancing but had no idea it would become as big as it did. The song got picked up off our album and some of the black radio stations in the US started playing it, which we&#39;ve never had before.&quot; In the end it was a famous fan who swayed the vote: &quot;Michael Jackson actually suggested we release it as a single. He was a fan of ours and used to come to our shows.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brian May, &ldquo;Queen&rdquo; lead guitarist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.express.co.uk/dayandnight/110639/Freddie-and-Jacko-s-secret-collaboration"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Express (June 29, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190827164029/https://www.express.co.uk/dayandnight/110639/Freddie-and-Jacko-s-secret-collaboration"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He used to come and see us when we were on tour in the States,&rdquo; recalls the guitarist, 61. &ldquo;He and Freddie became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael&rsquo;s house, tracks which have never seen the light of day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...May goes on to reveal that Jackson was also influential when it came to persuading Queen to release their famous hit Another One Bites The Dust, after hearing the band perform the track during their The Game tour at the beginning of the Eighties.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was Michael who heard Another One Bites The Dust when he came to see us on The Game tour and told us we were mad if we didn&rsquo;t release it as a single,&rdquo; says May.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
