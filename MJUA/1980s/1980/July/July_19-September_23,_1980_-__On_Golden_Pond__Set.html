Jane noticed, and says, &ldquo;Dad was also painfully self conscious and shy in life, and he really only felt comfortable when he was behind the mask of a character. He could liberate himself only when he was being someone else. That&rsquo;s a lot like Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In some ways Michael reminds me of the walking wounded. He&rsquo;s an extremely fragile person.

It was the first time he had been in that region but he must have liked it because later he bought his ranch in that same area. Anyway, as we walked around the ranch which was perched right at the edge of the mountain overlooking Goleta, I pointed to a spot where I told him I wanted to be buried. Michael had a melt down right then and there when he heard this. He shrieked and bent over and said &ldquo;no, no, no!&rdquo; &ldquo; What&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever talk about your dying,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever think about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Dick Sutton, unit driver, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.wmur.com/article/n-h-man-reminisces-about-mingling-with-stars-during-on-golden-pond-shoot/5210878"><span class="cs8567212B">WMUR</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I showed [Michael] how to fish,&rdquo; Sutton said. &ldquo;I showed him how bait his hook and everything like that.

While Henry and Katharine usually ate lunch in private, the rest of us (crew included) would eat outside the house where picnic tables and benches were set up. I was fourteen at the time. Michael was very quiet, and I actually landed up sitting next to him - Jane sat across the table and introduced him to me as &quot;her friend, Michael&quot;. He seemed very nice, but sat and listened to our conversation rather than join in. I didn&#39;t see him again after that one time. Jane, herself, was busy with other things and often flew back and forth from California, so he may have flown back with her after that day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael returned home from the set of &lsquo;Golden Pond&rsquo; he took back with him a set of tee-shirts with &quot;Camp Kuchi Kaiai.&quot; printed on them. When sister La Toya enquired what the print was on them, Michael explained that it was something that&rsquo;s in the film. This inspired La Toya to write the song &quot;Camp Kuchi Kaiai&quot; with sister Janet, that was eventually released in 1981 on the B- side of &lsquo;Stay The Night&rsquo;, and featured on her album MY SPECIAL LOVE.</span></p></body>
