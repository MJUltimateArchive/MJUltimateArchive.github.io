			were the nights Stevie Wonder played at MSG, but Gil Scott-Heron confirmed it was the &ldquo;second
			night&rdquo; that Michael appeared as a guest.</span></p>
	<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Gil Scott-Heron, spoken-word performer on the tour,<a
				class="cs76EFAA84"
				href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KbPWYdpts78C&amp;q=michael+jackson#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20jackson&amp;f=false"><span
					class="cs8567212B"> &ldquo;The Last Holiday&rdquo;</span></a></span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By 1980, I was an old hand at playing Madison Square Garden. If I had
			still been living in New York, I could have gone through a yawn or two on my second night there with Stevie.
			New Yorkers had a shield of cool oblivion and paid little attention to the Garden, the Empire State
			Building, and even the Statue of Liberty.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Indeed there were millions of New Yorkers who had never visited any
			of those landmarks and knew only that the Garden was down near Times Square and that you played ball
			there.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Only the most literate music fans would mention that Madison Square
			Garden was also a concert venue. And even they would have to say also a concert venue, indicating that was
			not its primary function. Sort of like why there were so few hockey games at Carnegie Hall.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I might have been losing my arenaphobic attitude by that point. I had
			now done seven shows without an &quot;airplane hangar effect,&quot; echoes that never died. I was deciding
			that arenas that weren&#39;t auditoriums could be modified like cafeterias that weren&#39;t gymnasiums that
			I played basketball in while at Fieldston. I had already decided that my prejudice against arenas was
			selective, that I didn&#39;t necessarily dislike playing in front of a lot of people. In fact, the more the
			merrier. I was starting to compare the experience to playing on television, which I had initially hated. The
			idea of having my songs and my band all squeezed through a midrange mono speaker the size of an ashtray had
			depressed me as much as the thought of doing a lip-sync on American Bandstand or Soul Train. It had almost
			broken my heart to see the Temptations stumbling their way through &quot;Ain&#39;t Too Proud to
			Beg.&quot;</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was one thing undeniably advantageous about playing in a venue
			like Madison Square Garden. There would be, on certain occasions, an energy generated that turned a concert
			into an event, that gave an indoor performance an air of a festival, an aura of celebration. That was the
			special buzz, an inaudible hum of excitement and energy that vibrated through everyone in the place. It was
			running all through the Garden; in the darkened tunnels that led to the dressing rooms and the storage
			spaces crammed with sports equipment and other event paraphernalia. Hell, everyone from Jumbo to Tom Thumb
			or whoever P.T. Barnum had promoted had plodded or pranced through these shadowy passages. I felt it.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Beneath bright Broadway and traffic-choked avenues, there were other
			worlds that existed; worlds of magic and music and miracles. And tonight this was to be the world of Michael
			Jackson.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another Jackson. Just what I needed.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thousands of fans who fantasized about being like Mike, or simply
			liked Mike, would get a special spectacle this evening because the Prince of Pop was already in the house
			and rumored to be loosening up his nearly liquid limbs in some private pocket along the passageways by the
			time I finished my set. He was to be a very special delivery and join me and Stevie when we closed the
			evening. I got to see different performers join us onstage from Houston to Hollywood. You couldn&#39;t
			predict the next surprise Stevie would spring on his audience as we crossed the U.S.A. and Canada. It had
			become so routine for rockers and high rollers to finagle their faces into the finale that there was hardly
			a double take from the regulars or roadies, but the Michael Jackson rumor sent some shivers through both the
			rulers and the riffraff.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was pleased that everyone else was pleased. From the road
			representatives of Dick Griffey&#39;s Concerts West to certain venue venerables of the Madison Square Garden
			hierarchy, there was a noticeable neurosis and noise in the arena that evening.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had met Michael and a couple of his brothers before, but I
			couldn&#39;t say that I knew him or that he would have remembered me. I admired him, of course, since there
			was no way not to appreciate an artist who had sold as many records as McDonald&#39;s had sold burgers. I
			had been a guest of Greg Phillinganes on one sunshine-splashed afternoon at a studio in L.A. where the
			Jacksons were regrouping to do an album. Michael was one of the few phenoms remaining when I arrived and
			Greg organized a brief introduction to folks. I was cool with that, even pleased to meet them in person. It
			had not been as electric as meeting Quincy Jones or Miles Davis, but I wouldn&#39;t forget that it had
			happened. But what did I know? Only that this youngster, with the hair falling over one eye and a voice so
			soft and quiet that your ears had to reach for it, was record royalty&hellip;</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But these casual encounters with artists off duty gave me no warning
			about how the electricity would elevate, how the excitement level would rise in the arena when Michael
			Jackson joined us onstage as the band went into the reggae rhythm of &quot;Master Blaster.&quot; He would
			raise the voltage.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I often try to tell people how special Michael Jackson was, as though
			they don&#39;t know. Because I myself didn&#39;t know. I thought I did&mdash;until he came out for
			&quot;Master Blaster&quot; at Madison Square Garden.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stevie called for the monitor man to pull the rhythm track up and
			with a wide grin beckoned for his &quot;special guest,&quot; someone who needed no introduction. I looked
			behind me as he took three steps, paused a beat, and stood straighter and taller, turning solid then as from
			mist to man. I don&#39;t see that well. Sometimes.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He didn&#39;t just walk onto the stage. He turned solid as he came. A
			trick of the light. He glided past me into the spotlight. There was a surge of energy from the crowd that
			lifted the sound in the arena from stereo to quadraphonic and even the temperature seemed to rise when he
			touched the perimeter of the spotlight. And as the crowd&#39;s suspicions were confirmed by recognition, the
			buzz turned into an active roar. The monitor volume was overcome and Stevie&#39;s smile got wider and he
			clapped his hands close to his chest and waited for the turn, caught the opening when it swung around again
			and the house roar slid down to thunder again.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the hook arrived it was like a huge transport landing on foam:
			&quot;Didn&#39;t know you would be jammin&#39; until the break of dawn . . .&quot; Michael and I began on
			the beat and on the same harmony note, but as smoothly as he had floated from the shadows to my side, his
			voice climbed to the next harmony note where he seemed to cancel our collision and make himself at home
			again, two notes further up the scale.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After another chorus with me holding the mike for Mike I realized how
			prepared he was to do this and how unprepared I was to do it with him.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He knew the song. All of it. The lyrics, the changes, and all of the
			harmony parts. Hell, I hadn&#39;t got my part right until we got to Hartford. Tonight I felt like a six-foot
			mannequin clutching the base of the wireless like a giant gray ice-cream cone, frozen into a position of
			extending my arm between us, trying to collect both of our voices. It felt like reaching for water with a
			butterfly net. I was committed to remaining stationary and holding the sound stick steady. Michael might
			have been, but even while standing still he seemed to flow in every direction. Without a further thought I
			handed him the microphone and strolled to the shadows on our side of the stage.</span></p>
	<p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In essence I got to watch two wonders at once. Up close: a smiling
			Stevie at center stage behind his keyboard bank with his head slightly tilted in what had been my direction;
			and sliding in and out of the circle of soft light that usually told me where to stand I saw this youngster,
			bending with impossible balance, twisting the tempo around him like a thread that spins a top. And then he
			reversed it, twirling like a boneless ice skater. The symmetry was perfect because he was as still as a
			statue when the foundation of the verse appeared and Stevie came in again. I was looking ahead and saying I
			had thirty more shows to try that, to get it like Mike. Probably not.</span></p>

			&quot;Michael Jackson, who bopped out boldly and nipped all over the stage in designer jeans, silver jacket,
			and mirror shades.&quot;</span></p>
