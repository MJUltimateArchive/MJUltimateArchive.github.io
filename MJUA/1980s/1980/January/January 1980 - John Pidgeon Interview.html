		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">John Pidgeon Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date confirmed by the interview album notes and Rock&rsquo;s Backpages article</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">John Pidgeon, radio producer/writer, Rock&rsquo;s Backpages (June 15, 2009)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In January 1980, the gates of 4641 Hayvenhurst Avenue in Encino, California, were open, unguarded. The record-company PR greeted me at the door, and I waded after her through shaggy ivory carpet. Overhead, chandeliers twinkled like lights in an elfin grotto.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; she said, as if it were an insignificant point she had just remembered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind if his sister sits in on the interview, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Of course not. What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Janet. Oh, and one more thing. If you could direct your questions to Janet, she&rsquo;ll put them to Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My mouth opened to query this extraordinary request, but the arm that had been barring my way was behind me now, launching me through a double doorway and down several steps into the presence of he-who-must-not-be-addressed-directly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson stood up. I stuck out my hand and so did he. I held his flimsy fingers with unaccustomed care, suddenly fearful that I might hurt him. Jackson was stick thin, with fine skin and feeble hairs on his cheeks and chin that had never met a razor. His face was brown, haloed by an afro, and his nose was his own. The voice that welcomed me was tremulous. When I turned to say hello to Janet, she grinned as if this might all be a game. Jackson sat down again, and I perched on a hassock between brother and sister, separated by the glass top of a low table.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I found out later that I wasn&rsquo;t the only interviewer who had been asked to go along with the wacky ritual of using the then 13-year-old Janet as a conduit for questions. While it was happening, I was too taken aback &ndash; and too concerned that a transgression of this ridiculous rule might bring the interview to an abrupt end &ndash; to ponder Jackson&rsquo;s motives. In the end, I concluded that what Jackson craved was the erection of a protective barrier between himself and the rest of the world, symbolised by his habitual wearing in public of dark glasses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In January 1980, with his Off the Wall album cresting the album charts and its sublime stand-out track, Rock with You, a No 1 single, he agreed to be interviewed by me for Capital radio, an excerpt of which appears in a new documentary by Spike Lee.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Yes ... so, er, I was going to ... I mean, um &hellip;&rdquo; I began, looking from one Jackson to the other, unsure whose eyes to settle on, &ldquo;&hellip; if we could sort of go back to er &hellip; to er, you know, when you got started &hellip; er, when the Jackson Five got started &hellip; um, I was going to ask Michael how &hellip; they &hellip; fitted in to the Motown set-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A pause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael, how did you fit into the Motown set-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you, Janet. Yes, that&rsquo;s what I was trying to say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A longer pause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Errrrrr &hellip;&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s own hesitation was prolonged and curiously musical. If it had cropped up on a vocal track, his then-new producer Quincy Jones would, I&rsquo;m sure, have left it on the record for texture. &ldquo;We were doing a show at the Regal theatre in Chicago and it was like a talent show type of thing and we won, and Gladys Knight was there as well as a guy named Bobby Taylor, and they told Motown about us, and Motown was interested in seeing us audition for them. So we went to Berry Gordy&rsquo;s mansion in Detroit &ndash; indoor pool &ndash; and all the Motown stars were there &ndash; the Supremes, the Temptations, the Marvelettes, the Miracles &ndash; and we auditioned and they loved it, and Diana Ross came over to us special after the concert we did for them and she kissed us all and said we were marvellous and she said she wanted to play a special part in our career and that&rsquo;s how it started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gordy&rsquo;s mansion had made a big impression on Jackson and his brothers, the indoor pool especially. It was by far the biggest house the Jacksons had ever been invited into. Their own place in Gary, Indiana, was one storey with two bedrooms, one for parents Joe and Katherine, the other for the nine kids. Signing to Motown split the family up; several of the boys moving into Gordy&rsquo;s home, the rest moving in with Diana Ross, until Joe bought the house on Hayvenhurst Avenue in 1971.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What Jackson craved was the erection of a protective barrier between himself and the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And we did our first single, I Want You Back, it was gold, as well as ABC, The Love You Save, Never Can Say &hellip;, on and on and on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A tinkerbell giggle.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And that&rsquo;s how the interview continued: me pinging a question to Janet, she ponging it to Jackson, he pinging it back to the microphone. I almost got used to the process. I didn&rsquo;t bother correcting Janet when my question about Destiny &ndash; &ldquo;Apart from its commercial success, since the Jacksons had written and produced the album themselves, were they also pleased creatively with what the record?&rdquo; &ndash; emerged from her mouth as, &ldquo;D&rsquo;you think your brothers could&rsquo;ve done better?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I certainly did. I&rsquo;m sure my brothers did too, because I&rsquo;m never satisfied with anything &rsquo;cause I do believe deeply in perfection. If you&rsquo;re satisfied with everything, you&rsquo;re just going to stay at one level and the world will move ahead.&rdquo; A thought that had him laughing again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Destiny recording was the last time the Jacksons had enjoyed their brother&rsquo;s undivided attention. Even while they were on tour promoting the record, he was Lear-jetting back to LA as often as the schedule allowed to work on tracks for Off the Wall. This was the first record for which he had been allowed to choose his producer, and he had picked Jones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whatever Jackson&rsquo;s mounting problems, his voice, an instrument of rare beauty and expression, was not one of them. The purity of note, the timbre, was, I suppose, an accident of nature, but in order to express feelings, a singer has to be able to feel, to have felt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There is no real explanation. It&rsquo;s nothing to do with personal experience. My singing is just &ndash; I&rsquo;ll say it simple as possible &ndash; it&rsquo;s just Godly really. It&rsquo;s no real personal experience or anything that make it come across, just feeling and God; I&rsquo;ll say, mainly God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was 21, and he had been a star half his life. Ten years is a longer career than most in music. How did he see the next 10? &ldquo;I think secretly and privately, really deep within, there&rsquo;s a destiny for me. I&rsquo;ve had strong feelings for films, that something&rsquo;s directing me in that way for motion pictures, musicals and drama, that whole thing, to choreograph the films as well, even get into writing the pictures and doing the music.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I asked him how he felt about his music being labelled disco.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I hate labels, because it should be just music. Call it disco, call it anything, it&rsquo;s music to me, it&rsquo;s beautiful to the ear, and that&rsquo;s what counts. It&rsquo;s like you hear a bird chirping, you don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a bluejay, this one is a crow.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a beautiful sound, that&rsquo;s all that counts, and that is an ugly thing about men. They categorise, they get a little bit too racial about things, when it should all be together. That&rsquo;s why you hear us talk about the peacock a lot, because the peacock is the only bird of all the bird family that integrates every colour into one, and that&rsquo;s our main goal in music, is to integrate every race to one through music, and we&rsquo;re doing that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the sleeve of the Jacksons&rsquo; Triumph album, released later that year, Jackson would write, &ldquo;In all the bird family, the peacock is the only species that integrates all colors into one &hellip; We, like the peacock, try to integrate all races into one, through the love and power of music.&rdquo; Evidently he wanted to try the analogy out before airing it to a wider public. Just as well that I nodded approvingly. &ldquo;When you go to our concerts, you see every race out there, and they&rsquo;re all waving hands and they&rsquo;re holding hands and they&rsquo;re smiling. You see the kids out there dancing, as well as the grown-ups and the grandparents, all colours, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great&rdquo; &ndash; cue one last nervous giggle &ndash; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what keep me going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson withdrew from me the moment the interview was over. He remained in the room, but he wasn&rsquo;t there for me. The publicist showed me out without offering an explanation for her extraordinary precondition. When I keyed the ignition in my car, Rock with You came on. I turned off the radio. My thoughts were a mixture of amusement and annoyance at the pantomime I had allowed myself to take part in and disappointment that I hadn&rsquo;t learned anything about Michael Jackson or Motown that I didn&rsquo;t already know. I reminded myself that I hadn&rsquo;t really expected to, and I had his precious voice on tape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I met Jackson 36 years ago, although our verbal communication was indirect, at least we sat face to face, pressed flesh on flesh, breathed the same air.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Blank on Blank</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was dusk by the time I drove through the unguarded gates of 4641 Hayvenhurst Avenue. &hellip; A woman I recognised as Shirley Brooks appeared under the porch light. &hellip; Shirley was a publicist for Epic Records, and we&rsquo;d met before. As we shook hands, she told me I looked tired. &hellip; I waded through the shaggy ivory carpet, chandeliers twinkling on either side like lights in an elfin grotto, until, just as we were about to enter the next room, Shirley slowed, then stopped me with her arm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; she said, as if it was an insignificance she had overlooked and just remembered, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mind if his sister sits in on the interview, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Already aware of a distant figure on a marshmallow sofa, I shook my head readily.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Of course not, Shirley,&rdquo; I assured her with a smile. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Janet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Janet,&rdquo; I repeated.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh, and one more thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley paused, to ensure she had my attention. Anticipating another trivial afterthought, I wasn&rsquo;t ready for the bomb Shirley was about to drop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;If you could direct your questions to Janet, she&rsquo;ll put them to Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My mouth opened and I turned to query this extraordinary request, but the arm that had been barring my way was behind me now, launching me through a double doorway and down several carpeted steps into the presence of he-who-must-not-be-addressed-directly, while I struggled to convert a confused backward glance into a great-to-meet-you grin, and wondered whether I was permitted to say hello face to face or expected to channel my greeting via the kid sister too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson stood up. I stuck out my hand and so did he. I held his flimsy fingers carefully, fearful that I might hurt him. He was stick thin, with fine skin and hairs that had never seen a razor sprouting feebly here and there on his cheeks and chin. He still had his own nose, brown skin and an afro, as Off The Wall&rsquo;s cover shot confirms.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The voice that welcomed me was tremulous. When I turned to say hullo to Janet, she grinned as if this might all be a game. Michael sat down again, and I perched on a hassock between brother and sister, separated by the glass top of a low table. &hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then I leaned across the table, waving the microphone like a metal detector in front of me, unsure where to point it. I found out later that I wasn&rsquo;t the only interviewer who had been asked to go along with the wacky ritual of using thirteen-year-old Janet Jackson as a conduit for questions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Transcript (Work in Progress)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">John Pidgeon: &ldquo;Yeah, I was, I mean, if we could go back to uh, you know, when you got started, when the Jackson 5 got started... um, I was going to ask Michael how they fitted into the Motown set-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Janet Jackson: &ldquo;Michael, how did you fit into the Motown set-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: &ldquo;Uhhh... We were doing a show at the Regal theatre in Chicago and it was like a talent show type of thing and we won, and Gladys Knight was there as well as a guy named Bobby Taylor, and they told Motown about us, and Motown was interested in seeing us audition for them. So we went to Berry Gordy&rsquo;s mansion, estate, in Detroit &ndash; indoor pool &ndash; and all the Motown stars were there &ndash; the Supremes, the Temptations, the Marvelettes, the Miracles &ndash; and we auditioned and they loved it, and Diana Ross came over to us special after the concert we did for them and she kissed us all and said we were marvelous and she said she wanted to play a special part in our career and that&rsquo;s how it started.

Berry Gordy, as the world knows, owns Motown Records, and he only managed two people in the whole history of Motown - there was The Supremes and The Jackson 5. And so he was the main force behind us as well as my father and mother.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JANET: If it Motown was a school, what things did you learn?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: I learned about producing, I learned how to, erm, to cut a track as well as producing. I learned about writing and just the whole overall thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Being with Stevie Wonder, being in his sessions... just sitting in and learning was incredible. Just the way a producer dictates to me. Just the greatest learning point, wonderful. It was the best school.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JANET: Was Motown like a big family?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MICHAEL: Er, yes, that&#39;s very true. They were. Everybody worked together. You&#39;d be doing a session and Berry Gordy would just walk in and change things around and nobody would get mad.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was like the Disney studios. Walt Disney would go from one studio to the other and just stimulate everybody, like a bee, you know, and pollen, just going from one place to another and stimulating people, keeping them on the right track.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Berry was wonderful at taking a song and leading it to the right direction to make it a hit. He knew just what it takes. And everybody can&#39;t do that. He&#39;s something.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JANET: Since a lot of people were telling you how to do your songs and things, was it frustrating to you? </span></p></body>
