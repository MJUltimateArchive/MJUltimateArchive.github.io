		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Hit Parader&quot; Magazine Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that The Jacksons were &ldquo;mixing their new single&rdquo; for their upcoming &ldquo;Triumph&rdquo; album, which implies that the album&rsquo;s release was imminent; the album was released on September 26, 1980.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Hit Parader&rdquo; magazine (February 1980) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115137/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/jacksonsmakemoves.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ever since 1976, when Michael Jackson and four of his brothers left Motown and signed with Epic, they&#39;ve been talking about producing themselves. Encouraged by Stevie Wonder&#39;s phenomenal success with his self-produced &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;, The Jacksons felt that they didn&#39;t need an outside producers or other writers. Especially after being around studios making records for more than ten years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It wasn&#39;t until their third Epic album, Destiny, that they were finally given the chance and they didn&#39;t waste a minute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Calling from his California home where he and brothers Jackie, Marlon, Tito, and Randy were mixing their new single and recording another album, Michael talked about their big chance and said: &quot;Oh God, am I thankful for the opportunity. We knew that we could do it if we had the chance and the results show that we were right.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;Our persistence in not giving up, continually telling the record company that we didn&#39;t want other writers was what finally changed their minds&quot;, says Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Producing their first album wasn&#39;t difficult, says Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You&#39;ve got to remember, I&#39;ve been around studios since I was a child and I&#39;ve just picked it up. You learn, you watch... I&#39;d sit in on Stevie&#39;s sessions and just be amazed. He&#39;d sit there and do everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also records on his own and his album, &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, is equally successful. Produced by Quincy Jones (&quot;The Wiz&quot;), the album contains material written by Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Carole Bayer Sager, Louis Johnson, Tom Bahler, and Rod Temperton (of Heatwave fame), in addition to his self-penned hit, &quot;Don&#39;t Stop &#39;Til You Get Enough&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Why did Michael go outside the family?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I felt there are still so many different things I want to learn that I didn&#39;t want to go in by myself and do it. I wanted to watch a giant and learn from him. That&#39;s why I wanted to work with Quincy. He&#39;s the kind of guy who&#39;s unlimited musically. Classical, jazz, disco, soul, pop, he&#39;s done operas, movie soundtracks, he&#39;s worked with all the greats--he can do everything. He can work with me and do anything I want.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I wanted an album that wouldn&#39;t just consist of just one kind of music &#39;cause I love all kinds of music. I see it all as music, I don&#39;t like to label it--it&#39;s like saying this child is white, this one&#39;s black, this one&#39;s Japanese, but they&#39;re all children. It reminds me of prejudice. I hate labels, it&#39;s so crazy.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While Michael prefers recording his own material, he enjoys doing other people&#39;s and says, &quot;If somebody has a wonderful song that&#39;s right for me, I&#39;d love to do it. I wouldn&#39;t pass up a good song just because I didn&#39;t write it. On The Jacksons&#39; albums we write all the songs, but I enjoy hearing other people&#39;s material. I really do, I think it&#39;s so much fun hearing things that I didn&#39;t write and I think, &#39;How did you write this, how did you do that?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That&#39;s what I enjoy most about doing solo albums: you get to see how different people work in the studio. With The Jacksons, we&#39;re just doing our own thing in our little private world. That&#39;s one of the reasons I didn&#39;t want The Jacksons to produce my album--I don&#39;t want the same sound because mine is different.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After all this time, Michael still enjoys the music, but would like to devote more time to his first love: making films.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I had the time of my life making &#39;The Wiz&#39;&quot;, he says. &quot;It was an experience I&#39;ll never forget.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;m just dying to do the next film. It&#39;s really killing me, and when I say killing me, I really mean it. Sometimes I could just scream. I&#39;m so busy with other things and what I really want to do more than anything is films.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Film will last forever. I can go on tour and it&#39;s exciting, but when it&#39;s done, it&#39;ll be lost to the world, but if I do a movie, it&#39;s there forever. That&#39;s what I love about films--they&#39;re something captured, a moment captured that&#39;ll be there for eternity. The stars die, like Charlie Chaplin--he&#39;s gone, but his films will be here forever. If he did Broadway and plays while he was alive, he would have been lost to the world. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not too crazy about doing plays even though I love the theater. I think of records the same way.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has no interest in doing a frivolous movie, he prefers more serious subject matter, like &quot;The Wiz&quot;. &quot;I think it had such deep truths in it&quot;, he says. &quot;You talk about belief and faith--these are strong subject matters and when you do something like that, it&#39;ll last forever.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Group albums, solo plans, movies--Sounds like an awful lot for any one person to tackle. But it&#39;s no problem for Michael, &quot;I can record by myself and with my brothers, but when it comes to films, I&#39;ll have to set time aside&quot;, he says. &quot;I always do things through force and feeling, and I always follow my instincts. If it&#39;s meant to be it&#39;ll come, it&#39;ll happen. It will make itself known.&quot;</span></p></body>
