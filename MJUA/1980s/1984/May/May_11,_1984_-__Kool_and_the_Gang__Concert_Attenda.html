Michael dressed in full costume for the event&ndash;coming in blackface, with a pasted-on beard&ndash;the whole nine yards. But things were never the same between us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/michael-jacksons-ultimate-disguise-never-405525"><span class="cs8567212B">The Daily Mirror</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At first glance you wonder what beaming young actress Tatum O&rsquo;Neal sees in her older date, his features obscured by a huge afro and bushy beard.But the eyes are the giveaway &ndash; beneath the elaborate disguise is a 24-year-old Michael Jackson, hoping to enjoy a concert with his first girlfriend in blissful anonymity.The 1982 snap documents one of the many &ldquo;crazy nights&rdquo; Tatum, then 18, says she shared with Jackson. And while the singer came to be mocked for the crazy disguises he adopted, this one was clearly a work of genius.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the snap resurfaced recently, a now 45-year-old Tatum told pals: &ldquo;We were going to a Kool And The Gang concert, but Michael didn&rsquo;t want to be spotted. &ldquo;He got a special effects guy to help. We had an amazing night. No one recognised us, but we did get some strange looks as he appeared so much older than me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A Jackson insider reckoned the get-up &ndash; put together by Oscar-winning special effects artist Rick Baker, who worked on the Thriller video &ndash; cost thousands of dollars.They added: &ldquo;Michael loved it. He thought it was so much fun. Rick created this beard and did some work on Michael&rsquo;s lips. He also gave him make-up to make his skin darker.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BAwPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TIQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6969,2835757&amp;dq=michael+jackson+tatum-o-neal&amp;hl=en"><span class="cs8567212B">The Deseret News</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The photo was snapped by an employee at the Helmsley Palace, where Jackson was staying. The Palace paparazzo, who is accepting bids until October at a Bronx post office box, tells Eavesdropping that Jackson paid $10,000 for the get up.</span></p></body>
