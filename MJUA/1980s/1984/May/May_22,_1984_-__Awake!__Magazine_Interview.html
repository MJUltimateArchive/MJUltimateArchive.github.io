Evidently not wanting viewers to conclude that it promoted spiritism, the film begins with the disclaimer: &ldquo;Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this film in no way endorses a belief in the occult. &mdash; Michael Jackson&rdquo;. Nevertheless, it was so realistic that some who saw it admitted that they were horrified at first. What was this short film intended to convey? And how does the performer, Michael Jackson, feel about it in looking back? &ldquo;I would never do it again!&rdquo;, says Jackson. &ldquo;I just intended to do a good, fun short film, not to purposely bring to the screen something to scare people or to do anything bad. I want to do what&rsquo;s right. I would never do anything like that again.&rdquo; Why not? &ldquo;Because a lot of people were offended by it&rdquo;, explains Jackson. &ldquo;That makes me feel bad. I don&rsquo;t want them to feel that way. I realize now that it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea. I&rsquo;ll never do a video like that again!&rdquo; He continues: &ldquo;In fact, I have blocked further distribution of the film over which I have control, including its release in some other countries. There&rsquo;s all kinds of promotional stuff being proposed on Thriller. But I tell them, &lsquo;No, no, no. I don&rsquo;t want to do anything on Thriller. No more Thriller&rsquo;&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105309/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/wanna6.html"><span class="cs8567212B">New York Post (1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s turnaround is contained in the latest issue of &ldquo;Awake!&rdquo;, the official publication of the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses.

Faced with the threat, he said, the singer renounced his popular &#39;&#39;Thriller&#39;&#39; video in the May 22 issue of Awake!.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...According to his mother, Katherine, Mr. Jackson regularly dons a disguise to proselytize on street corners, distributing copies of The Watchtower and Awake!. At the same time, perhaps more than anyone else he exemplifies the music, videos, fashion and much else that is frowned upon by the hierarchy of his church. A &#39;Thriller&#39; Disclaimer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Norman Winter, a press agent for Mr. Jackson in Los Angeles, declined to discuss the singer&#39;s religious beliefs or the authenticity of the quote in Awake!.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &#39;&#39;Thriller&#39;&#39; video, in which Mr. Jackson is transformed into a werewolf and spirits in a graveyard come to life, begins with a disclaimer that says the film does not mean to imply a belief in the occult. The statement is consistent with the Witnesses&#39; position against demons, devils and magic. The video, distributed as &#39;&#39;Making Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller,&#39;&#39; has sold 800,000 copies, making it the world&#39;s best-selling video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gary Botting, another former Witness, said the leadership was reluctant to alienate Mr. Jackson. Mr. Botting and his wife, Heather, wrote &#39;&#39;The Orwellian World of the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses,&#39;&#39; which compares the Witness faith with the mind-regulating vision in Orwell&#39;s &#39;&#39;Nineteen Eighty-Four.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said the leadership was reluctant because Mr. Jackson helped bring contributions and credibility to the faith by what many consider his exemplary habits, including abstinence from sex, liquor and drugs.</span></p></body>
