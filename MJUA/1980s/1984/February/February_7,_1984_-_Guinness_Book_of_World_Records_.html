I started at 5 years old touring with my brothers, The Jackson 5, and still I feel like I&rsquo;ve just begun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do great things and achieve many things but for the first time in my entire career I feel like I have accomplished something because I&rsquo;m in the Guinness Book of World Records.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m deeply &mdash; I&rsquo;m so honored and deeply touched by it and I thank you all. And I also thank CBS Records, which is the best record company in the world and Walter Yetnikoff, who is the best record company president in the world. And thank you all. You are all wonderful people. I&#39;m very embarrassed but thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As modest Michael relinquished the mike, Yetnikoff grabbed it, beaming and blushing. &ldquo;We have a little surprise,&rsquo; he began. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m the best record company president in the world but Michael is sure the best artist in the world.&rdquo; He continued: &ldquo;Michael just got a presentation for the best solo performer of all times. I&rsquo;m reading from The Guinness Book of Records. The best gelling album of all time is Saturday Night Fever with 25 million copies globally. I have news for you. Today, we surpassed 25 million copies for &quot;Thriller&quot;! Michael Jackson -- the number one artist in the world!&quot;, Yetnikoff shouted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brooke Tells Of Love</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, with the recording of Michael&rsquo;s hot-selling Billie Jean blaring through the loudspeakers, Brooke Shields bounced onto the stage and hugged the handsome hero to millions and the superstar with whom she shares a special friendship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They held hands and bowed to the beat. She smiled proudly during Michael&rsquo;s moment on music&rsquo;s mountaintop just as she had done several weeks ago when she flew 3,000 miles from Princeton University, where she is a freshman student, to be at his side when he became the first entertainer ever to receive eight American Music Awards in Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This time, she was within a short driving distance from Princeton, NS, where she took time out from studying for an exam to again be at the singer&rsquo;s side when he received unprecedented honors in nearby New York City.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After getting permission from the university and her mother Teri, who is also her manager, to be with Michael at the Music Awards show on the West Coast, Brooke explained that she was responding to his invitation. Her mother told reporters that her actress/model daughter idolizes Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brooke further explained the special friendship in a WCBS-TV interview upon her arrival for the black-tie party in the museum that CBS Records had chosen because of Michael&rsquo;s love for animals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;How did this all come about that you became Michael Jackson&#39;s date for tonight? Was it his idea, your idea or a press agent&rsquo;s idea?&rdquo; TV newsman James Brady asked. She responded:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well, it has nothing to do with press agents. Michael and I have been friends for a very long time. We&#39;ve never made it public for any reason.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love Michael dearly. I went to the American Music Awards and that was really the first time we ever went out in public together. I talk to him all the time and he said that he would really like to have me go with him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reminded that when she walks into a room that she is usually the most celebrated person there, Brady wanted to know how she would feel taking a back seat to Michael on his night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I try not to be too conscious about anything wherever I go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But when I&rsquo;m with Michael I feel so good, especially tonight, because it is his night. I&#39;m proud to be his friend and I feel lucky to be able to enjoy it with him,&rdquo; the 20-year-old beauty remarked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In an exclusive interview with Jet, Mrs. Teri Shields elaborated upon her daughter&#39;s special friendship with ichael, who has inspired Brooke to take singing lessons &mdash; and she would love one day to do a duet with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Smiling as she got up from beside two of Michael&rsquo;s beautiful sisters, Janet and LaToya, and talking to Jet within an earshot of their parents Joseph and Katherine Jackson, Mrs. Shields said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh, God, everybody is pretty tonight. We&rsquo;re just happy to be here because it&rsquo;s a nice thing for Michael, and his whole family is just so beautiful. No question about that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Brooke and Michael have been friends for a couple of years,&rdquo; she revealed. &ldquo;And it seems that it&rsquo;s a sudden thing and it&rsquo;s not a sudden thing. You know how some people look at things and it&rsquo;s not that way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They have a quiet friendship and she just wants to share and hopefully give him support, too, as far as a friend is concerned. I think that&rsquo;s very hard in this business at times&mdash;and I think his mom&#39;s real cute, too,&rdquo; she shifted and nodded toward Mrs. Jackson. The beautiful mother of the Jackson clan smiled politely as if she heard the compliment, though she didn&rsquo;t. Her sons, except for Jermaine, and her daughters were on the scene to share Michael&rsquo;s success and contemplate their future together as recording and performing artists.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;This evening means a lot of success,&rdquo; said guitarist Tito Jackson as he separated himself from his musical clan to talk to Jet. &ldquo;The (Jackson) brothers are in the studio and will be coming out with an album followed by a worldwide tour,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that will mean a lot of fun, getting out there and doing the things that we know how to do best &mdash; doing it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What inspires me most is just a big family and lots of music, happy family &mdash; and love of course.&rdquo; He said of the recording session that they would be returning to complete, &ldquo;We have about 20 songs that we are going to pick from. They are a smashes, we feel. I wrote a couple and so did the other brothers. What songs that will be on the album, I&rsquo;m not certain, but the title of the album is Victory. I can&rsquo;t recall who named it, but we feel that we challenged a long road and hit a lot of bumps in it, but the main point is we see the finish line.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the interviews shifted from the VIP reception area to the area of the museum where animals are on exhibit, Michael and Brooke, hand-in-hand, led the tour and mingled with celebrity guests.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He carried with him a special bound copy of The Guinness Book Of World Records, which had been presented him earlier by Norris McWhirter, editor of the Guinness Book, who said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We stopped the presses for him (Michael) at 23 million. But now he is already on 24 (million). It&rsquo;s just one other record which I think he ought to break &mdash; the world&rsquo;s record for the world&rsquo;s fastest tap dancer at 1,440 strikes per minute. It&rsquo;s there for the breaking and he says he can do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some of his notable guests stopped him to witness the entry of his achievements in the book. They, too, showered him with praise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Video rock star Carly Simon called him a genius and lauded his musicianship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mary Tyler Moore said what startles her about Michael&#39;s talent is that he had no training.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nick Ashford and his wife Valerie Simpson, who are responsible for some smash hits by artists like Gladys Knight and The Pips and some famous Motown artists, said they want to grow up and be like Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They bordered on similarity of thoughts of Michael&rsquo;s brother, Marlon, who co-wrote a song about children with his superstar sibling.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marlon, like Michael, loves children. &quot;We wrote a song called &#39;Be Not Always&#39; and it&#39;s about children&quot;, Marlon said. &ldquo;We just have this thing about kids,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;We should listen to what children have to say... They don&rsquo;t have a racial problem. They don&rsquo;t know Black and White. They just love and get vibes from love,&rdquo; Marlon observed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the Michael Jackson love fest was winding down, his father Joseph had some reflections about the evening and the future.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&#39;m very proud of the announcement that Michael has achieved the highest position that any artist can be&mdash;and that&rsquo;s No. 1 in the world. That makes me real happy to see that,&rdquo; he said. The father who launched the career of his children and gave them professional guidance to the top says the future will bring some changes in their professional relationship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&rsquo;s no truth to reports that Michael has fired him as his manager. &ldquo;I had a contract and it was up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the contract was never picked up by all the group (The Jacksons), not just Michael... I&rsquo;m not holding that against no one. But I do hope that Michael and the rest of the boys follow along the directions that I&rsquo;ve trained them all through the years. I&#39;ll still sort of be overseeing what they&rsquo;re doing to help them be much better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As an overseer, father Jackson faces a bright financial future with his sons. He will be one of the promoters of the upcoming Victory Tour 1984 which will be sponsored by Pepsi Cola. &ldquo;We&#39;ve got some great guarantees and some great offers for this tour and we hope it will be successful,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don King, who is a promotional partner for the tour, waxed with enthusiasm: &ldquo;I think this is a wonderful experience to be on the Victory Tour with the Jacksons. I&rsquo;m fabulously excited about being with Joe Jackson, who has been steadfast, tenacious and really together in trying to hold this thing together where some Blacks can have an opportunity to participate in the main stream of the American economy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">King said that he was especially pleased with the contract and &ldquo;we will perform&mdash;Joseph, Katherine and I, It&rsquo;s a joint venture between us and we have the hottest group in the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael could make the group the hottest ever next Tuesday. That&rsquo;s the date he also could make Grammy history by winning 10 awards at the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences 26th annual awards ceremony in Los Angeles. His unprecedented 12 nominations (he competes against himself for two songwriting awards) came in 10 of 67 categories in which Grammys are being presented.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But those who tune to CBS expecting to see Michael constantly going to the podium accepting awards will be disappointed &mdash; even if he wins everything he can. Only a dozen or so of the 67 awards will be seen live on TV. And only a few of that dozen are categories in which Jackson was nominated. The remainder of the awards are handed out hurriedly just before airtime.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the scene that viewers saw at the American Music Awards where he would accept a trophy and then return to his seat where Brooke Shields sat beside him will not be repeated. However, if Princeton and her parent give her permission, she will likely be at the superstar&rsquo;s side because of their special friendship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;She&#39;s gorgeous and she&rsquo;s something special to me,&rdquo; Michael says of their relationship. He&rsquo;s not the kind to kiss and tell so he only revealed that they talk a lot on the phone and they have tremendous times together whenever their schedules permit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Both Michael and Brooke have been romantically linked to other celebrities. He has been linked romantically with actress Tatum O&#39;Neal, who was also a constant telephone companion. Suitors who pursued Brooke include Prince Albert of Monaco and Mohammed Hhashoggi, an Arab oil heir and playboy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Neither wants the public to read more into their friendship because they are more devoted to their careers&mdash;although they will probably follow the beckoning of their hearts more than their heads.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Both say they are comfortable in the relationships with their family homesteads but will continue cultivating their special friendship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/08/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-232644.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; (February 8, 1984)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524152635/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/08/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-232644.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson, still recovering from burns suffered while filming a commercial in Los Angeles, was given awards from his record company and the Guinness Book of World Records last night at the American Museum of Natural History for his hugely successful album, &#39;&#39;Thriller.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Jackson, wearing a black military jacket and jeans, arrived onstage along with 32 dancers and amid a shower of confetti, which landed mostly on the 1,500 formally dressed guests.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Accompanying Mr. Jackson was Brooke Shields, the actress.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;Thriller&#39;&#39; has sold at least 25 million copies, more than any other solo album, according to Walter Yetnikoff, the president of CBS Records. President Reagan and Mayor Koch sent congratulations, and Manhattan Borough President Andrew J. Stein designated yesterday &#39;&#39;Michael Jackson Day.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some 500 fans stood outside the museum and more than a hundred policemen were on hand for crowd control. Some 150 private security men were on duty inside.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Others who attended the celebrity- studded ceremony included the actress Joan Collins; the real estate developer Donald Trump and his wife, Ivana; and the designer Calvin Klein, who said Mr. Jackson had walked up to him and confided, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m wearing your jeans, Mr. Klein.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105434/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/rightingonn84.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Rock &amp; Soul&quot; magazine (August 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Three days later, while the public wondered about the severity of the burns, Epic Records sent invitations printed on the palm of Michael&#39;s trademark white gloves to a my exclusive list of people. Epic rented out the American Museum of Natural History for the bash, and Michael promised to be there. Instantly, the glove became the hottest and most talked about &quot;ticket&quot; in town.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, a bodyguard/security chief well known in New York for specializing in music-oriented affairs cased out the museum for three hours, devising routes Michael and his family could safety utilize to avoid the masses. No, said Michael. The Thriller insisted he would walk through the front door to show his fans he was okay, that despite the rumors, he was not seriously injured in the Los Angeles incident.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The event was &quot;black tie&quot;, meaning guests were to wear tuxedos and gowns. For many of the invitees, this was their first formal affair, and so they rented outfits for the occasion. Others instead decided to wing it with creative adaptations of formal wear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The daily media reports swore a star-studded gathering would attend the gala, but few biggies were spoiled. We saw Joan Jett, Herbie Hancock, Andy Warhol, Donald Trump, Sylvia Miles, Gloria Gaynor, Nona Hendryx, Francesco Scavullo, Steve Winwood, the B-52&#39;s and others. Not in attendance were Diana Ross, Liza Minnelli, Jane Fonda, Quincy Jones, and other really big stars Michael says are his close friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We also saw bite size servings of the blandest guacamole and curried chicken, but no banquet, despite the party&#39;s reported $250,000 budget. The hors d&#39;oeuvre were calculated the 5 some way Epic&lsquo;s marketing experts packaged &quot;Thriller&quot;, like Michael&lsquo;s music, the food was prepared not to offend a tranquil majority who want nothing too sharp or too flat. We&#39;ve eaten better at Egg Roll Express.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A troupe of young dancers set the excitement for Michael&rsquo;s entrance. Epic execs then immediately bored the gathering with the all-too-familiar corporate pats-on-the-back. A representative from the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; that, for the first time in history, hts company stopped the presses to file a new entry; Thriller&#39;s many record-breaking triumphs had been recorded, and so Michael was presented with the first bound copy of the book, hot off the press.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You know&quot;, the superstar told his guests, &quot;I&#39;ve been performing for nearly 20 years now. I started when I was five years old with my brothers. Yet, I feel like it&#39;s just begun. For the first time ever, I feel like I&#39;m really successful since I finally made the Guinness book.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael then retreated to a V.I.P. room, never to be seen again by his guests, and this caused consternation among some of the invited. Some quizzed as to why they were invited if Michael was going to be somewhere else all night. After all, tux rentals are costly! Were we all invited just for show? Michael reportedly left the museum after awhile, and headed for the Limelight, New York&lsquo;s newest and most extravagant discotheque.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Invitation on white glove, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjjcollectors.com/index.php?option=com_acymailing&amp;ctrl=archive&amp;task=view&amp;listid=1-mailinglist&amp;mailid=54-mjjcollectors-exclusive-thriller-party-invitation-glove"><span class="cs8567212B">MJJCollectors listing</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190917172026/http://www.mjjcollectors.com/index.php?option=com_acymailing&amp;ctrl=archive&amp;task=view&amp;listid=1-mailinglist&amp;mailid=54-mjjcollectors-exclusive-thriller-party-invitation-glove"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Walter Yetnikoff ...Invite You To A Michael Jackson THRILLER Party 2/7/84, 9 p.m. American Museum Of Natural History...Black Tie, RSVP Susan Blond, Epic Records...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Star&rdquo; magazine (March 3, 1984)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Invited</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...[Michael] insists emphatically: I&#39;m no Mr. Nutter.

As a result, CBS Records is taking no chance of offending its biggest asset. Anxious to please Jackson, the company threw a big bash for him this month at New York&#39;s American Museum of Natural History. &quot;We wanted to show our gratitude&quot;, explained one top company executive. &quot;Michael Jackson is the largest egg in our product basket.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103407/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/rs.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Right On!&rdquo; magazine (June 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By now you&#39;ve probably heard a lot about that famous party CBS Records gave for Michael Jackson at the Museum of Natural History. But there&#39;s one thing about that party you probably haven&#39;t heard. It was BORING. It would have been fun only if you enjoy battling through hundreds of people for a glimpse of Michael Jackson. But, believe me, that was no fun. First off all, the party was too big--1,500 people. And the food wasn&#39;t great either. The party cost $250,000, but they obviously didn&#39;t spend much of it on food. In a party that crowded, it&#39;s hard to have fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were a lot of stars there, but a lot of them left early. In fact, many people left early. Quite a few of the guests were headed to other parties. Many of those parties were in trendy restaurants. It was more fun party-hopping after Michael&#39;s party than it was attending his party. You had to feel sorry for all those fans standing in freezing weather behind police barricades outside the Museum. The &quot;out&quot; crowd was watching the &quot;in&quot; crowd go to the party. Well, the &quot;out&quot; crowd shouldn&#39;t feel bad. They didn&#39;t miss much.</span></p></body>
