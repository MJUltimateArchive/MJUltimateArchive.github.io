This recognition also brings with it a responsibility to one&#39;s admirers throughout the world. Performers should always serve as role models who set an example for young people. It saddens me that many may actually believe the present flurry of false accusations. To this end, and I do mean END: NO! I&#39;ve never taken hormones to maintain my high voice; NO! I&#39;ve never had my cheekbones altered in any way; NO! I&#39;ve never had cosmetic surgery on my eyes. YES! One day in the future I plan to get married and have a family.

Frank Dileo &ndash; in dark sunglasses and with a cigar in his mouth &ndash; stepped in front of a podium to announce that he was about to read a two-page statement from Michael, &lsquo;who, as you all know, has risen to the pinnacle of success in his field.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a gruff, tough-guy voice, the burly manager read [the statement]... After reading the statement, Frank refused to answer questions from the assemblage of reporters, and left the podium.</span></p></body>
