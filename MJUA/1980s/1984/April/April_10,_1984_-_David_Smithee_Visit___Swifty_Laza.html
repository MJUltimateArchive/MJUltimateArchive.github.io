video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He pulled out his red letter jacket with the &quot;M&#39; on it at first, the one he used in the beginning of the &quot;Thriller&#39; video,&quot; David said. &quot;But then he pulled this one out and said I could have my choice.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David&#39;s mother said the keepsakes will be put into a vault for safekeeping.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Words cannot express how wonderful this dream was for us,&quot; Mrs. Karen Smithee said after she and David returned from the visit with Jackson at his Encino, Calif., home. &quot;The memories will be with us forever.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David, visibly fatigued by the trip, goes back to his doctor next week for treatment of the congenital disease that attacks the pancreas and can result in frequent respiratory infections.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The youngster&#39;s trip was made possible by the Brass Ring Society, founded last August in Tulsa by Ray Esposito to fulfill the wishes of youngsters battling potentially terminal illnesses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://newsok.com/article/2074306"><span class="cs8567212B">Oklahoman (July 11, 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A 14-year-old cystic fibrosis victim didn&#39;t live to see Michael Jackson in concert, but the boy&#39;s mother says a dedication on the singer&#39;s latest album is keeping her son&#39;s memory alive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A month before David Smithee died in May after a 13-year battle with the lung disease, he got one of his longtime wishes a visit with Jackson at the singer&#39;s California home, said David&#39;s mother, Karen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The trip was arranged by the Brass Ring Society, a Tulsa group dedicated to making dreams come true for terminally ill children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson gave David the rhinestone-studded glove he wore this year when he received a record eight Grammy awards, and the red jacket he wore in a rock video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The superstar also promised to send David tickets to one of the Jacksons&#39; concerts and to dedicate his hit song &quot;Beat It&quot; to the youth when he attended.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shortly after David&#39;s death May 28, Mrs. Smithee called Jackson&#39;s personal secretary and left a message that David had died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/jackson-s-kindness-recounted/article_ce369e0f-3cec-5663-b663-eded56602c1e.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Tulsa World (June 28, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Karen Wilson was traveling back to Tulsa from a business trip when she heard the news that Michael Jackson had died Thursday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It brought back some wonderful memories of my son and how special Michael Jackson treated him,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;His loss was terrible, and his death brought up a heavy heart.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was in 1984 when her 14-year-old son, David Smithee, who was terminally ill with cystic fibrosis, met Jackson at his California home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The visit was part of a weeklong California trip for David made possible by a nonprofit organization that fulfilled the dreams of terminally ill children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the afternoon visit at Jackson&#39;s Encino, Calif., home, David watched a movie with Jackson in his home theater, played video games and learned how to moonwalk.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of the video games, David told a Tulsa Tribune reporter, &quot;I played two games with him and beat him both times.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The visit was topped off with Jackson giving David the red leather jacket he had worn in the &quot;Beat It&quot; video and a beaded glove he had worn to the American Music Awards, where he collected eight awards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David wore the jacket and glove home on the plane to Tulsa, his mother recalled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was just in heaven,&quot; Wilson said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David, an eighth-grader at Nimitz Junior High School, went straight to the hospital after arriving home, his mother said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While in the hospital, David showed visitors the jacket, glove and pictures of himself and Jackson, Wilson said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David died one month later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael Jackson gave us the happiest last month of our lives,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;(David) died very happy.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The visit must have made an impact on Jackson, too; he later dedicated the Jackson 5&#39;s &quot;Victory&quot; album to David.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wilson continued to follow Jackson&#39;s career after her son&#39;s death. She remains an adamant defender of Jackson, who faced rumors and accusations of inappropriate behavior with children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Despite everything that was said of him later, we saw none of that,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I never, never, never believed any of it. He was alone with my son a lot and never did anything ever happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I never really believed any of that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wilson still has all the pictures and memorabilia from their visit with Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And she still has the jacket and glove.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They are under lock and key,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;But now they&#39;ve become too fragile to take out and touch too much.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ironically, Wilson was dancing to a Jackson song Wednesday night while at a convention during her business trip. The song gave her the opportunity to tell others about her son&#39;s meeting with Jackson. &quot;I still, when a Michael Jackson song comes on, my heart still pounds,&quot; Wilson said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Randy Taraborrelli, biographer, &ldquo;Michael Jackson: The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1984 it was Liza, not Michael, who received the coveted invitation to the 10 April party hosted by famed literary agent, Irving &lsquo;Swifty&rsquo; Lazar. Held every year right after the Academy Awards, the event had once been so prestigious that even big-name stars considered it an honour to be invited. Celebrities often instructed their publicists to hound &lsquo;Swifty&rsquo; for months in advance for an invitation. In 1984, the party was held at the Bistro in Beverly Hills. Guests included Orson Welles, Cary Grant, Jacqueline Bisset and Linda Evans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was obvious that no matter how famous Michael had become, in his heart he was just another star-struck fan. Judging from the expression on his face, his success didn&#39;t diminish his awe, but it did allow him to observe his idols up close. In return, the celebs fell all over themselves for a chance to meet Michael, a guy who had made only one movie (and that one a flop!).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael never strayed from Liza&#39;s side. Wearing one of his blue glitter military outfits, dark aviator shades, and the requisite rhinestoned glove, Michael looked around the room and probably couldn&#39;t help noticing that everyone was gawking at him. For her part, Liza strolled about proudly with Michael on her arm, as if to say, Yes, I&#39;m with Michael Jackson. What do you think of that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Let me have a scotch and Coca-Cola,&rsquo; Liza instructed the waiter. &lsquo;And Mr Jackson will have the same.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; Michael protested. &lsquo;I&#39;ll have a&hellip;&rsquo; He hesitated. &lsquo;I&#39;ll have an orange juice, please.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Oh, of course he will,&rsquo; Liza said. &lsquo;And so will I. With scotch.&rsquo; She laughed merrily.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The waiter walked away. &lsquo;Yoo-hoo,&rsquo; Michael meekly called out after him. &lsquo;No scotch in mine.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joan Collins sauntered over to the couple. &lsquo;Michael, my dear boy, how truly wonderful to see you.&rsquo; She embraced him warmly and winked at Liza, as if sharing a joke with her. Michael looked confused.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Quick, stand right next to him; let&#39;s get a picture.&rsquo; A woman shoved her husband next to Michael. &lsquo;This is for our daughter, Natasha,&rsquo; the man sheepishly explained. Michael, who has no doubt heard a similar line a thousand times before, nodded patiently.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Oh, by the way, my name is Michael Caine,&rsquo; said the actor after the photo was taken. The two shook hands as Caine&#39;s wife, Shakira, snapped another picture of them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joan Collins turned to a friend. &lsquo;You know, I must get the name of his plastic surgeon,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I simply adore his nose, don&#39;t you?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Johnny Carson, seated with his girlfriend Alexis Mass, took in the scene and walked over to Michael just as his orange juice was being served to him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Nice to see you, Michael,&rsquo; Carson said with a firm handshake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael seemed dazed. &lsquo;I&hellip; uh, gee, nice to see you again too, Mr Carson.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Call me John.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Oh, okay. Call me Mike.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Liza Minnelli grabbed Michael&#39;s hand. &lsquo;Now look, Johnny, he&#39;s my date,&rsquo; she told Carson with a big smile.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Wow! What a nice guy that Johnny Carson is,&rsquo; Michael was overheard saying as Liza dragged him away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Oh, yes, he&#39;s a dear,&rsquo; she agreed. &lsquo;Now we&#39;re going to call my father.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;We are?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Liza then led Michael off to a payphone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After Liza dialled the number, she began doing a soft-shoe dance routine and started singing, &lsquo;Forget your troubles, c&#39;mon get happy,&rsquo; she sang. She was feeling&hellip;good.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael laughed. &lsquo;I love being around you, you know that?&rsquo; he told her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Shhh,&rsquo; Liza said. Her father answered the phone. &lsquo;Daddy, listen, I want you to meet Michael Jackson.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; was apparently the question back to her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Why, he&#39;s a wonderful singer and one of my best friends,&rsquo; she explained. &lsquo;Now just say hello.&rsquo; A pause. &lsquo;Oh, Daddy, just say hello. Now, c&#39;mon&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She handed the phone to Michael. &lsquo;No, I can&#39;t,&rsquo; Michael protested, his hand over the mouthpiece.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Oh, but you must&rsquo; Liza insisted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;But he&#39;s my idol.&rsquo; Michael had always enjoyed director Vincente Minnelli&#39;s films.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Well, then say hello.&rsquo; Liza punched him on the arm playfully. &lsquo;He doesn&#39;t bite.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael took his hand off the mouthpiece. &lsquo;Hello, Mr Minnelli,&rsquo; he whispered. He listened for five seconds, his eyes darting left and right. With a giggle, he handed the phone back to Liza. &lsquo;God, he&#39;s so nice,&rsquo; Michael gushed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Liza got back on the phone. &lsquo;Now listen, Daddy. Put on your velvet jacket. We&#39;ll be over in twenty minutes.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Yes, I&#39;m bringing him over there.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A pause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Never mind what he&#39;s wearing.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another pause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Okay, he&#39;s wearing one sequined glove, all right? Now, are you satisfied?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael doubled over, laughing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Okay, then fine. Goodbye.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Liza and Michael pushed through the crowd and out the door to the waiting limousine, Jimmy Stewart was overheard saying, &lsquo;Well, there they go, Dorothy&#39;s little girl&hellip; and the Wiz.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">George McFarland, actor best known for his role as &ldquo;Spanky&rdquo; from &ldquo;Our Gang&rdquo;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5620e38ae4b015f422aed475/1554233713492-C51QFW4LNCPYEA64GA08/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLCN2ADjbM7Qyk249IwR1dMUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dqtBssQZa2ASFWj5uN7bfXj49p8nji6rpNN0iVdXl21BG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/SPANKY.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190911175254/https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5620e38ae4b015f422aed475/1554233713492-C51QFW4LNCPYEA64GA08/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLCN2ADjbM7Qyk249IwR1dMUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dqtBssQZa2ASFWj5uN7bfXj49p8nji6rpNN0iVdXl21BG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/SPANKY.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In 1984, I was at the Governor&rsquo;s Ball in Los Angeles following the Oscars&rdquo;, says McFarland, now a retired salesman, speaking from his home in Fort Worth, Texas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;A secretary asked if someone could come over to meet me.
