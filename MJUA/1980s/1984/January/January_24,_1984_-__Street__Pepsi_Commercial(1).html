He really knew what worked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&quot;Rock &amp; Soul&quot; magazine (Winter 1984)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The scene was similar to those on many other commercial shoots: a form of organized madness. But the energy on the set of Pepsi-Cola&#39;s newest commercials was electrifying. The most popular entertainers in the world--Michael Jackson and his five brothers--were there. And they were performing to the sound of a &quot;New Generation&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two spots the Jacksons completed in California this week have already been called &quot;historic&quot; and &quot;the most eagerly awaited television event since the Super Bowl.&quot; Making them took enormous amounts of time, energy, and commitment by a large and talented group of people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The work that went into these commercials is phenomenal&quot;, said Alan Pottasch, senior vice president of creative services for Pepsi-Cola. &quot;Especially when you consider the time pressures we were under.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With plans for the ads in the works since December, various production crews put in 8,000 man hours scouting locations and arranging for the shoots. &quot;People literally worked around the clock&quot;, Pottasch added. Seven days a week, non-stop.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finally, the &quot;Annie&quot; set at The Burbank Studios and the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles were selected as the two shooting locations. On these two sets, to the tune of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, Pepsi and The Jacksons set out to make advertising history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With filming underway, the hard work continued. The first two days were spent under glorious blue skies on Burbank&#39;s back lot, where Broadway&#39;s &quot;Tap Dance Kid&quot;, Alfonso Ribeiro, joined his idol, Michael Jackson, for a sizzling street dance. With Michael&#39;s five brothers and eleven of Alfonso&#39;s friends also dancing to Tony Award-winner Michael Peter&rsquo;s choreography, the number proved to be pure magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103407/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/rs.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Right On&rdquo; magazine (June 1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The second commercial is a street scene. The Jacksons meet a group of young kids who are dancing in the streets. Michael encounters a lad who is dressed like him and imitating his dance steps. The youngster featured in the commercial is a new friend of Michael&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s Alfonso Ribiero, who is currently starring on Broadway in &ldquo;The Tap Dance Kid&rdquo;. That is where Michael spotted the twelve-year-old dancing wonder.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tony Award-winning choreographer, Michael Peters, put together the high-energy street dance&hellip; The two commercial spots were both directed by music video wizard Bob Giraldi.</span></p></body>
