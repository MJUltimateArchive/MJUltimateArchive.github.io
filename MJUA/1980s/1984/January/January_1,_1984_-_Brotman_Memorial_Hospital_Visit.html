He had been particularly affected by one patient, twenty-three-year-old mechanic Keith Perry, who had suffered third-degree burns on 95 per cent of his body. Michael had had photos taken of himself holding the patient&#39;s hand, with his sequined glove on. When asked why he was wearing the glove, Michael responded, &lsquo;This way, I am never offstage.&rsquo; The photos were quickly distributed to the media.</span></p></body>
