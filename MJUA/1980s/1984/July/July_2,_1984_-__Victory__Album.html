		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Victory&quot; Album</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jermaine Jackson, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As far as I&#39;m concerned the &#39;State of Shock&#39; single was a mistake. The whole fiasco happened because it was decided that we had to have product to sell while we were on the road. As a result, a sub-standard Jacksons album was released, which damaged our reputation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Whelan, painter of &ldquo;Victory&rdquo; album cover, Profiles in History (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.antimusic.com/news/09/july/23Artist_Hopes_To_Cash_In_On_Michael_Jackson_.shtml"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My experience with Michael and the other Jackson brothers, while admittedly brief, was different from what I&#39;ve been reading in the papers or seeing on TV broadcasts. My recollection of Michael was as an articulate, considerate, soft spoken man, generous with his time and his compliments. His music has the power to unite us in sound, and I was fortunate to have had a part in the &quot;Victory&quot; album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Danbury-artist-Michael-Whelan-remembers-Michael-217787.php"><span class="cs8567212B">The News-Times (July 7, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When you work with people with great talent, you learn to take a certain amount of forcefulness, or big ego, for granted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But what artist Michael Whelan remembers about Michael Jackson was how unobtrusive he was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was both very quiet and very charismatic,&#39;&#39; Whelan said. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen that combination before.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Whelan&#39;s brush with Jackson came in the post-&quot;Thriller&#39;&#39; days, when Jackson reunited with his five brothers to tour as The Jacksons -- the original Jackson Five, plus brother Jermaine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Epic Records asked artists to send portfolios of their work so it could choose someone to design the cover of the group&#39;s &quot;Victory&quot; album, and Whelan submitted his.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I heard they put all the portfolios in a room, and Michael took a long time to look at them. He chose me.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whelan still has the original painting of the cover -- a dark blue sky, a whirling galaxy, and off to the side, a fantastic ruin. In the foreground are the six Jackson brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael asked me to put him behind his brothers, which was really generous,&#39;&#39; Whelan said. &quot;But at the same time, we wanted his glove and socks to glow. That was his trademark.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What Jackson wanted was the look Whelan used for Isaac Asimov&#39;s novel &quot;Foundation&#39;s Edge.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He liked the universe I painted for the book cover,&#39;&#39; Whelan said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also wanted the swirling, light-filled look of the night sky at the end of Steven Spielberg&#39;s movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Working in Danbury, Whelan did the background of the painting and sketched in the singer&#39;s&#39; figures. Then he and Audrey and their daughter, Alexa, and a babysitter booked a flight to Los Angeles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They missed their plane.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were on the Hutchinson River Parkway and it was flooded, so it was closed down,&#39;&#39; Whelan said. &quot;How do you get to the airport without being on the Hutchinson?&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Whelans finally got to the airport just as the doors to their flight shut tight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Audrey kept saying &#39;You don&#39;t understand. We have to go meet Michael Jackson.&#39; I don&#39;t think any of the airport people believed her.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Whelans then flew to San Francisco and got a connecting flight to Los Angeles. Their luggage continued on to Singapore. But in Los Angeles, there was a limo waiting to whisk them to the recording studio to meet the Jacksons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What the Whelans remember about the studio was just how huge the Jackson empire entourage was. Each of the brothers had a lawyer present. Epic Records had a lawyer on hand. Columbia Records, Epic&#39;s parent company, had its own lawyer there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In this sea of expensive hangers-on, they remembered Jackson as being terrific.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He treated us warmly and generously and without a bit of phoniness,&#39;&#39; Michael Whelan said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He talked to Alexa about her Cabbage Patch doll,&#39;&#39; Audrey Whelan said. &quot;We were all vegetarians, and I remember talking about how hard it is to go to some banquet and get a huge slab of prime rib on your plate.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Whelans spent about 10 days in Los Angeles -- long enough for Michael Whelan to capture the look of the Jackson brothers&#39; faces before returning to Connecticut to finish his work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whelan still has the art director&#39;s notes about the cover -- mostly about the clothing the six brothers should be wearing. They ended up performing in outfits modeled on those in the painting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Whelans said Tuesday that because Jackson was so quiet and decent with them, they always had trouble listening to [the false tabloid news that plagued him later in life].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They also saw how a very rich person, surrounded by yes-men, might have his view of reality severely warped.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I remember thinking, how can he not feel suffocated?&#39;&#39; Michael Whelan said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This was a man who was performing since he was the age of 5,&#39;&#39; Audrey Whelan said. &quot;How can we really know what his life was like?&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Sunday-Chat-with-Michael-Whelan-364140.php#next"><span class="cs8567212B">News-Times (February 13, 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The thing I did for Michael Jackson I painted on a stove in Hollywood and every little element in the painting they had -- it wasn&#39;t necessarily them as much as all the people around them, the PR people, the lawyers, the agents -- everybody had a say on what went into the album cover.</span></p></body>
