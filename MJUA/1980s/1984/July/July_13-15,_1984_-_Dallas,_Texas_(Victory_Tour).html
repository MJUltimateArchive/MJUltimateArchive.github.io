That is one very special kid,&quot; Winter said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Concert promoters gave Leroy tickets to the Friday concert and promised his family a limousine ride to Texas Stadium and a pre-show backstage meeting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But because of a mix up with the limousine, Leroy, dressed in a Michael Jackson outfit, arrived about 30 minutes after the concert started and missed the chance to meet the singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Leroy had been tired and irritable during the trip, but the moment a nurse propped him up on a pillow at the concert, his attitude changed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That&#39;s Michael. I can&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m really here,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the fascination soon wore off when the heat and noise at the stadium gave him a headache. Just as he was ready to leave in his ambulance, Winter sent a message that Jackson wanted to meet Leroy in his hotel room, Dr. Richard Guy LaMere said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You know, it was really moving. Here&#39;s Michael Jackson being very sincere, talking to this little boy. He wasn&#39;t aloof at all,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson signed Leroy&#39;s white glove, LaMere said, before the boy and his family left. The boy&#39;s father, Leroy Robinson, said Jackson asked the family to keep him posted on Leroy&#39;s condition.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve never seen him happier,&quot; Robinson said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;And after sleeping most of the day Saturday, Leroy woke up, ate two pancakes and asked for more&rdquo;, Robinson said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;s really taken a turn for the better since he saw Michael&quot;, his father said. &quot;They have taken the IV (intravenous) out of his arm and they&#39;re only going to put it in when he has to have medicine -- his spirits are so much higher.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson and his brothers, meanwhile, ended their three-day stand in Texas on Sunday night before another capacity crowd.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The group, which drew about 117,000 screaming fans to sweltering Texas Stadium in Irving, now were scheduled to take their 13-city Victory Tour to Jacksonville, Fla. later in the week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Among the 39,000 spectators Sunday night were several cast members of the prime-time television soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;, including Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray, Charlene Tilton and Priscilla Presley. Singer Lou Rawls also attended the concert.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">George McFarland, actor best known for his role as &ldquo;Spanky&rdquo; from &ldquo;Our Gang&rdquo;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://archive.org/details/michaeljacksonandgeorgemcfarland-unknown1984magazinearticle"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">, from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael] had the pleasure of meeting McFarland in 1984 at the Governor&rsquo;s Ball in Los Angeles after the Oscars. McFarland said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;A secretary asked if someone could come over and meet me. I was flabbergasted when it turned out to be Michael Jackson. I love his music. He&rsquo;s a very private person-so I told him I lived in the country, and he could hide out for a few days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few months later Michael took McFarland up on his invite and stayed for 3 days. It was during the period when Michael was touring with the Victory Tour. Michael would sleep most of the day as he was described by McFarland as a night person. When they spent time together McFarland said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;d watch television, or drive around Fort Worth, or just sit in the backyard and rap. And it took him almost two days to go through all scrapbooks &ndash; he&rsquo;s a real big &lsquo;Little Rascal&rsquo; fan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael also discovered while at McFarland&rsquo;s that they had both lived at the same house in California. It was when Michael was looking over some photos of the Little Rascals star that he recognised the bedroom he used to have. It seemed they both had the same one in the house.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">George McFarland, actor best known for his role as &ldquo;Spanky&rdquo; from &ldquo;Our Gang&rdquo;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5620e38ae4b015f422aed475/1554233713492-C51QFW4LNCPYEA64GA08/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLCN2ADjbM7Qyk249IwR1dMUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dqtBssQZa2ASFWj5uN7bfXj49p8nji6rpNN0iVdXl21BG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/SPANKY.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine article</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190911175254/https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5620e38ae4b015f422aed475/1554233713492-C51QFW4LNCPYEA64GA08/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLCN2ADjbM7Qyk249IwR1dMUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dqtBssQZa2ASFWj5uN7bfXj49p8nji6rpNN0iVdXl21BG6v6ULRah83RgHXAWD5lbQ/SPANKY.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In 1984, I was at the Governor&rsquo;s Ball in Los Angeles following the Oscars&rdquo;, says McFarland, now a retired salesman, speaking from his home in Fort Worth, Texas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;A secretary asked if someone could come over to meet me.

Then we&rsquo;d just relax.
