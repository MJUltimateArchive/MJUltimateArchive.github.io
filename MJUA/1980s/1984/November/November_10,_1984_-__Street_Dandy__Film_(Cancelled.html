The Geffen Co. intends to proceed with the project even if Jackson opts for his own concept or another script. No terms are being disclosed on the exclusive one-film deal, which developed out of a long personal friendship between Jackson and powerful show biz mogul David Geffen. If you do what you did last Saturday, you could formally consider the dramatic content of the movie until the Jacksons&#39; &quot;Victory Tour&quot; concludes in Los Angeles on Dec. 2. But the top candidate for his &quot;star vehicle&quot; is a Geffen Co. project long linked to Jackson on the Hollywood grapevine: &quot;Street-dandy&quot; the new screenplay by &quot;Flashdance&quot; creator Tom Hedley. The musical drama&#39;s young hero not modeled after Michael Jackson, Hedley stresses. The elusive Michael Jackson Movie Deal, Hollywood&#39;s most sought-after quarry in recent years, has been snared by the Geffen Film Co. Jackson will begin work next month on the story and music for a big-budget dramatic feature showcasing his singing, dancing and acting. The songs will be released on the Geffen label by CBS Records as Jackson&#39;s solo follow-up to &quot;Thriller,&quot; which has sold 35 million-plus copies to date. The 26-year-old pop star won&#39;t miss one of the most important moment - New York street performer who is &quot;literally finding his voice, both as a man and as an artist.&quot; Hedley likens the character to a &quot;silent movie character in a modern movie, a pop Charlie Chaplin.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">People Magazine, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://people.com/archive/take-one-vol-22-no-1/"><span class="cs8567212B">July 2, 1984</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson is talking with the David Geffen Co. about starring in a movie musical called Street Dandy, to be scripted by Tom (Flashdance) Hedley. &ldquo;The part could work brilliantly for Michael,&rdquo; says an official of the film company. &ldquo;The street dandy is a mime, a great dancer and a fashion sensation in the late &rsquo;80s. The film takes place in a New York caf&eacute; where everyone has a dream. The street dandy&rsquo;s dream is the most difficult to achieve. He&rsquo;s a boy learning to find his voice as a man.&rdquo; The producers say that doesn&rsquo;t mean Mr. Falsetto will be singing in a new key.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">LA Times, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-11/magazine/tm-13543_1_michael-jackson/6"><span class="cs8567212B">October 11, 1987</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One field that Jackson hasn&rsquo;t yet conquered is that of feature films--he hasn&#39;t made one since &quot;The Wiz.&quot; A much-publicized plan to star in a film of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; for Steven Spielberg came to nothing, as did a script brought to him by Lynda Obst when she worked for David Geffen, who had a movie development deal with Jackson. Titled &quot;Street Dandy,&quot; it was by &quot;Flashdance&quot; writer Tom Hedley. Obst, who co-produced &quot;Adventures in Babysitting,&quot; found the script &quot;wonderful&quot; but says it was considered a little too fanciful for Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808120854/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mjjmovies.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Black Beat&rdquo; magazine (1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...David Geffen, the man who runs the Geffen Company--an entertainment conglomerate that includes Geffen Records (Ray Parker, Jr. just signed a record contract there) and a movie and theatrical production wing--recently announced that his company is working with Michael on development of a script, tentatively being called &quot;Street Dandy&quot;, reportedly about this kid who is one hell of a dancer, coming to grips with being a man. In the script, one of the crucial points of the Street Dandy&#39;s life turns out to be learning to deal with the fact that his voice isn&#39;t getting deeper with age, like all of the other young men his age.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...As part of the deal, Michael would produce the music for the soundtrack, which would also be released as an album, of course. According to sources, no contracts have been signed as of yet, but the Geffen people maintain that they will produce the movie, whether or not Michael elects to star in the flick.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Robert Lawrence, Columbia Pictures vice president, Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael is one of the hottest stars in the world.
