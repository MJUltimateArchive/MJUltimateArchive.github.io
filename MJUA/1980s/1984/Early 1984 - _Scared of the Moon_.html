		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Scared of the Moon&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range confirmed by Buz Kohan in Mike Smallcombe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mike Smallcombe, author, Making Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the earliest completed demos was called &lsquo;Scared of the Moon&rsquo;, which Michael worked on in early 1984 with his friend, Buz Kohan. During this period the pair would often have lengthy phone conversations, carrying on late into the night. &ldquo;All kinds of things would come up in our conversations,&rdquo; Kohan recalls. &ldquo;Michael was going with Brooke Shields at the time, and one night he called me and told me about Brooke&rsquo;s sister; he said she was scared of the moon. And I said to him, &lsquo;Michael, that&rsquo;s where the word lunatic comes from, a lunatic is someone who is scared of the moon&rsquo;.&rdquo; Inspired by the conversation, Michael wrote a song about a girl being scared of the moon. He created the music with partial lyrics, before calling on Kohan to help him complete the song&hellip; Scared of the Moon [was] a song recorded in 1984, also with Kohan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank Cascio, friend, My Friend Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael told me that he wrote that track after having a dinner with Brooke Shields during which she told him that one of her half sisters was scared of the moon. He said, &ldquo;Can you imagine? Being scared of the moon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Damien Shields, writer/author, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.damienshields.com/scared-of-the-moon-the-little-song-that-could/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo; &ndash; The little song that could!</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the thirty-three songs that Jackson had written during the sessions that ultimately resulted in 1987&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; album was called &ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo;. It did not make the final cut and for many years remained unknown to fans and unreleased.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We used to record on tape,&rdquo; recalls Brad Sundberg &ndash; Jackson&rsquo;s longtime studio technical director and engineer. &ldquo;Big two-inch, 24-track tapes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Matt Forger, another of Jackson&rsquo;s longtime collaborators and studio engineers, recorded the original demo to &ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo; at Westlake Studios. Jackson, a true professional, laid down all the vocals in a single session.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They just did the background vocals, the lead vocal and the piano. That was it,&rdquo; adds Sundberg.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Then Matt broke the number one rule that you never break &ndash; he gave Michael the master tape. And once you hand anything to Michael Jackson you may as well just chuck it off a pier because you&rsquo;re never ever going to see it again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A month or two passed by after recording Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo; vocals, before Forger got a call from the engineer at Evergreen Studios.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The engineer was there at Evergreen, calling Matt, saying, &lsquo;Hey I&rsquo;ve got this Michael Jackson session for &lsquo;Scared Of The Moon&rsquo;. Michael is here and the string players are here but we don&rsquo;t have a tape. Can you run the tape over?&rsquo; And Matt&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have the tape&hellip; I gave it to Michael!&#39;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So they went back and forth for a while, trying to figure out what could be done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fortunately, Matt still had a cassette copy of the original session, so he drove the cassette over to Evergreen. It wasn&rsquo;t the original multitrack, but it was something.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They the proceeded to transfer the cassette tape onto the new multitrack, recorded the strings onto the multitrack, and then mixed it down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Now, from a recording engineer&rsquo;s standpoint that&rsquo;s just breaking every rule in the book,&rdquo; says Sundberg of their experiment. &ldquo;You can not take a vocal from a cassette and then put it back onto a multitrack and have it still sound that good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Cassettes always have a little bit of hiss or warble, and I told Matt that it&rsquo;s pure genius,&rdquo; continues Sundberg. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just absolutely amazing that it worked because that was the original vocal, and it was just a hokey, cute little song that Michael wanted to do &ndash; and we did dozens of those &ndash; we&rsquo;d do lots of little snippets where Michael would have an idea and we would do a demo. But how &lsquo;Scared Of The Moon&rsquo; came about technically shouldn&rsquo;t have worked, but it does. It was like the little engine that could. It&rsquo;s the little song that could.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo; was not selected for 1987&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; album, and did not re-surface until around 1999, shortly after Jackson commenced collaborative sessions for the &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There are things that just stuck in his mind,&rdquo; says Michael Prince &ndash; who worked extensively as one of Jackson&rsquo;s trusted studio engineers between 1995 and 2009.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sometimes he writes new songs, and sometimes he wants to bring up something from the past that he knows is an unpolished gem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I remember we did a little work on &lsquo;Scared Of The Moon&rsquo; for the &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; album, actually. And I remember Steve Porcaro joking, &lsquo;Oh that song again?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s so funny because I&rsquo;d never heard it before. But that&rsquo;s Michael&rsquo;s way of doing things &ndash; he always revisited some of his favorite stuff. He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we put this on our last album? Let&rsquo;s listen again. Can we make it any better?&rsquo; Sometimes it makes it on the album and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the end, the little work that was done on &ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo; during the &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; sessions was not applied to the pre-existing version of the song, and it went back into the vault in its pre-&lsquo;Bad&rsquo; state.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, in November 2004, Sony Music Entertainment&rsquo;s Epic Records released a career-spanning box set of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s finest work, consisting of both released and unreleased material. The set, called &lsquo;The Ultimate Collection&rsquo;, features a newly mixed version of &ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Matt Forger was fittingly called back to put the finishing touches on the track, which is justly listed on &lsquo;The Ultimate Collection&rsquo; as a &ldquo;demo&rdquo;. Forger&rsquo;s final mix includes the 24 tracks of strings, the original cassette vocal/piano and guitar tracks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite the demo being officially released on &lsquo;The Ultimate Collection&rsquo; four years earlier, Jackson still wasn&rsquo;t done with &ldquo;Scared Of The Moon&rdquo; in 2009.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It, along with many other tracks from different stages throughout his career, was featured in an extensive &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list Jackson never had the chance to action during his life. The handwritten note, seen below, details the titles of 28 songs he had hoped to &ldquo;finish&rdquo; (including &ldquo;Cheater&rdquo;; also from the &lsquo;Bad&rsquo; sessions &ndash; also released on &lsquo;The Ultimate Collection&rsquo;). The note was found taped to the King of Pop&rsquo;s bedroom wall at the time of his death, on June 25th 2009 &ndash; twenty-four years after that &ldquo;hokey&rdquo; little demo was recorded at Westlake Studios.</span></p></body>
