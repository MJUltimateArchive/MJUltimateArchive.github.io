Focus&rdquo; magazine (1984)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This year will be a banner year for Jackson, as he has been working on another solo album, a family album, the tour, and at least one film--possibly the long awaited &quot;Peter Pan&quot; by Steven Spielberg. In an exclusive interview, Michael gives us a glimpse into his future plans:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: How has the accident changed you, mentally?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I appreciate my life and my health, all that I have, more deeply and spiritually.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/CLASS: Were you scared, at the time? Did you think you were doomed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: When I had time to gather my wits, I knew God would protect me. But I was shook up, naturally.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Will there be a lawsuit vs. Pepsico?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I&#39;m not discussing that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: How do you camouflage the burnt spot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: There are things I can wear, and I don&#39;t go out all the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Do you still hope to play Peter Pan?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: That&#39;s what I want to do most. And working with Steven; I love his movies, and his imagination.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: What about the movies with Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda that have been discussed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: Each lady is going to do a movie on her own, and then, well, we&#39;ll have to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Is it true that the &quot;Thriller&quot; video was in its way a screen test?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: It put me on film. I mean, there it is. There I am. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d need to do a screen test. I did a movie (&quot;The Wiz&quot;, with Diana Ross) and I&#39;ve been filmed for television most of my life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Did &quot;The Wiz&quot;&#39;s failure disappoint you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I was sorry. Sorry for Diana, me, all of us. But that seems so long ago, now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: John Landis, currently on trial in connection with the allegedly accidental deaths in the film &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, directed &quot;Thriller&quot;. How do you feel about the trial?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: He&#39;s a good director. John is a good man. That&#39;s all I need to say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: There&#39;s a religiously-derived disclaimer at the start of &quot;Thriller&quot; about ESP and otherworldly beliefs. WHy did you put it there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: To explain that I don&#39;t endorse beliefs that have nothing to do with reality.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: But one man&#39;s reality...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: It&#39;s what I chose to do. It reflects *my* point of view.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: How do you feel about the gossip about your sex life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I don&#39;t listen to it. Or read it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Do you think most of the public imagine you&#39;re gay?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I think most people are smart enough to know you can&#39;t judge a book by its cover.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: But why the flamboyant touches like glittery socks or the silver glove?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: Because I like them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: It&#39;s true that most major stars are uniquely idiosyncratic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: People who want to be one of the crowd usually don&#39;t go into this for a living.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: There&#39;s also been much written about your being a Jehovah&#39;s Witness, and the displeasure of some top members of that sect with your public image.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: (Silence.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Are you very sheltered from outsiders, as has been claimed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I have to make the most of my time, and I do choose the people I&#39;m with.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: It&#39;s been said you now use go-betweens even when the second party is in the room with you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: And I have to waste time explaining that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Has your enormous and quick stardom of the last year affected you or changed your personality?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I&#39;m sure, to some extent, it has.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Are you on close terms with your brothers?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: But you&#39;re closer to your mother and sisters?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: We&#39;re very close.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Do you think, because of the unprecedented success of &quot;Thriller&quot;, there&#39;ll be a backlash amongst the public or in the media, against you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I haven&#39;t seen evidence of that. Especially with the accident. People have been incredible, and more than kind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: What about the nasty or made-up things printed, or being said by certain people, like comedian Joan Rivers (who said she was flattered, she, not Jackson, was chosen Harvard&#39;s Hasty Pudding Club&#39;s Woman of the Year)?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: There&#39;s always some evil and lies in the world. But everyone gets what they put into life, good or bad. The judgment will come to everyone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Does it bother you that whatever you do or say now attracts so much attention?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I&#39;m used to it. I grew up on the stage. I&#39;m comfortable around people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Are you and Diana Ross still extremely close?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: Always. She&#39;s my best friend. I love her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Do you have many friends your own age?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: Everyone I know is my friend. They are all ages and backgrounds. I don&#39;t discriminate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Will you ever do non-musical movies? Do you want to be a film actor?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: At this point, I see, I hear music everywhere in my life. I don&#39;t invent the music, I plug into it. It&#39;s something bigger than one individual. I don&#39;t want to stop the music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: Do you think you can top &quot;Thriller&quot;&#39;s success?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: I didn&#39;t try to achieve that degree of success. So, I won&#39;t try to top it. You can&#39;t always order the future, no matter how you approach it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RO/Class: How is your personal life? Is there someone special?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson: It&#39;s wonderful, and I *am* in love...</span></p></body>
