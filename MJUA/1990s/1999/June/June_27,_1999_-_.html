But the 70,000 screaming fans packed inside Munich&rsquo;s sold-out Olympic Stadium that night had no idea he had just cheated death. They were all too caught up in the spectacle that was Michael Jackson &amp; Friends, a televised extravaganza with elaborate staging.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While his fame in America had waned since child abuse allegations cut short his Dangerous tour in 1993, Jackson&rsquo;s &lsquo;96-&rsquo;97 HIStory trek played to a record 4.5 million spectators, grossing more than $165 million. But only a few of those 82 concerts were staged in the United States. Taping this all-star concert in Germany was Jackson&rsquo;s way of showing gratitude to the loyal European subjects who still revered him as the same King of Pop who sold more than 51 million copies of 1982&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a greatest hits medley, Jackson launched into an 11-minute version of his green anthem &ldquo;Earth Song,&rdquo; which would culminate with a tank rolling on stage and Jackson standing in its path like a protester from Tiananmen Square. &ldquo;Where did we go wrong?&rdquo; he wailed from atop a metal platform 30 feet above the stage. &ldquo;What about us?&rdquo; a mighty choir answered as the audience wept and cheered. And then, somewhere in mid-song, the wires supporting the sturdy platform snapped.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The local crew evidently put the wrong cable wire on the metal and the bridge came crashing down into the orchestra pit with Michael on it,&rdquo; recalls the show&rsquo;s producer Kenny Ortega, who would go on to direct Jackson&rsquo;s critically-acclaimed concert documentary </span><span class="cs43C038A">This Is It</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. &ldquo;Michael felt the fall. He knew it was happening and timed his jump as the bridge hit the ground,&rdquo; Ortega says, incredulous. &ldquo;And he continued to do the show!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The scrambling stagehands and tour executives were horrified. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you trembling in fear?&rdquo; Ortega asked him minutes after the gig. Jackson responded like he was reading a script from one of those endearingly cheesy 1930s&rsquo; musicals: &ldquo;Well, Kenny, I always was taught that the show must go on.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
