I feel to reap and enjoy the fruits of my talents for myself would be selfish, irresponsible and unconscionable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;In these days of such abundance and advancement in what we can do, it pains me to think we do so little for our children. In some ways I feel undeserving to receive an award for something that is my duty. I accept this award as a gesture of the courage of the people of India and as a commission to do more for mankind.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The singer, who organizers said received no remuneration for his appearance, is currently recording a new album, and will ring in the millennium with a performance in Hawaii this New Year&#39;s Eve.</span></p></body>
