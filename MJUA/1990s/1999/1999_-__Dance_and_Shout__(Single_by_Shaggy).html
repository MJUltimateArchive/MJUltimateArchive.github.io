And one phone call and he said, &#39;Yeah, I already heard it and I think it&#39;s dope. You got it,&#39; and he was cool, too. He actually gave me a piece of the action. There were people that I&#39;ve used samples with that just wanted everything. He basically was, like, &#39;Hey, go ahead, man.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/81891/Read"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Music-News.com&rdquo; (July 17, 2014)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151225075026/https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/81891/Read"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson knew every song on Shaggy&#39;s Hot Shot album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Jamaican-American rapper found worldwide fame in 2000 when he released It Wasn&#39;t Me, featuring Rikrok, from his multi-platinum selling fifth studio album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While the song topped the charts all over the world, Shaggy was surprised to learn late King of Pop Michael was also a huge fan of the track. In fact, the Billy Jean singer liked it so much he requested Shaggy play it live at his 2001 30th Anniversary concert in Madison Square Garden.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He told me that the story in the song sounded like something that would happen to him - so who knows, man? I just thought he was really clever and brilliant, and he knew every record on that album Hot Shot, which was very nice. And he just wanted to know everything about me,&quot; Shaggy smiled to British newspaper Metro.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We maintained a kind of friendship; he was just a person that reached out to me.
