How to make sense of Michael Jackson, a man whose immeasurable talent is often overshadowed by tabloid headlines? The former Jackson 5 lead vocalist rocketed to solo fame with his 1982 album, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (the video of the same name has been declared the greatest ever by TV Guide and MTV). Then, in 1993, claims of molestation brought against him by a 13-year-old boy &mdash; charges that were settled out of court for an undisclosed sum and which the singer has vehemently denied &mdash; heavily tarnished his platinum image. Still, Jackson presses on. Seated in a New York City hotel suite, the notoriously shy pop star is charismatic and bubbly &mdash; a </span><span class="cs43C038A">regular</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> guy, even &mdash; as he discusses future projects, including an as-yet-untitled CD he describes as &quot;happy, dance music, relationship stuff,&quot; and a reunion album with his brothers. And then there is &quot;The Nightmare of Edgar Allan Poe,&quot; in which he will star as the 19th-century writer. Scheduled to shoot next year, Jackson says he&#39;s doing the film because Poe&#39;s life &quot;is very interesting,&quot; adding, without irony, &quot;I love an artist who doesn&#39;t play it safe.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> changed music videos forever. Where did you get the idea?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">My brother Jackie came to my house and said, &quot;Are you watching this show that&#39;s on TV? All they do is play music. It&#39;s MTV.&quot; I put it on and thought the concept was very interesting. What I didn&#39;t like were the videos that were a collage of images; I thought that if I were to do one, I would do something with a little more entertainment value. My dream was to make something with a beginning, a middle and an ending, like a short film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you ever imagine that </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and the videos from the album would catapult your career into the stratosphere?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I didn&#39;t really think about how the album would do; I just wanted to create what I would enjoy seeing. And my main goal for [the video] &quot;Thriller&quot; was to do something that would be scary, fun and exciting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How do you look back on that whole era now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I see it as a happy time and sad time. And an exciting time. Because it made a lot of my dreams come true. The notoriety was wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You also said it was a sad time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah. If I don&#39;t get exactly what I&#39;m looking for, I get very depressed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You mean the album still didn&#39;t live up to what you had envisioned?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Not completely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Which songs disappointed you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Wanna Be Startin&#39; Somethin&#39;.&quot; Songwriting is a very frustrating art form. You have to get on tape exactly what&#39;s playing in your head. When I hear it up here [</span><span class="cs43C038A">points to his head</span><span class="csD5D7D290">], it&#39;s wonderful. I have to transcribe that onto tape. &quot;The Girl is Mine&quot; [</span><span class="cs43C038A">his duet with Paul McCartney</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] wasn&#39;t completely what I wanted, but it&#39;s very nice. But &quot;Billie Jean&quot; is there. I worked so hard on that. I worked for three weeks on the bass lick alone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">The glove, the white socks, the red leather jacket &mdash; who came up with those things?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">The glove was just &mdash; I thought one was cooler than two. I love to accent movement. The eye goes to where the white is &mdash; you know, the glove. And the feet, if you&#39;re dancing, you can put an exclamation point on your movement if it has a bit of light on it. So I wore the white socks. And for the design of the jacket, I would sit with the people who made the clothes and tell them where I wanted a button or a buckle or a design.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But I don&#39;t wear that look anymore. It&#39;s sad to get caught up in the past. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t put awards in my house. No gold records, no Grammys. They&#39;re in storage. I don&#39;t like to be puffed up with pride, &#39;cause I&#39;d feel like I don&#39;t have any more things to reach for. And that&#39;s not true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Do you feel like your most creative period is yet to come?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I think the best work is coming, but I&#39;d like to go into other areas, not keep doing album after pop album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are there artists that are doing interesting things musically?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">There&#39;s some wonderful creative ideas, but I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s being innovative. They&#39;re mostly grabbing the old and trying to integrate it with the new.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Is there anyone you&#39;d like to work with?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">There are a lot of artists I admire, but no.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">What is your favorite music?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You&#39;d be shocked. This morning I was singing Rodgers and Hammerstein. That&#39;s the stuff I sing around the house &mdash; &ldquo;My Favorite Things&rdquo; from </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Sound of Music</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, and &ldquo;Absent Minded Me,&rdquo; that Streisand song. I&#39;m also a fan of the great old MGM musicals. I love show tunes. I&#39;m a big fan of melody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&#39;s your favorite song to perform?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Billie Jean,&rdquo; but only when I don&#39;t have to do it the same way. The audience wants a certain thing. I have to do the moonwalk in </span><span class="cs43C038A">that</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> spot. [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] I&#39;d like to do a different version.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who&#39;s your audience today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t know. I just try to write wonderful music; and if they love it, they love it. I don&#39;t think about any demographic. [The record company] tries to get me to think that way, but I just do what I would enjoy hearing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is there a new Michael for the new millennium?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I have a couple of things planned. I think it&#39;s going to be totally different than what I did before. There&#39;s a song on the new album called &ldquo;I Have This Dream.&rdquo; It&#39;s a millennium song about the world and the environment that I co-wrote with Carole Bayer Sager and David Foster.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you think you will tour again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t think so. It takes a lot out of me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You rarely travel in public without a disguise. Why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t see any other way. I&#39;ve tried everything. [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] Fat suits. Nuns. Clowns. Trick or treat is the best for me. And Mardi Gras.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you think you&#39;ll ever be able to walk around freely just as yourself?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I do disguises for different reasons. I like to study people &mdash; be like the fly on the wall. Even if it&#39;s two old ladies sitting on a bench or some kids on a swing. Because I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to fit in an everyday life situation. One time I was in a record store, completely disguised, and these girls were pulling out my album, talking all about me. I was literally next to them. It was wonderful. I loved it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But if I go out as myself, I can&#39;t have fun. People always say, &ldquo;Why don&#39;t we just go to a party?&rdquo; Soon as I step in, the party&#39;s over &mdash; </span><span class="cs43C038A">for me</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. It&#39;s a party for </span><span class="cs43C038A">them</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, but they&#39;re all putting their cards in my face, saying, &ldquo;Remember me? I met you four years ago at....&rdquo; And I say, &ldquo;I don&#39;t remember.&rdquo; So I can&#39;t enjoy the experience. They play all my songs. I didn&#39;t come to hear my music. And everybody starts chanting, &quot;Dance!&quot; &quot;Well, I want to see </span><span class="cs43C038A">you</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> dance for a change.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you think, given all the negative press that you&#39;ve had, that people will judge you solely on your music?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t think so. &#39;Cause [the press] has made me out to be this monster, this crazy person who&#39;s bizarre and weird. I&#39;m nothing like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is there anything you can do to change that impression?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, all I can do is be myself and create from my soul. But they take that and manipulate it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> But what will make you seem OK to people who think, &ldquo;He&#39;s weird; he has exotic animals in his house,&rdquo; or&mdash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">God created animals. And they&#39;re loving; they&#39;re beautiful. I feel the way [anthropologist] Jane Goodall does, or any of those naturalists. I don&#39;t find my interest in animals weird or strange at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What about the plastic surgery?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">All of Hollywood has plastic surgery! I don&#39;t know why they point me out. The press exaggerated it. It&#39;s just to my nose, you know. They want it to be everything. Just the nose isn&#39;t enough. Elvis had his nose done &mdash; Lisa Marie [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Presley, to whom Jackson was married from May 1994 to January 1996</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] told me. They don&#39;t talk about that. They single me out. It&#39;s not fair.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> OK, well, now that you bring up Lisa Marie, I read that you said she regrets not having had your son and that she may still want to have a child with you. Is that true?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, I remember that&#39;s how she felt at the time. [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">] No matter what I say, I&#39;m in trouble with this question &mdash; the next issue [of TV Guide] will probably say, &ldquo;Well, Lisa said she doesn&#39;t ever want to see him again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are you two friends now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Lisa&#39;s sweet. I like her very much, and we are friends. And who knows what tomorrow brings? I have no idea how she feels today. I&#39;ll just say that. She comes to my house and sees the children [</span><span class="cs43C038A">from Jackson&#39;s second marriage, to Debbie Rowe, whom he wed in November 1996 and who filed for divorce in October 1999</span><span class="csD5D7D290">], and we talk on the phone, that sort of thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you think you&#39;ll marry again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That would be nice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What would make the third time the charm?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">It just has to hit me. You have to see that person and go, &ldquo;This is it. This is the one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you feel that way with both marriages?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, of course.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you wish you were still married?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I do. But you have to do what&#39;s best. What happens happens. You have to respect that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who are your closest friends?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Elizabeth [Taylor], for sure. We go to the movies every Thursday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You go to a regular movie theater?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I want to go to the Warner Bros. studio, and she refuses. She says, &ldquo;No, I&#39;m getting you out.&rdquo; So we go right into this area &mdash; which I can&#39;t say &mdash; and walk right in. And it&#39;s usually empty, because [most] people are working at the time. [The theater employees] go, &ldquo;Wow, come in,&rdquo; and we never really pay. And we&#39;re the ones that can afford it. [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Laughs</span><span class="csD5D7D290">]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Let&#39;s talk about your kids [</span><span class="cs43C038A">Prince Michael, 2, and Paris Katherine, 1</span><span class="csD5D7D290">]. I have to ask about this business in the papers recently about you and Debbie not being the biological parents of your children, about her being implanted with another woman&#39;s egg and then impregnated by artificial insemination.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s total garbage. It&#39;s just trash and not true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do the kids live with you at Neverland?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">They were at Neverland two weeks ago. I think they realized for the first time that it&#39;s their home. They used to always think it was some hotel resort. We stay in hotels everywhere. They didn&#39;t realize that the train and the train station is for them, and those rides are for them. Now they go, &ldquo;We want to go to Neverland!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What are their personalities like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Prince tells me all day that he has to make movies. So I bought him this video camera. I say, &ldquo;What are we doing this time?&rdquo; He goes, &ldquo;Star Wars.&rdquo; So we put some figures on the table, make them move. And Paris is just now starting to talk and walk. She&#39;s very sweet. And I&#39;m surprised she loves dolls. My sister Janet didn&#39;t like that sort of thing. She was a tomboy. I thought [Paris] was going to be like that, but she isn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And you&#39;re changing their diapers and feeding them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I love it. It&#39;s a lot of work. I thought I was prepared &#39;cause I read everything about child rearing, but it&#39;s so much more exciting than I ever imagined it would be. The only regret I have is that I wish I had done it earlier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do you sing and dance for them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s how I keep them quiet if they&#39;re crying.

I told my father [Joe] I&#39;m going to match his record. He had 10.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What is your relationship with your father like now? You were estranged from him for a while.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I have the best relationship now that I&#39;ve ever had with him. I think with age and time he&#39;s really mellowed out to become a nice person. He&#39;ll simply say to me, &ldquo;How are you doing? That&#39;s all I wanted to know.&rdquo; Not, &ldquo;Did you sign that contract?&rdquo; He just wants to know if I&#39;m OK. I think that&#39;s really nice.... And my mother [Katherine] is like the perfect angel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> At 41, are you happy?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, I usually am happy. I don&#39;t let anything get me down, no matter what. I like to hear the sound of water and birds chirping and laughter, you know. I love all the real, natural, innocent things. I would never go to a party or a club. I did that when I was a kid, and I don&#39;t care to do that anymore.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I found it jarring to read a recent quote in which you said that if it weren&#39;t for your desire to help the children of the world, you&#39;d throw in the towel and kill yourself. Do you really feel that way?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I always have. &#39;Cause I would feel I have nothing to live for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">TV Guide:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Not even for yourself and your own creativity?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I wouldn&#39;t care. Everything I create is inspired by that kind of innocence. And nature, it&#39;s everything. It has to be. I mean, that&#39;s it.</span></p></body>
