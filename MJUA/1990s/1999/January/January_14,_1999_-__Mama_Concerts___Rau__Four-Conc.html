Jackson&#39;s Aloha Stadium stage will be in place by the time the performer arrives in Hawaii, which will be &quot;early&quot; Dec. 31, Avram said. Sydney is 20 hours ahead of Hawaii.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Sydney and Honolulu concerts will be Jackson&#39;s only for-profit shows of the year, Avram said. He will perform in charity concerts in June in Munich, Germany, and Seoul.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The official announcement of the Hawaii concert will be made after several important details of the show have been completed, Avram said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There are a great many things to coordinate,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not the usual concert like the last time Michael performed in Hawaii (in January 1997). A millennium show is a huge enterprise and until we have everything decided from the technical point of view and the other acts, we don&#39;t want to make any incomplete announcements.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Avram, 61, was the promoter for Jackson&#39;s two 1997 Hawaii performances, which both sold out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Promoter Marek Lieberberg, Avram&#39;s former partner, last week signed a contract and made a deposit with Aloha Stadium on behalf of Avram for use of the venue New Year&#39;s Eve, said Lieberberg, who in February promoted the Celine Dion concert at the stadium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Plans being considered for the concert include surrounding the stadium&#39;s exterior with several large tents, where special entertainment will be presented and some of Hawaii&#39;s premier chefs will serve food.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though the top ticket may be the highest-priced ever for a concert in Hawaii, Avram said other ticket prices will fit regular budgets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/40057/jackson-sued-over-nixed-y2k-shows"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;E! News&rdquo; (June 26, 2000)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190604214237/https://www.eonline.com/news/40057/jackson-sued-over-nixed-y2k-shows"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s another legal thriller involving the King of Pop and his longtime concert promoter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Marcel Avram, Michael Jackson&#39;s Munich-based promoter for nearly three decades, slapped Jackson with a $21.2 million lawsuit last week, alleging the Gloved One pulled out of two millennium concerts that cost Avram millions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Avram&#39;s lawyers filed the suit Friday in Santa Barbara, California, Superior Court, according to a statement issued by Avram&#39;s company, Mama Concerts &amp; Rau, from its Munich headquarters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The statement claims Jackson had, on January 14, 1999, signed a four-concert deal that included two New Year&#39;s Eve concerts straddling the international date line: one in Sydney and, a speed jet ride later, one in Honolulu.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The suit, which claims damages for breach of contract and fraud, acknowledges Jackson did perform two charity concerts in Seoul and Munich as stipulated by the contract, but that &quot;ticket sales were dismal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to the suit, Jackson didn&#39;t tell Avram until October 1999 that he wouldn&#39;t be playing the Y2K Eve concerts in Sydney or Honolulu.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Jackson dropped out, Avram said, he &quot;was left to explain Michael Jackson&#39;s erratic behavior--and to pay all of his bills.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The suit says Avram, who paid Jackson $1 million upfront, tried to settle with the megastar amicably for six months--even though the singer&#39;s contract allegedly had no escape clause.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There is nothing else we can do but to remind Michael Jackson of his responsibilities as an artist and businessman. Saying &#39;I love you&#39; is not enough,&quot; Avram, who has been Jackson&#39;s concert promoter since 1972, tells Reuters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Avram wants $10 million for out-of-pocket losses (including advanced costs associated with promoting and producing the four concerts); $1.2 million to pay for old debts incurred by Jackson; about $10 million in lost profits from the millennium concerts; and yet-to-be-determined costs arising from damage to Avram&#39;s professional reputation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not that Avram had that great a rep to begin with. The last time he made headlines was in 1997, when he was jailed for three and a half years in Germany on 12 counts of tax evasion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And this isn&#39;t the first time Avram and Jacko squared off in court. In 1993, Avram sued Jackson for $20 million for canceling his &quot;Dangerous&quot; world tour--that complaint was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s company, MJJ Enterprises Inc., had no comment on the latest suit.</span></p></body>
