In addition, CJ Devillar, who also had a hand in setting up the meeting, left Michael&rsquo;s project &ldquo;in early 1999&rdquo; (all quotes from Mike Smallcombe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brandy Norwood, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/-pNQ7WR5xrU"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;When I Was 17&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1659776/brandy-when-i-was-17/"><span class="cs8567212B">MTV News summary</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sometimes celebrities get starstruck too &mdash; just ask Brandy. In the latest episode of &quot;When I Was 17,&quot; the singer-turned-reality starlet opens up about meeting Michael Jackson, thanks to producer Rodney Jerkins.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I was 17, my producer Rodney Jerkins was working with Michael Jackson at the time,&quot; Brandy says in the episode, premiering Saturday at 11 a.m. ET on MTV. &quot;He knew how much I wanted to meet Michael Jackson, so he says, &#39;Would you like to come and meet him?&#39; I&#39;m like, &#39;Are you serious? Of course I want to meet Michael Jackson! Where do I meet you? Where do we come?&#39; &quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And it wasn&#39;t just Jerkins who knew about the singer&#39;s admiration for Jackson. &quot;Michael Jackson was it, so we studied Michael. Brandy studied Michael,&quot; her brother Ray J says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brandy says the super-producer orchestrated the meeting between the siblings and Jackson at the recording studio. However, prior to entering the room, Brandy says nerves got the best of her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;My heart is beating so fast at this point,&quot; the &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; alum recalls. &quot;I&#39;m like, &#39;Oh my God. It&#39;s happening. We&#39;re about to open the door and he&#39;s going to be in there.&#39; &quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ray J, who was equally excited, peeped around the room, saying, &quot;When we first walked into the studio, we can kind of see Michael in the corner and we looked at each other like, &#39;Did you see him?&#39; &quot; Unfortunately, Brandy, couldn&#39;t maintain the same type as composure. &quot;And I&#39;m looking at him like, &#39;Oh my God. This is Michael Jackson,&#39; &quot; adding, &quot;I fainted, blacked out &mdash; like seriously blacked out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">CJ DeVillar, bassist and mix engineer,<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-054-cj-devillar-special/"><span> </span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-054-cj-devillar-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast Episode 54 (April 12, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Devillar:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> One little story I have with Brandy [Norwood], I had recorded Brandy some months before... I had ran into her at the front desk at the Record Plant, and she knew Michael was there, she knew I was recording Michael, and she had never met Michael. And she walked up to me like a fan, wide-eyed. &quot;Oh my God, you gotta introduce me to Michael! Can you introduce me to Michael, please?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh my gosh.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;First of all, it&#39;s her, and I want to keep working with her&quot;, so I&#39;m like--anybody else, I&#39;d say no, &#39;cause I&#39;m also there catching stuff for Michael for him not to get bugged. It&#39;s kind of what I do also, right? But now I&#39;m like trapped. I&#39;m like, &quot;Ok, it&#39;s Brandy, and maybe Michael would want to know.&quot; I justified it like that. So I was like--I rarely knock on his lounge door, so I knocked on his lounge door, and he opened it up. And I said, &quot;Michael, Brandy&#39;s out here, wants to meet you, she just desperately wants to meet you. She won&#39;t leave me alone&quot;. And he&#39;s going, &quot;Oh. Oh my gosh, but I&#39;m so stinky&quot;. And he meant that in the real way, because when he gets in the studio, he&#39;s like us. I can tell that he&#39;s just rolling out of bed, putting on the t-shirt he had on the chair, throwing on some shoes with no socks going to the studio. He did that sometimes. So he had on--I mean, Michael, you know, he may... sometimes--he needed a shower sometimes, guys. Ok?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[The MJCast crew laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">And so--and he was like, &quot;Oh my gosh&quot;--and he knew it too, so he was like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m not--&quot;, he was like he wasn&#39;t together, you know. But he said, &quot;Ok&quot; anyway. And so he had this wrinkled-up old t-shirt on, he&#39;d probably been wearing it for three or four days, and no socks, penny loafers, and some regular old pants that he&#39;d probably been wearing. &#39;Cause he was in--kind of in work mode. You know, get up, go to the studio, go home, sleep, get up, you know. You know how we do that. We&#39;re just like, you know? And so I showed her to his door, and he invited her in, and they chatted for a couple hours. But he was so sweet, you know? He was like--he didn&#39;t care, guys. You know what I&#39;m saying? So he wasn&#39;t that much of a perfectionist for his own--I don&#39;t have the right word for it, but he was more sacrificial in his time with people than he was compared for himself. Like he could&#39;ve said, &quot;No, I&#39;m not ready&quot; or &quot;I need to take a bath in the sink&quot; or whatever he needs to do... So I always thought that was a little thing that I liked about him, that he accommodated anybody that wanted to talk to him...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Out of that meeting, they did little bits of work together. He did some amazing background vocals on one of her tracks called &quot;It&#39;s Not Worth It&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Oh, that&#39;s sweet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So, nice job, thanks!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, she was a sweet person too. I really liked her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Some great stuff in her catalog too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Oh, yeah. She was great.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I think she did backing vocals on one of Michael&#39;s song, didn&#39;t she? On Invincible?... I think she&#39;s on &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, I think.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Really? Oh, that&#39;s good to know. Oh, fantastic. I&#39;d like to think I had a little something to do with that...</span></p></body>
