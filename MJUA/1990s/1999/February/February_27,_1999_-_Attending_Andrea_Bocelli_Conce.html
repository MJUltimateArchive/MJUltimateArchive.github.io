We stayed at the incredibly beautiful Bellagio, where we had dinner and watched the fountains. The whole thing was just perfect for me because I&rsquo;ve grown tired of big-deal birthdays. At one point, I turned to Michael and said, &lsquo;All right, where&rsquo;s my present?&rsquo; Well he looked at the ground, he looked around the room, he looked at our friend Arnie Klein, but he didn&rsquo;t really say anything. So I said, &lsquo;Michael, I know they have great jewelry shops in the lobby. I can&rsquo;t believe you haven&rsquo;t noticed.&rsquo; Michael and Arnie start giggling. I continued, &lsquo;This is really breaking my heart, Michael. I&rsquo;m not sure I can go on.&rsquo; You know, I was really hamming it up. Finally, Michael and Arnie excused themselves and returned to the table some time later with a perfectly interesting-sized book. &nbsp;Any box can be interesting to me! I opened it and inside was some weird padded black wrapping, protecting the most exquisite titanium elephant evening bag. A saddle of rubies and pearls was dangling from its backside, and the dear little creature had huge diamond eyes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Michael! Michael! I was just kidding around!&rsquo; I mean, this was the most unusual thing I&rsquo;d ever seen. I was playing with the long dangling pearls, in part because I was so happy and because I was a little embarrassed that he had actually gone and gotten me something this amazing. But Michael and I do kid around a lot, and I knew I hadn&rsquo;t really overstepped my place in our relationship.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I got home, there in my front hall was a huge box, tied with a red ribbon. It was my real birthday present from Michael, the one had planned to give me all along &ndash; one of those superflat TV sets. Truly, the biggest one I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I was an innocent in all of this, the most happy innocent. And Michael played it totally straight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Arnold Klein, cosmetic dermatologist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-jackson-liz-drug-link"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Daily Beast&rdquo; (July 6, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190819191335/https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-jackson-liz-drug-link"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) </span></p><p class="cs17B2069"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Klein not only counted Taylor and Jackson as patients but socialized with both. When Liz celebrated her birthday, for instance in 1999 at Las Vegas&rsquo; Bellagio Hotel, at an Andrea Bocelli concert, she only invited Michael, Klein, her hairdresser, and her then-boyfriend, a Beverly Hills dentist and his two sons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
