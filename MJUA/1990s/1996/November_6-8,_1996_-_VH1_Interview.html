		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">VH1 Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that it takes place in &ldquo;Thailand 1996&rdquo; (confirmed on <a class="cs8048ECCE" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1615349/michael-jackson-answers-fan-questions-in-1996-thailand-interview/"><span class="cs149B5A36">MTV News</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A"> and <a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://youtu.be/etKnckns-oQ"><span class="cs149B5A36">on video</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">) and it could not have been the day he arrived on November 5, 1996, because, due to rain and &ldquo;feeling a little under the weather&hellip; the day of the show (November 5), Michael stayed in his hotel&rdquo; (<a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://youtu.be/Wl_hXLazJoA?t=7m20s"><span class="cs149B5A36">Inside Edition</span></a></span><span class="cs43C038A">). November 8th was the last possible day since he had a show November 9th in Auckland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;VH1&rdquo; interview transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Every interview I&#39;ve ever done I&#39;ve been forced into. And you guys (VH1) have been so nice to me and that&#39;s the only reason I agreed to do this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: What are some of the things that make you angry?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I believe in perfection, and I try to create that in everything I do. We never seem to totally get there, but I believe in perfect execution. And when we don&#39;t get at least 99.9%, I get really upset, so that gets me upset.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Are you going to be doing any more videos off your HIStory album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: There&#39;s a lot more releases from HIStory. We have the Ghosts (short film) coming up, which is a big one, and Stranger in Moscow, and it&#39;s just gonna go on and on. I mean, we&#39;re at 28 million albums right now, other than what the press continue to lie about - they&#39;re terrible. Don&#39;t read the tabloids - that&#39;s something you (the fans) can play. Don&#39;t read stories that aren&#39;t true. They write those stories to mislead you and you&#39;re making them rich. It&#39;s not true, don&#39;t read it, it&#39;s garbage, it&#39;s junk food. Believe what I tell you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Why are you wearing a silk mask in your latest appearances?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Because with time my skin condition has gotten worse. I hate to say it. I have vitiligo, and I&#39;m totally completely allergic to the sun. I&#39;m not even supposed to be outside actually. Even if I&#39;m in the shade the sun rays can destroy my skin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Are there any songs you released that you wished you didn&#39;t?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Not that I can think of. Some of the Motown songs, the early ones, I remember getting upset with the songwriters &#39;cause I wanted to sing them one way and they wanted me to sing it another way. And I would call Berry Gordy, who is the chairman/owner of the company. He would say, &quot;Look, let Michael do what he wants, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Was the atmosphere between Motown stars competitive or friendly?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Very friendly. Marvin Gaye used to come to my house at least twice a week to play basketball with my brothers. Stevie Wonder would come by for gatherings and parties, and I would go to the Supreme&#39;s house and Diana Ross would invite the girls over and it was really sincerely one happy family. We would have a baseball team where we played against one another, and I was just really little but they let me bat, and it was really a happy family and I do miss all of them - even the Temptations, they would come over to my house all the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Are you going to retape the HBO special you cancelled last year, and if so, when?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yes, we&#39;re planning on doing that in South Africa.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Have you ever been scared to go on stage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: No. I don&#39;t remember ever being afraid to go on stage. I&#39;m more comfortable on stage than giving this interview right now!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Are you going to do any concerts here in the United States?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I&#39;d like to - we&#39;re planning on next year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Do you ever plan on working with Quincy Jones again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I would love to work with Quincy again. The doors are always open. We&#39;re very friendly with eachother. But I just like challenging and doing different things and experimenting. He&#39;s a very endearing person and I do love him very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: If you could spend one day in complete anonymity, where would you go and what would you do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Probably go to Neverland, or an isolated island somewhere. What would I do? Probably write music or kind of create some music or stage play or something - something creative. I never stop working.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Does the real Billie Jean know about the song and if she did what was her reaction?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: There is a girl named Billie Jean, but it&#39;s not about that Billie Jean. Billie Jean is kinda anonymous. It represents a lot of girls who used to - they used to call them groupies in the &#39;60s - they would hang around backstage doors and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with. And I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to my brothers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: Which songs of yours are autobiographical?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Stranger in Moscow, Heal the World, We Are The World, I&#39;ll Be There. Those type of songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Question: What inspired the song Stranger in Moscow?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I wrote that in Moscow. The lyrics are totally autobiographical. When you hear lines like, &quot;Here abandoned in my fame...Armageddon of the brain&quot; - at the time, on the last tour when we were in Moscow - that&#39;s how I really felt. It kinda created itself. It fell into my lap, because that&#39;s how I was feeling at the time. Just alone in my hotel and it was raining and I just started writing it.</span></p></body>
