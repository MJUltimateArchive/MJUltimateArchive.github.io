Fits with the interviewer saying &ldquo;It is GOING to be your 5th visit in Japan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Japanese fans... longing for your ARRIVAL&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson &ldquo;NTV&rdquo; interview</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV (Nippon TV): </span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How did you feel about the Philippines&rsquo; enthusiastic welcome?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: Oh, well I&lsquo;ve been in the business all my life and you would think I would be used to it, but there&rsquo;s just that euphoric kind of rush, of love, you could feel their love, and you feel it more in different countries than others, and here (Japan) was just on a high level, which is great.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Um, it was a great expression. I mean the love like I said before, it&rsquo;s amazing, from the fans all over the world. I don&rsquo;t think I could ever get used to that, I really appreciate it and I love LOVE! It&rsquo;s a great feeling, it really is. It&rsquo;s like a high, it&rsquo;s a natural high.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV: </span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;s been 3 months since the HIStory tour started. And we hear that you are touring many new countries. Of those new countries, which left you the biggest impression, and why is that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, we put our hearts into performing, and every night I give my all on the stage. I don&rsquo;t put one country over another, I mean everywhere is as important as the next place. Some shows I just don&rsquo;t feel like going out because maybe my back hurts, or I haven&rsquo;t slept the night before, but as soon as the lights hit you and you hear the roaring of a hundred thousand people, it&rsquo;s magic, totally magic, and I never get used to that, and I&rsquo;ve done it all my life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV: </span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Before the tour, you made the short film Ghosts. What made you want to make it? And how did your fans react?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, the reaction has been wonderful, I mean it&rsquo;s been exceptional, like overwhelming in Australia, where we premiered it. It first premiered in Los Angeles, but I didn&rsquo;t get to go to that one, so I went to Australia and they loved it so much, I could hardly hear what was going on on the screen. It was really exciting, and it&rsquo;s a great feeling because we worked very hard on it. It&rsquo;s a short film with state of the art effects, and high level entertainment, and it&rsquo;s just fun. It&rsquo;s really fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be your 5th visit in Japan. Is there anything you are especially looking forward to doing during your stay?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I think the loyalty of the fans and the love there is very high too. I love the Japanese people, they&rsquo;ve been great for thirty years. Very loyal and loving.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Your first (solo) tour in Japan was the Bad tour in 1987. Do you find any changes in Japan?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> In Japan? I always notice the technology. I&rsquo;m always amazed by what you&#39;re coming up with next. It&rsquo;s like there is a digital craze going on now &ndash; make it smaller and it becomes bigger, and clearer. And the children, I think, are so sweet, the little round faces of the babies. I love them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV: </span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When we listen to your music, your consistent messages are love and peace. But these days, the world situation doesn&rsquo;t match your messages. What are the things you are concerned about the situation nowadays?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I try to be very positive in my songs when I write them, and look at the bright side of things, and I&rsquo;m not totally happy with the situation in the world right now (looks right at the camera), but I always try to write songs with a positive message in it to convey hope for people, to make things better, and not look at the downside all the time, or promote something negative or bad. Even though I did an album called &ldquo;BAD&rdquo;, but I meant &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in a good way (laughs).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV: </span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We hear you are welcoming a baby soon. With your new adventure, are there any things that you feel differently about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I think it&rsquo;ll be the most joyous occasion in my life, I think, and I hope it&rsquo;s everything that people talk about, because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always wanted. I would like to have 12 kids or more, I love kids, babies, and I think that&rsquo;s what keeps me holding on and having faith in the world. That&rsquo;s our only hope I think, that&rsquo;s what inspires me the most.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Do you think your music will be different / changed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I would like it to, that would be great I mean, for the better.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV: </span><span class="csD5D7D290"> At last, could you give some messages to the Japanese fans who have been longing for your arrival?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I look forward to the concert and I look forward to feeling that great rush of love. I just want the Japanese people to know that I love you very much, and I can&rsquo;t wait to see you. (Smiles)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NTV:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Thank you, thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At 6:22 of this interview, an alarm keeps going off on someone&rsquo;s watch and Michael finds it extremely funny, and is unable to suppress his laughter.</span></p></body>
