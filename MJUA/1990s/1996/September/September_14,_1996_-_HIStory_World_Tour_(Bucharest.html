		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">HIStory World Tour (Bucharest, Romania)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Winters, actor in &ldquo;Westside Story&rdquo; film (&ldquo;A-Rab&rdquo; character), &ldquo;Magick Papers &amp; Nightlife Thailand&rdquo; blog (June 26, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101125172803/http://www.magickpapers.com/blog/?p=400"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During this time I was putting a deal together to film a Pilot for a TV series &ldquo;Star School&rdquo; in Bucharest, Romania, and also I was trying to sell the tv stations there some of the films from my 100 film library, so I invited Irina (girlfriend) to accompany me there. Michael Badica, my partner in Romania had sold 3 films and they were released theatrically, but I never got any money from the distributor, so Irina and I went to check it out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not long after we arrived in Bucharest, Romania I met a guy who owned a tv station and was the promoter of The Michael Jackson Tour. We got talking and I told him that I had worked with Michael previously (see <a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://mjultimatearchive.github.io/MJUA/1980s/1981/March_2,_1981.html"><span class="cs8567212B">here</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">). He mentioned me to Michael and then came back and told me that Michael wanted to see me right away and was inviting myself and Irina to accompany him to the show and he gave me some extra special V.I.P. passes and told me that we could sit right in the middle of the stadium next to the sound and lights in Michael&rsquo;s special V.I.P. section.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The stadium held over 100,000 people and that night we went with Michael in a limousine. Actually it was part of a huge convoy of limousines that was guarded by hundreds of army soldiers. He was very excited about all the pomp and circumstance surrounding his appearances there. When we arrived there were literally hundreds more military personnel watching over us. We were first served food and drinks and then when it was time for Michael&rsquo;s entrance, he said goodbye to me, and I and Irina were led out the the middle of the stadium to an area that was also very protected by many soldiers with all their gear on. Almost kind of a cross between a soldier and a riot policeman. We were like in a little oasis in this huge stadium and there was a ring of these special forces of police and army men surrounding us the whole time. It was kind of surreal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was an incredible stage show, and Irina was in hog heaven as she watched Michael perform, having just been with him in the limousine. He WAS amazing and he definitely is one of the all time great live performers I have ever seen. In all we saw about 4 or 5 of his shows that week. Everyone sold out, and everyone better than the last. Michael worked soo hard to please his fans. He gave it his all. And boy, did they ever LOVE Michael. The only time I have ever seen this kind of adulation before was when I did 4 films with Elvis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the show one of Michael&rsquo;s people came up to me and told me that Michael wanted to talk to me in his hotel suite alone. Poor Irina, she had wanted to see Michael again just to tell him how much she loved his show. As it turned out, I also wanted to talk to Michael about a musical film project that I had called &ldquo;Nicholas Jingle&rdquo;. It is the story of how Santa Clause came to be. I wanted Michael to play Oliver J. Twinkleberry, an elf and the spirit of Christmas in the film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So with Irina and Michael Badica waiting in the coffee shop of the hotel I was taken up to Michael&rsquo;s suite.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was being led into Michael&rsquo;s presidential suite when a little boy walks past me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then as we turn into the living room there is a little girl playing in the corner. Before I know it I&rsquo;m introduced to the mother of the children, who is on the couch in the living room. She is well off, that&rsquo;s for sure and then I meet her husband. I had seen him filming the show on video several times. They had come to say goodbye to Michael as they were leaving in the morning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just then Michael came out and said &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we sit in the dining room&rdquo;. I told him what a fabulous show he put on and we exchanged pleasantries. I told him that I was now very friendly with his dad Joe, and that his mother Katherine, who was really sweet, had cooked me dinner one night at his house in the valley in L.A.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He then started with his questions regarding, you know it, &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo;. As he&rsquo;s asking me one of the questions he puts these crazy glasses on that that have slinkys for eyes. You know the kind that you laugh at when you see them. Big eyes, and these silly round metal things falling from each eye. Michael looked soo silly but his questions were very serious. We sat there for about 45 minutes talking, and oblivious of anyone else in the room. The promoter was also in the room with us but Michael never said a word to him, and didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge him. It was terrific. It was the first time I had had such a long conversation with him, and I realized how well he knew &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo;. I also talked about my film and he said he was very very interested in it. He told me to get him the script and he&rsquo;d get back to me very quickly. My heart was beating very fast at the prospect of having Michael in the film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We said goodnight to each other and I left feeling very happy personally and very satisfied professionally about our time together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My friend the promoter went down in the elevator with me and was stunned. He told me that as long as he knew Michael he had never seen him talk to someone for so long and be so animated. In fact he said that Michael rarely talked to anyone. I felt truly honored as Michael had invited me to come see him again the next day. As Irina and I retired to our hotel all I could think about was what a lovely sweet human being Michael was, as well as one of the greatest entertainers in the world!</span></p></body>
