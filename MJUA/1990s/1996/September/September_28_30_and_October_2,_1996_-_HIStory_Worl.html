The voiceover counts down. And Michael Jackson blasts onto the Amsterdam stage in a spectacular space capsule. Over 50,000 fans bought tickets in three hours to see their idol. Tomorrow and the next night are also completely sold out. Yes pop peep, Michael Jackson, standing motionless in a silver surfer spacesuit, is back on planet pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Our Ric meets with Michael!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, our Consultant Ed, Ric, was backstage at the venue hob-knobbing with Michael. Ric called us up from Amsterdam to tell us what he was like!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was brilliant! When I heard the record company were arranging</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was brilliant! When I heard the record company were arranging for me to meet Michael, I decided to take him a couple of gifts--a video of all the times he&#39;d appeared on TOTP with The Jacksons and The Jackson 5, and an Arsenal football shirt that had the word &#39;Jackson&#39; printed on the back! He was delighted with his gifts and said he might wear the football shirt in a future video!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael thanked TOTP for all the help we&#39;ve given 3T and said he&#39;d seen the video of our TOTP Weekend and thought it was brilliant. I asked him about the possibility of him performing on TOTP in the near future and he replied that he&#39;d love to! I can honestly say that Michael was an extremely nice guy, who seemed fully clued-up on what was happening in music. He looked in great shape, had a very firm handshake, and the only odd thing about him were his socks, one was white and one was blue! It was a fantastic moment meeting the king of pop. Afterwards, his manager said it was the longest meeting anyone had had in years with Michael, outside of his family. Brilliant!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Winters, actor in &ldquo;Westside Story&rdquo; film (&ldquo;A-Rab&rdquo; character), <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.magickpapers.com/blog/?p=400"><span class="cs8567212B">Magick Papers &amp; Nightlife Thailand</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702033511/http://www.magickpapers.com/blog/?p=400"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So later that afternoon Skye (friend) and I went to the Hotel where hundreds of screaming kids were being held back by the police and waiting for Michael. They screamed even louder when I pulled in with my cream coloured Rolls Royce and it&rsquo;s California license plate &ldquo;Muvies&rdquo; They all tried to look in the back, thinking that I was smuggling Michael into the hotel. Security let us through and we picked up all of our tickets, and just as we were about to go Michael comes in the front door of the Hotel lobby. There&rsquo;s madness outside. Lights flashing everywhere, fans screaming even louder than before and all the handlers trying to rush Michael through the lobby to to his suite. Michael sees me and stops. &rdquo;Hi David&rdquo; he says in that hushed tone, i&rsquo;m now used to. He was barely audible above the din of the fans. &ldquo;Hi Michael&rdquo;, I said in return, &ldquo;this is my friend Skye&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from the hospital, where I saw a lot of sick kids&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &ldquo;You must be exhausted, go rest and we&rsquo;ll see you backstage or here tomorrow&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He nodded in appreciation and was swooped up and almost carried to the elevator by his entourage. I turned and watched him disappear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I thought, what a giving person. He just arrived in town and even before he checks into the hotel he goes right away to the hospital to visit the seriously sick children in the cancer ward. He seriously LOVED children. And I loved the child in Michael!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In fact I accompanied him on one of these trips. He would go tirelessly from hospital to hospital meeting these children just to brighten up their lives. When he finished the visit he would ask the hospital nurses and doctors what was needed at the hospital in terms of equipment for the kids. Once told, he would then make an anonymous donation to the hospital.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I also know for a fact that he has given tens of millions of dollars to many children&rsquo;s charities anonymously.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Why don&rsquo;t the papers write about these things? The goodness that he takes time out to do, and his unselfishness in his love of all the children on this planet. This is a very generous person, in every way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Well it was show time and It was arranged that Kenny Ortega, who was Michael&rsquo;s director on this show and a good friend of mine, would drive with me to the stadium. All my friends piled into my car and off we went to see Michael. Having a Special Michael&rsquo;s V.I.P. pass made it real easy for me to get to backstage where the trucks had unloaded Michael&rsquo;s sets and props and costumes. Michael&rsquo;s show travels with 250 people. It takes 4 of the largest planes in the world from Russia and numerous trucks to move the show from city to city. I parked and we went to the hospitality area to get some drinks and food.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We went back to Michael&rsquo;s dressing room where he sees more sick children before the show. In a way, his whole life is dedicated to sick children. These kids adore Michael and during the show in one of the numbers he has about 40 of them come on stage and a little girl gives a flower to a soldier who is coming out of a tank. It&rsquo;s a very touching moment. And YES he travels with the tank!!! He ships it in one of those huge Russian cargo planes from country to country.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All my friends got to meet Michael and were thrilled. Skye and I went to see every show that week and I brought my 2 Swedish girlfriends to two of them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My Friend Arthur was part owner with George in a fabulous disco in Amsterdam &ldquo;Heaven for Sinners&rdquo;, so we all went there after the show. A bunch of the dancers from Michael&rsquo;s show joined us and we kind of took over the place and danced all night long. We did the same thing at a few other clubs during that week. It was party! party! party! and soo much fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Holland his first two shows sold out within 45 minutes. At one show Michael dedicated &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There&rsquo; to his brothers and a young 4 year old boy he met through Make A Wish Foundation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Mystery&rdquo; Drink:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Advertisement (1996) (Image 003-004)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael had a dream. Now he has brought it to life: Mystery, his very own drink, based on his own personal taste. The fresh peach recipe came from him, the packaging came from him--from him, for us. Because Michael&rsquo;s taste is our taste, too. Mystery. A drink comes true. When we presented Mystery at his concerts in Amsterdam for the first time, he was &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; even a little nervous: &quot;I hope my fans and friends around the world enjoy Mystery as much as I do.&quot; No need to worry, Michael. No sooner had discovered the first Michael fans the golden cans, then they were literally grabbing them from the hands of the Mystery team. The result: 500,000 cans gone immediately. Mystery was a hit. And Michael was happy. Once again, his taste has instantly found friends. Incidentally, a look behind the scenes reveals that Michael never wants to be without his drink: backstage, 3 fridges full of ice-cold Mystery are at the ready for Michael and his friends. On the instructions of the king of pop. Now available everywhere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Entertainment Weekly, May 30, 1997:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson&rsquo;s HIStory tour is about to become his Mystery Tour. For the first time since taking the Pepsi challenge in 1984, Jackson has agreed to endorse a new soda. This time it&rsquo;s Mystery Drink, a new beverage from German manufacturer Mystery Drinks GmbH. Already on sale in parts of Europe, the fruit-flavored health drink will become available in Asia, South Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere as Jackson embarks on the second leg of his concert series May 31. According to Udo Schaar, head of PR at Mystery Management (a tour sponsor), the King of Pop not only agreed to help sell the drink but also had a hand in its recipe. &rdquo;At Michael&rsquo;s request, we didn&rsquo;t put anything artificial in it,&rdquo; says Schaar. But don&rsquo;t look for Mystery Drink at your local 7-Eleven, unless Jackson decides to make HIStory in the U.S.: &rdquo;If the tour will go on,&rdquo; says Schaar, &rdquo;we will be there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-05-26/news/9705260042_1_soda-drink-south-africa"><span class="cs8567212B">Chicago Tribune</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Entertainment Weekly says Michael Jackson has agreed to endorse a new soda for the first time since taking the Pepsi challenge in 1984.
