He is invited to take the stage.] This performance was one of the most amazing performances I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my entire life. And I&rsquo;m not just saying that, I really mean it from my heart. It was the highest in artistic presentation and I only wish all of the world leaders could be here to see this, because I think they would think twice when they so quickly send our brothers to the killing fields. Because this is our future &ndash; all the children. And I love you so much. And&hellip; [children loudly chanting his name] I just once again wanted to say thank you very, very much, and from the bottom of my heart I truly and dearly love each and everyone of you. Thank you so much.</span></p></body>
