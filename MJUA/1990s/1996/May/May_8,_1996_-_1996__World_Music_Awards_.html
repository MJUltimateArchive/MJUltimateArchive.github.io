My music serves as my way of making mankind aware of the inquisitives that exist against all people of all the world, and aren&rsquo;t intended to be offensive to any ethnic group. I am not and never have been anti-Semitic. And do me a favor, don&rsquo;t read the tabloids. I love you all very much. And this is our future right here [the children]!

Pudney.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Our awards are all based on sales--no juries, no surveys, but by the record-buying public,&quot; Pudney said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The rest of the world accounts for 70% of record sales. The United States is only 30%. And we&#39;re proud of the fact that we&#39;re the only music show airing in China and Russia.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is the eighth year for the World Music Awards, which is seen in more than 100 countries, but only the fourth year that it&#39;s been on American television. Proceeds from tickets sold for the awards benefit the Princess Grace Foundation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The awards presentation, taped earlier this month, concludes three days of festivities associated with the World Music Awards and is presented under the patronage of Prince Albert of Monaco, who with his sister Princess Stephanie, is among the presenters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She presented the award for the world&#39;s best-selling album (&quot;Thriller&quot;) to Michael Jackson, one of five awards he received.

As lead singer of the Supremes, she recorded 14 consecutive No. 1 songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Other celebrities included Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Seal, TLC and Shania Twain.

For the re-done version, he requested his fans were brought closer to the stage and that a wind machine was put right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In London on 12th May, 1996, Michael went to Evolutions Recording Studio to touch up his World Music Awards performance. Gary Pudney said: &ldquo;He is a real professional and is determined to make his stunning performance even more perfect. Michael is proud of his work and will not rest until he is completely happy with the film.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
