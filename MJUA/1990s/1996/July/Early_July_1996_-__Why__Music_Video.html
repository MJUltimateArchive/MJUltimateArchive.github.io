We were so serious, &#39;cause this was like our video, and we&#39;re like--and our uncle is in it. We didn&#39;t even know if he&#39;s gonna show up or not, not because he&#39;s ever flaked on us, but it was like still surreal. It&#39;s like, &quot;Our uncle&#39;s gonna be in our music video? Is this really gonna happen?&quot; So, it was like, until he we saw him, and we&#39;re like, &quot;He&#39;s there&quot;... And he went straight into play mode. That was the thing with our uncle, because that&#39;s all we did when we were with him, is we cracked jokes, we watched &quot;Three Stooges&quot;, pranks, and all that stuff. So, he was doing that in the videos. He was in that play mode, and we&#39;re like, &quot;No, we have to sing... This is the music video. This is our video.&quot; So, we&#39;re trying to be serious, and he&#39;s trying to make us laugh, and he knew what it needed, because he wanted to capture our dynamic, and that was the thing. You saw that. You saw the dynamic that we have as nephews and him as our uncle, and that&#39;s what was captured in that, and he knew that, that we didn&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jamon (The MJCast):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And he was bringing that out of you during the filming.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Taj:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He was bringing that out to the point--he was so silly, like, I mean--some of that stuff is not even captured on there, like I mean, he was being really silly, and making us laugh. And it was just like--those are the fond memories that I remember of that music video. I have so many memories of that in my life with him, but in terms of for that &quot;Why&quot; music video, that&#39;s all I remember, is him making us laugh, and us being like, &quot;No, you have to be serious. This is our video.&quot; But he knew, he always knows. And he always did know.</span></p></body>
