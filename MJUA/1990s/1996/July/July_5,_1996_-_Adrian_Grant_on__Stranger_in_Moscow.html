I remember it being so hot down in the valley, that it was a welcome relief when Michael was covered in water for the rain scene. But he laughed through it all, and was full of joy. Unfortunately he was surround by a few &lsquo;yes&rsquo; men and he wasn&rsquo;t always told about some of the stuff going on outside of his circle. On this particular day, during a break in shooting, we were sat in his trailer (which was full of candy) and discussed the infamous Jarvis Cocker moment when he interrupted his performance at the Brit Awards. Michael stated that Jarvis Cocker&#39;s invasion of his performance at The Brit Awards was an act of &ldquo;jealousy&rdquo;. I then asked Michael what were his biggest achievements. He stated that working with Quincy Jones, firstly on the &lsquo;Off the Wall&rsquo; album and then onto &lsquo;Thriller&rsquo; was up there, but what stood out most was saving the life of an 8-year-old Hungarian boy, Bella, who was at the risk of dying from cancer. Michael&rsquo;s charity &lsquo;Heal The World&rsquo; paid for a life-saving operation, and Michael told me that it was one of the most important moments of his life.</span></p></body>
