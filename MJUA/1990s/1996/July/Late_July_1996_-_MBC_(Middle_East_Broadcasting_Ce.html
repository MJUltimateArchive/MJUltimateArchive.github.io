I have studied personally all kinds of music, you know, from Africa to India, to Chinese, Japanese, music is music and it is all beautiful. So, I am influenced by all of those different cultures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Question about racism]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: It is cruelty, it&acute;s ugly and I hate it. You are my brother (points out to the children). They are my brothers. If you are black, white, Arab.... we are all the same. I love all races equally.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Little girl: Is it true that you don&rsquo;t like Arabs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: Is it true that I what?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Little girl: That you do not like Arabs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: No, that&acute;s not true at all. I love Arabs, I love all the people of the world. That&rsquo;s a good example now of people make up stories that are not true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Little boy: Would you ever do a concert in Egypt?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: I would love to do a concert in Egypt. I would love the next tour to go to all of your cities. I have only been there at the airport, but it looks like they are wonderful people. (Michael gives a big smile and points his arm to the group of kids) All of you are wonderful people. I am happy to be here.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Question about family wishes]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: I am a very family oriented person and I come from a family of ten children, so I am very used to a family, you know... surrounding, to come around you as a unity. So I don&#39;t think I can live without that bond. So I would love to have a major&hellip; a huge family. I&lsquo;d say a total of twelve... My aunt had 13 children. I have an uncle who had 12 children, and my father had 10 children, and so.. I looove big [families]...... everywhere...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Question about his audiences]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: I can... You can feel the audience. It is love we are talking about. Ooh, you can definitely feel them, that... You hear them, they are swaying and screaming and fainting, the reactions are always lovely....</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Question: About creation and collaborating with others]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: A thought, it is an embryo of a thought, of an idea. It is a brief concept. And then you collaborate with someone. Could be a writer. I say, I want to do this, I want to do that, and I want to do this. You tell him to develop it, because you..... I cannot do it right now, because I got to go on to the next song, the next thing. So they&#39;ll come up with something, working with their ideas and they ́ll come with them back to me ... you go [to see] whether you like it or not. I mean I have done that with pretty much everything that I have done. I am usually there for the concept for the writing. I co-write usually all my pieces that I do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Question about Africa]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: The Garden of Eden was probably in Africa, I am pretty sure. And the people could not have been nicer. (he refers to his visit to South Africa in July 1996 where he attended Mandela&#39;s birthday). And I loved it. I loooooved it. And the music, ooooh, and the rhythm. Seeing petty little kids with the perfect rhythm and .. the way they moved their little bodies.. I was just....Oooh I was amazed. It was GREAT! They gave me everything. They showered me with gifts. You know, clothing, food. And in the hotel... I was in this hotel, right? Big, big, hotel. It had a bowling alley, it had a big game room, big swimming pool. But when I would look out of my window, as far as I could see, there would be people. They even would sleep out there, waiting for me. They would sleep out there!!! All day long they would stand there. At night they would be out there waiting for me. It was just..... They could not have been sweeter. And I loved it. And I am thinking about buying a house there in Africa.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Question about &ldquo;Heal the World&rdquo;]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: With Heal the World we have helped millions, hm, and as we speak we are looking at a hospital in New Jersey. That would be the first Michael Jackson hospital and we would like to make these, throughout the world. That is our goal and our mission. And I hate the word orphanage, but pretty much a housing for a unity of people that are in need, you know.. This is pretty much where my heart is and I would love to continue doing it.</span></p></body>
