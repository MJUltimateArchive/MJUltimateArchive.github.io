The sultan paid an undisclosed amount for the pop star to perform Tuesday night.</span></p><p class="csA117C4CA"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tour officials said it was the first concert Jackson has ever performed where the fans didn&#39;t pay to get in. Jackson kicks off his &quot;World History&quot; tour in South Africa this week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This sort of thing never happens in Brunei. We just had to come to see Michael Jackson, especially as the concert is free,&quot; said Benny Chow, 18, who shouted above the pulsating beat of Jackson&#39;s &quot;Thriller.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The sultan did not attend the concert--he was dining with Prince Charles. Earlier in the day, the sultan and the prince played polo, the sultan&#39;s polo boots delivered to the polo field by helicopter from his 1,778-room palace.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/08/billionaire-parties-perelman-schwarzman-bonderman-lifestyle-wine-wealth_slide_6.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Forbes</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1996 the Sultan of Brunei made birthday party history when he paid pop star Michael Jackson $16 million to play a single concert in Brunei&rsquo;s capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, for the city&rsquo;s 300,000 residents. To accommodate the revelry, a 20-acre plot of land was grafted onto the city&rsquo;s main amphitheater. The event&rsquo;s $27.2 million price tag represented less than 0.1% of his net worth that year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Newspaper snippet from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson entertained the world&#39;s richest man and his subjects in the tiny oil-rich kingdom of Brunei yesterday. About 60,000 people watched his two-hour show, sponsored by the state for the 50th birthday of its ruler, Sir Hasdjkdaj BOkdfsdj. According to Fortune Magazine, Hasdasd is the world&#39;s richest man, worth more than $50 billion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson burst on stage under a rain of sparklers to sing, moonwalk, and dance through a two-hour selection of greatest hits. Well, you would have to sing all your favorites, wouldn&#39;t you? Especially if you had picked up the $25 million Jackson is rumored to have received for his little party performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brunei, a Muslim country, bans the sale of alcohol, hangs drug traffickers and forbids Western practices which cause &quot;moral decay&quot;, but they didn&#39;t mind Jackson because he is seen as a &quot;clean&quot; performer. No trouble with Jackson&#39;s more sugary ballads either. They only cause tooth decay.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And no, he didn&#39;t display any of his crotch-grabbing dance routines, apparently in keeping with the host&#39;s wishes.</span></p></body>
