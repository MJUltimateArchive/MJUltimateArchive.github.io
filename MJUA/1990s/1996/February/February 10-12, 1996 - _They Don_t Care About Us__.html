The marching orders Michael gave to me were that he wanted it to be hard-driven, he wanted the spark, an edge to it. He wanted to see a lot of archival footage in it that would chronicle man&rsquo;s inhumanity to his fellow brothers and sisters. And using that as a starting point, we came up with this idea of Michael being one of many convicts in this prison.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mike said he was gonna try to drive the crowd into a frenzy, and he did. And these two ladies jumped out from the crowd &ndash; security was lacking on one side, so these ladies jumped out, grabbed him, he fell to the ground! (laughing) I picked him up&hellip; and I asked the cameraman later, &lsquo;Did you shoot it?&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;Yeah, and I&rsquo;ve got you too.&rsquo; That was very funny. We did not plan this, that was not rehearsed, they just broke through, and it was exciting&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;Michael has a plane waiting, he has to be in New York with his crew tomorrow, so we&rsquo;re gonna try to get as many shots as we can before Mike has to jet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here in this Brazilian video, you can see the love Brazilian people have for Michael. It&rsquo;s out there. Shooting &lsquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rsquo; with Michael Jackson in Brazil was one of the highlights of my career, and I&rsquo;m including the feature films. I just had a great, great, great time. I think it was historical what we did. It was awesome.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael loves Brazil and the Brazilians and he doesn&rsquo;t need to go halfway around the world to show that shanty towns exist in Rio. This is ridiculous and pathetic. We&rsquo;re not trying to topple the Brazilian government. In the eyes of the world, complicating Michael Jackson&rsquo;s visa is making Brazil appear a ridiculous country &ndash; as if it were a banana republic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1907529,00.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Time (June 29, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Time: What was he like when you worked with him on the video for &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee: Michael was great. He had a sense of humor. He worked hard. People talk about how hard Kobe Bryant works; he didn&#39;t work harder than Michael Jackson. This is what I&#39;ve come to learn. You know, I did a documentary on Kobe, I know him; Michael Jordan, I worked with him a little; Michael Jackson &mdash; when you love what you do that much, it&#39;s not work. So you can go longer and harder and faster and quicker because it&#39;s not a burden. You love what you&#39;re doing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Time: And did you talk to him on the set? Was he accessible?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee: Oh yeah! Michael was a citizen of the world. I said, &quot;Mike, let&#39;s go to Brazil to do this.&quot; And he said, &quot;Let&#39;s go, Spike!&quot; And it&#39;s great when you work with people who say stuff like that &mdash; it&#39;s not a matter of budget. He wanted to do it? We were going!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Time: Had you met him previous to that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee: Yeah, I met him at dinners and stuff like that, but that was the most intimate time I had been with him. Can I tell you a quick story? Michael Jackson called me up and said, &quot;Spike, I want meet you, I&#39;m coming to New York.&quot; I said, &quot;Well where you want to meet?&quot; He says, &quot;I want to come to your house.&quot; I live in Brooklyn! He wants to come to my house! So, Michael Jackson came to my house in Brooklyn, New York &mdash; this was when I was living in Fort Greene. And he said, I want you to direct a video for me. My new album&#39;s coming out, pick a song. So we listened to all the songs and I picked &quot;Stranger in Moscow.&quot; And he said, I don&#39;t want you to do that one. And I said, &quot;Michael, just tell me which one you want me to do! Why ask me to pick one?&quot; And he laughed and he said he wanted me to do &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us.&quot; That&#39;s how it happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://pagesix.com/2018/09/04/a-drug-lord-helped-spike-lee-shoot-michael-jackson-video/"><span class="cs8567212B">Page Six (September 4, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Spike Lee was prepared to pay off a Brazilian drug lord so he could film Michael Jackson in a Rio slum.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But when I reached out for comment, Lee said, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pay a dime. Just asked permission. The guy was a big Michael Jackson fan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&ldquo;To guarantee Michael&rsquo;s security, we had to speak with the drug kingpin Marcinho VP because the Brazilian police refused to climb the hills of the slum,&rdquo; Lee, interviewed in London, told the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brazilian-born Brown University graduate K&aacute;tia Lund, who was working for Lee, was sent to speak to Marcinho and negotiate for protection.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lund was so intrigued by the favela subculture, six years later she co-directed &ldquo;City of God,&rdquo; which was nominated for four Academy Awards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to know Marcinho. He sent me a message that if we decided to make the video with Michael [in the Santa Marta favela], we could lay $1 million on the street, and our film equipment, and no one would touch it,&rdquo; Lee said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee said Marcinho assured him, &ldquo;With Michael Jackson here, this will be the safest place in the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bad 25 Press Conference</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was one of the highlights of my life on a professional level. At the time, Paul Simon had an album out called &ldquo;Rhythm Of The Saints&rdquo; and I had never heard of Olodum, the Brazilian percussion group featured on the album, before hearing it. There is a very strong rhyming track on &ldquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rdquo;, which is where I got my idea to go to Brazil and have Olodum play over it. Now most musicians are not going to go for that, they would say that what they originally did on the record is what it is going to be. Michael was like, &lsquo;OK, let&rsquo;s do this&rsquo;. He had no hesitation. He did not say, &lsquo;let me look at my schedule, how much is it going to cost, who are Olodum?&rsquo; There were a billion reasons to say no, but like that he says &lsquo;let&rsquo;s go&rsquo;&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/385197"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Reuters&rdquo; (February 12, 1996)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200401195704/https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/385197"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop superstar Michael Jackson took a tumble on Saturday (February 10) when thousands of fans heaved against police lines to catch a glimpse of their hero during the filming of a video that officials tried in vain to ban.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The selection of Salvador de Bahia&#39;s historic district of Pelourinho, once a hive of prostitution, as the backdrop for Jackson&#39;s latest video excited legions of fans who pressed against a four-deep cordon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During filming in a narrow street, a woman burst through the cordon, enveloping Jackson in a tight hug.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As two police officers struggled to get her off, the group tumbled to the cobblestones. Jackson, who emerged unscathed, merely brushed down his jeans and the cameras continued to roll.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was just a little hug, it was the others who knocked him down. I felt an urge to do it,&quot; chambermaid Solange Xavier dos Santos said to reporters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite bids to ban the shoot, U.S. film director Spike Lee set cameras rolling just after dawn on Saturday on 200 drummers from percussion band Olodum as they swayed to the heavy beat of Salvador&#39;s &quot;samba-reggae&quot; music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A cavalcade of cars whisked Jackson and two children who are accompanying him on this trip into Pelourinho&#39;s sloping square just after mid-day for his scenes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not everyone in Brazil is so excited about Jackson&#39;s visit. In Rio, where the singer is due to continue filming the video for the song &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot; in a shanty-town on Sunday, officials fear images of poverty might affect tourism and have accused Jackson of exploiting the poor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Earlier this week a Rio judge suspended any filming, but that ruling was later overturned by an injunction.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop singer Michael Jackson thrilled thousands of residents in a poor Rio neighbourhood on Sunday (February 11) while filming a music video which officials had tried to ban.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Relaxed and smiling broadly at thousands perched precariously on shaky roofs, Jackson looked completely at home as he sang to his video &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot; in the patchwork of brick and wood houses, clinging to the hillside.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The city&#39;s shantytowns are normally shunned by outsiders because of drugs and violence, so security was tight throughout the filming. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta shantytown on Saturday night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There had been much speculation over how the health-conscious Jackson would cope with the less-than-perfect sanitary conditions in the shantytown, especially after he arrived in Brazil wearing a black surgical mask.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But on Sunday Jackson seemed carefree about the open drains and rubbish, waving at every opportunity to his screaming admirers from a makeshift patio which commanded panoramic views of Rio&#39;s more obvious tourist attractions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop star Michael Jackson went shopping in Rio de Janeiro Monday (February 12), provoking mob scenes and near hysteria among the crowds who came to see him. His movements around the city were apparently unaffected by reports that his production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city&#39;s shantytowns.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As fans and photographers pressed up against the windows Jackson, wearing a black surgical mask to protect himself from germs, bought compact disks and a Mickey Mouse toy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After finishing his shopping Jackson was led from the score by a phalanx of baton wielding security guards who pushed hundreds of wellwishers aside so that the star could get back into his car. His entourage then drove in convoy through the streets, further tying up Rio&#39;s notoriously congested centre.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/467484633/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Associated Press&rdquo; (February 14, 1996)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200401211659/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/467484633/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has left Rio, but police are still fuming over reports that [the video producers] paid a drug lord for permission to film a music video in a city slum.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gen. Nilton Cerqueira, the Rio state security chief, said neither Jackson nor his representatives consulted his department about security measures for filming in the Dona Marta slum.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The Jackson team could have requested our help, but they didn&#39;t,&quot; Cerqueira said Monday night. &quot;It must be the custom in his country to give money to traffickers.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The drug kingpin of Dona Marta, known as Marcinho VP, told Brazilian reporters he had received a payoff. He also sent the video&#39;s director, Spike Lee, a T-shirt with the names of 23 alleged victims of police violence in the slum.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee admitted producers paid &quot;somebody&quot; for permission to film in Dona Marta, but said he didn&#39;t know if the person was a drug dealer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rio police Chief Helio Luz called Lee, a &quot;fool and a chump&quot; for paying, but Lee disagreed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think I was very smart,&quot; the filmmaker was quoted as saying in an interview Tuesday in the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil. &quot;The police have little authority there. The producers had to negotiate with the right person.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fifty Dona Marta residents were hired at $70 each to protect Lee and Jackson, who also were guarded by 80 police officers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The payoff was no surprise to residents. Drug gangs control Rio&#39;s 660 slums, or favelas, and no one enters or does business there without their consent. &quot;Everyone has his own bureaucracy,&quot; said Jose Luis de Oliveira, head of the Dona Marta Residents Association. &quot;If (Jackson) needed authorization from the Foreign Ministry to enter Brazil, to enter the favela he needed the okay of the traffickers.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson shot scenes on Sunday in Dona Marta for the video of his song They Don&#39;t Care About Us. He ended his four-day visit Monday night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Dangerous Zone&rdquo; fanzine (2001) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229150823/http://en.michaeljackson.ru/civil-disobedience-they-dont-care-about-us/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">February 11: Michael arrives in Rio. A day earlier, Spike Lee already started shooting in the central district of Bahia. The favela is shot in Rio; Michael&rsquo;s dance with the Olodum band (a worldwide known Brazilian drum band consisting of approximately 200 members) and the scene where a young woman breaks through the cordon to hug Michael are shot in the historical part of another Brazilian city, Salvador. The territory where the filming takes place is protected by 1500 policemen. Michael dances for six hours straight (just two months after he collapsed during a rehearsal in New York on December 6, 1995). In the beginning of the video, a girl speaks in Portuguese, &ldquo;Eles nao ligam pra gente,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t care about us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shooting of the first short film was delayed by 20 days, as the Governor of Rio was fearful filming the city&rsquo;s shanty town area of Do&ntilde;a Marta might adversely affect Brazil&rsquo;s chances of hosting the 2004 Olympic Games. Finished promo censored by MTV and VH1 as, although the offending words were muffled, Michael could still be seen mouthing &lsquo;jew me, sue me.&rsquo; Premiered on 22nd March 1996.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">State secretary for Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ronaldo Cezar Coelho complained.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t see why we should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate Rio&#39;s image.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite injunctions made, in the end the court ruled Michael could film his video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sandra Gomez de Barros was excited Michael would be arriving on Brazilian soil again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think his coming will make things better. They&#39;re ashamed of the conditions here, and they&#39;ll have to do something.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael began filming in Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia, before moving on three days later to Rio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Oliviera, the leader of the residents group in Rio, commented:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The Government tried to step in to stop him from showing the misery of people here. They really don&#39;t care about us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Claudia Silva of the press liaison for Rio&rsquo;s office of tourism said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;This process to make Dona Marta better started with Michael Jackson. Now it&rsquo;s a safe favela. There are no drug dealers anymore, and there&rsquo;s a massive social project. But all the attention started with Michael Jackson.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the short film, Michael was accompanied by 200 members of the cultural group Olodum. He is seen wearing one of their tee shirts in the short film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A couple of scenes included were of two women who grabbed Michael to hug him as he was dancing. These were not planned for the original shoot. Michael fell to the ground during these unplanned intrusions on the set.</span></p></body>
