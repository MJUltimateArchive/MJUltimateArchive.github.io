I would like to first welcome all the journalists and press who are covering this historic press conference. And, for reasons I will soon share with you, Kingdom Entertainment represents a long awaited dream come true. My earliest inspiration to be actively involved in all dimensions of the global multimedia explosion was derived from decades of concert tours throughout the world. During these travels, I heard the heartbeats of millions of fans who shared their hopes, their loves and their fears, and, most importantly, their desire for a better life. It was during this time that I began to appreciate that global family entertainment could bring peace, brotherhood and love to the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Until recently, my hectic schedule and outstanding professional commitments left me little time to develop a specific strategy for a fully integrated entertainment company. All that began to change about eighteen months ago, when I first met my friend and partner in the Kingdom Entertainment, HRH Prince Al-Walleed. In short order, it was clear we share the same goals and values, traditional family values. Through Kingdom Entertainment, the Prince and myself will combine human and financial resources to be successful in all phases of the global entertainment revolution. As an example, we intend to be active in theme parks, hotels, animation, feature films, interactive educational entertainment, and, of course, character licensing and merchandising. And, we are really looking forward to this incredible venture.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-03-19-9603200257-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Chicago Tribune&rdquo; (March 19, 1996)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180925141259/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-03-19-9603200257-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Saudi Arabia&#39;s richest investor on Tuesday announced a multimillion dollar show-business joint venture with pop star Michael Jackson.<br/>Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, in a statement sent to Reuters from his head office in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said the business would be called Kingdom Entertainment.<br/>One of their first joint activities would be sponsoring Jackson&#39;s world &quot;History Tour,&quot; the statement said.<br/>It said Kingdom Entertainment planned to pursue investments and development projects in a wide range of entertainment activities including animation, theme parks, theme restaurants, character licensing, television programming, motion pictures and multimedia.<br/>Prince Waleed, 39, is a grandson of Saudi Arabia&#39;s founder, Ibn Saud, and nephew of King Fahd.<br/>He heads the United Saudi Commercial Bank and has made substantial investments in the U.S. bank Citicorp, the Euro Disney theme park near Paris, Canary Wharf in London&#39;s Docklands, U.S. store group Saks Fifth Avenue, the Plaza Hotel in New York and the Four Seasons and Fairmont Hotel chains, Mediaset.Saudi Arabia&#39;s richest investor on Tuesday announced a multimillion dollar show-business joint venture with pop star Michael Jackson.<br/>Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, in a statement sent to Reuters from his head office in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said the business would be called Kingdom Entertainment.<br/>One of their first joint activities would be sponsoring Jackson&#39;s world &quot;History Tour,&quot; the statement said.<br/>It said Kingdom Entertainment planned to pursue investments and development projects in a wide range of entertainment activities including animation, theme parks, theme restaurants, character licensing, television programming, motion pictures and multimedia.<br/>Prince Waleed, 39, is a grandson of Saudi Arabia&#39;s founder, Ibn Saud, and nephew of King Fahd.<br/>He heads the United Saudi Commercial Bank and has made substantial investments in the U.S. bank Citicorp, the Euro Disney theme park near Paris, Canary Wharf in London&#39;s Docklands, U.S. store group Saks Fifth Avenue, the Plaza Hotel in New York and the Four Seasons and Fairmont Hotel chains, Mediaset.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kingdom Entertainment sponsored Michael&rsquo;s HISTORY tour that began in September, 1996.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A 55% stake was made in to &lsquo;Landmark Entertainment&rsquo; &ndash; 5% was owned by Michael personally.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During this period, Poland was being looked at to build a new theme park. Prince Al-Waleed already owned 24% of Euro Disney in France. Michael had been approached by Jacques Tourel, director of the World Trade Centre in Warsaw, to explore the possibilities of the theme park being built.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite drawn up plans and an agreement for it to be built at a military airport with a proposed date given as 1st June, 1999, nothing came of the plans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The airport later refused permission to build it on the site and all other suggestions were turned down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Their first investment was a 50% stake in Landmark Entertainment who were responsible for creating the Spider-Man ride at Islands of Adventure and the Jurassic Park and Terminator 3D attractions at Universal Studios.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael asked them if they could design a theme park that would be open for everyone to visit. Based on Peter Pan, Michael wanted six different named areas:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lost Boys Area, Mermaid Lagoon, Indian Village, Pixie Kingdom, Kid&rsquo;s Creek and Pirates Village with Skull Rock</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two routes were to be put on, either by plane or boat. The latter route would have included caves, waterfalls and idyllic views.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately when Michael and Prince Al-Waleed fell out the idea was shelved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To make up for the disappointment, Landmark later designed a statue showing Michael as Peter Pan!</span></p></body>
