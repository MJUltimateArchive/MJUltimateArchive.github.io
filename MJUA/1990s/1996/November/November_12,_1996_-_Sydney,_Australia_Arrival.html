The Michael Jackson Fan Club--which inadvertently sabotaged the superstar&#39;s plan to arrive on time--turned up to Sydney airport in their thousands.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, emerging form his specially fitted Boeing 707 jet, dressed from head to toe in black and red and wearing a mask, happily obliged. He moved slowly through the crowd, occasionally reaching into the throng for a hand that couldn&#39;t quite make it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Covered in flowers, gifts, posters and packages, Jackson moved quickly to his Tarago, speeding to the city center under police escort.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Again, as the entourage approached his hotel, Jackson stopped the car, got out, and walked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The street was lined with green and yellow balloons, thousands of faces, and a fierce media turnout more in line with a royal tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson shook hands with fans, talked and laughed, and took their presents, their tears, and hysteria.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Outside the Sheraton on the Park Hotel, Jackson was officially greeted by The Bangarra Dance Theatre. The singer stood spellbound as the group performed a piece relating to the sea, distance, and travel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few steps away, schoolchildren nervously awaited their time with the star.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Indoors: more children, more welcomes. The Redfern Public School Choir sang &quot;My Island Home&quot;, a Neil Murray song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson listened carefully, apparently moved by the lyrics.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He said it was beautiful&quot;, choir leader Uma Pitkeathly said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson moved quickly and quietly to his luxury suite overlooking the harbor city. There was no sign of the woman carrying his child, Debbie Rowe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;How did you like the welcome?&quot; a reporter asked Jackson. &quot;I loved it&quot;, Jackson said. &quot;It&#39;s great to be here.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, Melbourne will know today if a 20-meter statue of Jackson will be put up during the visit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last night, Jackson&#39;s concert organizers said they were so happy with the Sydney welcome they would add a similar ceremony to Jackson&#39;s arrival into Melbourne next week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s hotel was being watched over by 52 security staff. Minders say the star was &quot;thrilled by his Australian welcome and is keen to cram in as much sightseeing as possible&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115058/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/australianewsstuff.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;The Daily Telegraph (November 13, 1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The pop star arrived in Sydney yesterday wearing a black surgical mask and his trademark hat and faux military coat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was then mobbed by hysterical fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Scores of fans threw themselves at Jackson&#39;s tour van as it left the airport--forcing the cavalcade to stop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Chaotic scenes also greeted Jackson when he arrived at the Sheraton on the Park Hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Crowds swamped his Tarago, causing a scuffle to break out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson stayed inside the vehicle while bodyguards formed a human barricade around it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the crowd screamed his name, Jackson pointed to a blonde teenager behind the barricades.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A security man opened the car door and he motioned her inside.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She was very shocked but on cloud nine&quot;, said a security man. &quot;The girl who is about 19 got in and Michael kissed her on the forehead--she couldn&#39;t believe her luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some fans have waited outside the hotel since 9am yesterday to catch a glimpse of the superstar--and he didn&#39;t disappoint them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He greeted his fans, signing autographs and shaking hands. He hugged one little boy who pushed through a barrier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He received a colorful welcome from the Aboriginal dance troupe Bangarra, and was presented with a belt of bush strings and feathers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson fan Abbey Axis from Auburn, Sydney said, &quot;I adore him. I&#39;ve been here for hours but it&#39;s been worth the wait.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Friend Patricia Vilegan, IT, from Handwick, said: &quot;I&#39;ve waited for this moment all my life--he&#39;s like air--I can&#39;t live without him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lookalike Michael Downs, 20, from Bondi Junction and Clara Samuelian, 18, from Pachete, both dressed up in sequined jackets and Jackson hats and gloves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Downs said: &quot;My parents told me I&#39;m getting too old for this, but who cares. My mom made my clothes, and I&#39;ll treasure this moment forever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;ve touched him and he&#39;s signed autographs for us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Loretta Telmay, 23, said: &quot;I&#39;ve loved him since I was nine years old.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve taken two weeks off to go to three shows in Sydney and in Brisbane. My parents think I&#39;m mad, because I was booked on a holiday to [fly?] with them, but I cancelled it when I realized Michael was coming. I got his autograph.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Once inside the foyer, Jackson was met by a multicultural choir form Redfern Primary School.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The children sang Christine Ana&#39;s &quot;My Island Horse&quot; while Jackson listened patiently, a young boy companion wearing a Beta basketball cap.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He said it was beautiful and he asked me who wrote the song&quot;, choirmaster Usua Pikeathy said. &quot;I told him it was a Torres Strait Island song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Then he kissed me on the forehead.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also kissed two of the children on the forehead after they presented him with flowers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With that, Jackson and his security entourage headed for his room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The aide also said Jackson wanted his first meal in Australia to be Thai cuisine, his favorite.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s Australian tour has grossed $20 million, with 250,000 tickets sold for nine shows.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The expenses are astronomical&quot;, promoter Paul Dainty said. &quot;This is not looked at as a money-making exercise. You gross a lot of money, but it costs a fortune to stage.&quot;</span></p></body>
