The next album has to be better than the other. [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Well how do you cope with all the hysteria? I mean wherever you go, whether it&#39;s London, whether it&rsquo;s Munich, whether it&rsquo;s New York, whether it&rsquo;s Bangkok, whether it&rsquo;s Japan and even here in Australia, how do you cope with the hysteria?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Um...I know it&#39;s all love, so it makes my heart very happy and I like to give it back, you know through however I can give and it puts a smile on my face to see all the children and all the teenagers and the adults, the demographics. It makes my heart very happy, I love them, I love all the fans very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Well coping with the hysteria, I mean I can&#39;t cope with it, I mean watching all this going on around, I mean the press have been absolutely manic, it&#39;s been manic mania. Can I ask you, do you ever relax? Does Michael Jackson ever relax? Cause I know you&#39;re a workaholic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [smiles] Yes, I am a workaholic. Uh, I don&#39;t relax really, I don&#39;t sleep a lot, I like to continually... my mind never stops. I&#39;m always creating. I never stop. But, I love a good water balloon fight or you know playing around, goofing off, Nintendo games, arcades.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Now Michael, I have to ask you this question. Being possibly the biggest profile in the world, um I guess Princess Diana matches you, you read all these amazing stories about Michael Jackson. I mean I don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re true or not. You read that Michael Jackson&#39;s a weirdo, you read that Michael Jackson&#39;s bizarre, you read that he&#39;s done this, he&#39;s done that. Now I know some of those stories are not true because even I was accused of being at your wedding, and I knew that wasn&#39;t true. But how do you cope, how do you feel about all these stories that are written about you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: It&#39;s very sad, I just want the fans to know and to understand that is not the truth. 99.9% of it is not the truth. And don&#39;t read it, don&#39;t believe it, it&#39;s garbage. It&#39;s tabloid junk, I mean they just simply make it up for greed and money. So please don&#39;t listen to it, it&#39;s trash.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Alright now, there&#39;s one more question I&#39;ve gotta ask you. It&#39;s about a personal friend of yours. But I have gotta ask you this question..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael looks sternly at him]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Molly was granted the interview on the condition that Michael had approval of the questions, and this bit was obviously not pre-approved)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: I am a Stephen King fanatic, I have every book&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael starts to laugh]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: ...that possibly Stephen King has written, um... you can say mind your own business. And I know you&#39;ve done Ghosts with him and I think that&#39;s a sensational piece of work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Did you enjoy doing that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Very much, yes.. yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: I mean that skeleton blew me right out..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Were you there at the premiere?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: No, but I&#39;ve seen it at home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Ooohh</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: It is just amazing. Can I ask you what is Stephen King like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Stephen King is a very gentle sweet kind man. I mean the profile that we see... the books, with his works... he&#39;s nothing like that. He&#39;s very humble.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Ahhh... A lot of people judge me the same way. I&#39;m pretty simple... I love to create. I love to make magic. I love to create the unexpected. You know. And Stephen, he&#39;s just wonderful, he&#39;s not bizarre or strange or weird. He&#39;s a loving person.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: And great to work with?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Great to work with. Together, he and I wrote Ghosts and had fun doing it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Alright now, listen, I never normally asks for autographs. But this is a Stephen King book and it&#39;s called Insomnia, and I&#39;m sure over the last week I&#39;ve had no sleep...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael starts to laugh]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: ...with the Michael Jackson thing. Can you sign this book of Stephen King for me?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Sure. Sure. [Takes the book and signs it]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Thanks very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Thank you Molly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Enjoy Australia.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: And we look forward to more work from Michael Jackson, more records...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Thank You.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: ..and being the biggest star if not the biggest star in the world, and entertaining everyone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: All my love to everyone, thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Molly: Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Molly Meldrum, interviewer, autobiography, &ldquo;The Never, Um, Ever Ending Story: Life, Countdown and Everything in Between&rdquo; (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/libro-michael-jackson-molly-meldrum-the-never-um-ever-ending-story.128700/"><span class="cs8567212B">translated Spanish excerpts</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190523194157/https://www.mjhideout.com/forum/threads/libro-michael-jackson-molly-meldrum-the-never-um-ever-ending-story.128700/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the [&ldquo;HIStory&rdquo;] tour began, I expected to be able to do another face-to-face interview with Michael, but nothing was confirmed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">... When I arrived at the Sheraton Hotel in Sydney, everyone was taking pictures and shouting: &#39;Molly, are you going to the wedding?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;What wedding?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Michael Jackson&#39;s wedding&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I laughed. I thought the press had gone completely crazy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next morning, November 15, when I arrived in Melbourne, the story was already known. Michael Jackson had married Debbie Rowe. My phone was smoking and CNN wanted to know details about the wedding.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before the supposed wedding, I had asked the Daily Telegraph of Sydney to write a story about Michael Jackson. I wrote a sensitive article about how hard it was to be MJ, and how no one else could understand it. The article was published in the Saturday edition.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At 5.45 that afternoon, less than three hours before the one-hour special went on the airwaves, we received a call from Channel Nine saying that Michael had read that article, and he liked it so much that he wanted to do a live interview with me during the special. &quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, despite the fact that Michael appeared in time to record the interview, the lights went out in Sydney and by the time they could solve the problem, it was too late. A world exclusive was lost because of a fuse.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was so disappointed that he agreed to do an interview in Brisbane the following Tuesday. On this occasion too, I had to stick to the previously agreed questions, but this time it was Michael who answered them, not his manager.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, I left the script in my last question.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I could feel Michael&#39;s escorts start to get scared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;It&#39;s a personal friend of yours ...&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I could see Michael more uncomfortable at every moment ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;I&#39;m a fan of Stephen King. Can I ask you what you think? &#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808122745im_/http://0101.nccdn.net/1_5/287/3ae/2fc/12412151901397598.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Herald Sun&quot; (1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...It was a meeting Samantha Riley had been waiting for since she was a teenager, when she wore out her copy of Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the backstage encounter was so fleeting, the pair barely had a chance to exchange more than a few sentences.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And, typical of Jackson and his entourage, there were several delays before it could take place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;s someone I&#39;ve always admired and I&#39;m a big fan, but it would have been nice to get away from the entourage and all the cameras and just have a couple of minutes to chat&quot;, Riley says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;As it was, it wasn&#39;t much more than a photo opportunity and a short conversation before he had to go off with Molly Meldrum to do an interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love his music and I loved the concert, but personally, I just didn&#39;t have time to get an impression of what he&#39;s really like.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Riley, along with iron man Trevor Hendy and his children, had been scheduled to meet Jackson last Sunday and present him with an Akubra hat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The meeting was cancelled at the last minute when Jackson refused to fly from Sydney to Brisbane through heavy storms.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The re-scheduled meeting the following day was also cancelled, and it wasn&#39;t until about an hour before Jackson&#39;s Brisbane show at a packed ANZ Stadium on Tuesday night that the three came face to face.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Riley said Jackson was polite, but he seemed confused about who she was until his minders filled him in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hendy, who says he was always a minor fan, says meeting Jackson has transformed him into a major fan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was totally impressed by him; he had this real aura about him&quot;, he says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was very quiet--but after I&#39;d seen the concert, I realized that he speaks through his music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve never encountered anything like the presence he had.&quot;</span></p></body>
