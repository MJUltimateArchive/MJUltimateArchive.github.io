Each song was accompanied by a costume change from the video--this was live MTV. We got the red jacket with the zips, the padded white number, and, of course, the white glove... Jackson then moved on to his more recent work--&quot;Black or White&quot;, and then some stuff from &quot;HIStory&quot;. Now, this is where things got pretty problematic.
