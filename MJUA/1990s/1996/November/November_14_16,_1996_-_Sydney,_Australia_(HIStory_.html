Hopefully they&#39;re some of yours as well&quot;, Jackson said before leaping into a medley of tracks from &quot;Off the Wall&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Earlier, Jackson abandoned plans to visit Australia&#39;s pluckiest kid because of fears the child is too ill for all the attention.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An emotional Jackson had planned to visit six-year-old Tjandamurra O&#39;Shane--who was doused with petrol and set alight in the grounds of a Cairns school last month--but the child&#39;s father, Timothy O&#39;Shane, warned against it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. O&#39;Shane told Jackson&#39;s minders that his son was too sick to deal with the media circus following the singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Management at the Royal Children&#39;s Hospital in Brisbane said it was also concerned about the effect on Tjandamurra&#39;s slow but steady progress.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson said he respected the family&#39;s wishes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, Jackson has sent his best wishes to Tjandamurra in the form of a personalized card, an autographed copy of his HIStory CD, posters, flowers, and other gifts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sourced say Jackson&#39;s card wishes Tjandamurra a &quot;speedy recovery&quot; and that the superstar finds the youngster&#39;s long road to recovery &quot;brave and inspiring.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yesterday, in day two of Jackson-watch, it is believed the singer and several members of his entourage, did an impromptu early morning tour though Sydney.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was said to have left his $3500-a-night suite at 4am, and drive across the Harborough Bridge to the site of Luna Park and back to the Opera House.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Flatley, dancer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35259896/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/secret-life-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">NBC Dateline (February 5, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (Note: This is before one of the concerts on his Australian leg, not necessarily Sydney) [Image 001]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Dateline NBC:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [Michael Jackson and Michael Flatley], both justly famous for their footwork, had met back in 1996 when they were each on tour in Australia.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Flatley: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I walked into his dressing room, and he said-- &quot;How&#39;s the greatest dancer in the world?&quot; &nbsp;And naturally, I replied, &quot;I was gonna ask you the same thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105932/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/historyaustraliatour.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;People Weekly&quot; magazine</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Debbie Rowe ambled into Sydney airport after a 14-hour flight from Los Angeles last Wednesday, few took note of what was, in hindsight, a historic moment. Already six months pregnant with Michael Jackson&#39;s child, Rowe, 37, would soon go from being an anonymous dermatologist&#39;s aide to the Peter Pan of Pop&#39;s blushing bride.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The marriage, kept secret even from some of his entourage, took place after the star performed in his brilliantly choreographed concert before 40,000 fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Thursday night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the sell-out show... Jackson returned to the Sheraton on the Park hotel. &quot;He went up the steps and stood and waved to the media&quot;, says a spokeswoman for promoter Paul Dainty. &quot;He had his mask on and said everything with those wonderful eyes.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then he disappeared inside, where a cocktail party was in full swing. Attended by the power-suits of the local rock industry, including Molly Meldrum, Brian Walsh (Australian publicist for Jackson) and some of the singer&#39;s 200-strong entourage, it lasted until about 3 AM. &quot;Everybody arrived from the concert&quot;, a Sheraton employee told Sydney&#39;s 2Day FM, &quot;and they had all been very merry, they had been drinking all night.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s bride-to-be, who miscarried earlier this year after she and Jackson first conceived, was hidden from view. &quot;I&#39;d say she was preparing for the wedding&quot;, said record marketing director Stephen Millard. &quot;She&#39;s a very nice girl&quot;, adds Dainty&#39;s spokeswoman. &quot;It&#39;s weird--she&#39;s normal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...With Jackson&#39;s personal adviser, Charles Bobbit, and world tour promoter Marcel Avram standing by, Jackson and Rowe were married just after midnight in the Sheraton&#39;s Presidential Suite. The bride, says Brian Walsh, &quot;wore white. I know that Michael&#39;s hair and make-up people attended to Debbie prior to the wedding.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They are really happy and Michael&#39;s ecstatic about the prospects of being a father--and now he has the wife as well&quot;, says Millard. Rowe, he adds, is &quot;very relaxed. She&#39;s a really gentle person, very genuine, and very loving.&quot; A friend of Rowe&#39;s agrees. &quot;She&#39;s the antithesis of Lisa Marie--she never wears lipstick, never gets her hair done, drives a pick-up truck.&quot; And that, according to a source close to Jackson, is exactly what the singer wants. &quot;There&#39;s no question Michael wants this child to have a mother and father--that&#39;s why he got married.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But whether it is a match made in Hollywood heaven or not, Jackson still wants Hollywood heaven or not, Jackson still wants &quot;Debbie to see Sydney&quot;, says Dainty&#39;s spokeswoman, but &quot;he won&#39;t go out with her.&quot; Jackson, however, has insisted he see the city and the people &quot;he absolutely loves&quot;, says Millard. &quot;He thinks there&#39;s more of an understanding here of him than anywhere.&quot; Between daytime rests at his hotel, Jackson plans a trip to the zoo, and while in Brisbane this week will visit Tjandamurra O&#39;Shane, the 6-year-old torched in a Caims schoolyard a month ago. Jackson has also asked Sony for a $399 CD-ROM PlayStation as a gift for the child.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115058/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/australianewsstuff.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; (1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...[After the concert, Michael] slipped through the hotel&#39;s back door at 7:15pm to avoid the crash of fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson left through the front door 15 minutes later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[article cut off] packed and he was waving to everybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Tour promoter Paul Dainty, who accompanied Debbie to the sell-out gig last night, also held a private party at the hotel which went on until the early hours of this morning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808121100im_/http://0101.nccdn.net/1_5/0a9/0d1/03c/12412153847186.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; (1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the SCG, an even greater journey was taken in a show where understatement was replaced by grand gestures.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before Michael Jackson even made it to the stage, a computer game-like rollercoaster ride through history fractured shots of major figures of the past and present, interspersed with shots of Jackson. He then emerged from a capsule in a gold space suit and launched into his newish song &quot;Scream&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After 10 minutes, he unzipped his jacket. Five minutes later, he disappeared. By the time he returned, sex had arrived via security clad women.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson wielded a machine gun. Sex, violence, and a moonwalk... he had it all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Marva Hicks, &ldquo;HIStory World Tour&rdquo; &ldquo;I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You&rdquo; duet singer and backup singer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://issuu.com/la_wattstimes/docs/lawt-6-24-10"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;L.A.

We were performing in Sydney, Australia. At that evening&rsquo;s performance on the day that I found out she was sick, MJ pulled me aside after our prayer circle. He always joined us for prayer circle. He thanked me for doing the show that night considering how worried I was about my mother. And he assured me they would get me home ASAP. I left on a flight the next morning. And the next day, flowers arrived at the hospital for my mother &mdash; from Michael Jackson. I am loyal to him to this day because of his kindness. What I [appreciate] most about him is the dynamics of his creativity. Being around him was electric! It was exciting to be a part of building this show.</span></p></body>
