		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Statement on Relationship with Debbie Rowe</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.eonline.com/news/33727/michael-jackson-father"><span class="cs8567212B">E! News (November 4, 1996)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, it turns out that this time the kid is his son. The King of Pop confirmed today that he is getting an heir early next year. The mother is Debbie Rowe--he&#39;s identifying her only as a &quot;longtime friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I am thrilled that I will soon be a father and am looking forward, with great anticipation to having this child....this is my dream come true,&quot; Jackson said in a statement. He added a plea to the press to: &quot;Please respect my privacy and that of Debbie and the child.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;The reports speculating that Ms. Rowe was artificially inseminated, and that there is any economic relations, are completely false and irresponsible. Michael regrets that the news of Debbie&#39;s pregnancy was accomplished by several false and distorted reports and speculations,&quot; Jackson&#39;s spokeswoman Christine Holevas said in a press release.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105932/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/historyaustraliatour.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Debbie Rowe has agreed that when the child is born, she will hand it over to Michael for him to bring up alone in France. While Debbie is expected to be paid handsomely for her services, Michael&#39;s management has denied there is &quot;any economic relationship&quot; and that the child was conceived through in-vitro fertilization.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is believed to have promised to buy the divorcee a house, but Debbie insists she is not doing it for the money. &quot;She just really loves Michael and wants to give him this as a gift of love&quot;, a friend says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael has tried to keep it quiet for the sake of Debbie--he wanted to keep it a secret until after the baby was born. But he is so proud, he wants the world to know.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Under the deal, Michael will have custody of the child, with the baby&#39;s mother having visiting rights only.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She is having the baby for Michael. It is not like they are a couple or plan to be. She is doing this for him to have his own child&quot;, the friend says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie has been boasting she and Michael conceived the baby naturally, but close friends claim it was by IVF. Jackson and Debbie visited the offices of Los Angelse fertility expert Dr. Hal Danzer together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has known Debbie for more than 15 years and she has remained a confidante through his difficult times. When Michael first went to ground during the child abuse allegations several years ago, Debbie was one of the few friends with whom he could talk.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And when his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley broke down, it was Debbie who was by his side. So when he confessed his greatest wish was to have a child, she happily offered her services. She flew first class to be with Michael in Singapore, and when she returned from the trip, Debbie was proudly showing off a picture in her wallet of Michael tenderly running her belly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He is so excited&quot;, she told a friend. &quot;He keeps saying how he can&#39;t wait and nine months is too long.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie has also revealed that Michael plans to hire nannies to help him care for the baby. She will have nothing more to do with the upbringing of her child after the birth, apart from occasional visits.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie, who lives alone in a one-bedroom apartment in California, stunned friends when she announced she was pregnant, even though she has been divorced for years and does not have a boyfriend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie will be by Michael&#39;s side as he continues with his world tour in Hawaii, Japan and Australia.</span></p></body>
