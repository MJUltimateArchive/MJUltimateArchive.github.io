joined the entourage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 23-year-old dance instructor watched as a small army of security men took their designated places and waited, hands behind backs, for Jackson to alight the plane.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Ansett Boeing 767, carrying 170 people, was hired by Jackson at a cost of $30,000 for the two-hour flight from Brisbane.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Baitz looked on enviously as the megastar kissed and hugged three children bearing flowers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But with only three meters separating him from his idol, temptation proved too great.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Baitz held up a HIStory poster, and when Jackson beckoned him forward, he jumped the barricade, and ran the gauntlet of security men.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just told him how much I appreciated him and that I&#39;d loved him since The Jackson Five&quot;, Baitz said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And he just said to me, &#39;Thank you, thank you&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Baitz then asked Jackson to autograph the poster, but his marker pen did not work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time he found a pen that worked, the star and his entourage of 170 were already on their way to the Grand Hyatt Hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Screams, excited tears, and pure white doves met pop superstar Michael Jackson as he swept into Melbourne yesterday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With enough black and red balloons for an Essendon final and security fit for a president, the masked singer thrilled 500 faithful fans at the Grand Hyatt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the crowd surged behind metal barriers, a bird flew into Jackson&#39;s hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fans had begun their stake-out about 8am, girls with &quot;I love MJ&quot; on their faces, pictures in excited hands.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few clutched roses behind barriers as black-suited staff with secret service earplugs patrolled the area.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two hours before Jackson arrived, they began chanting: &quot;We want Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eight baskets of mainly white doves waited as children from the National Boys Choir filed in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hundreds of black and red balloons escaped skyward.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rafi Recht, 14, from the Royal Children&#39;s Hospital, moonwalked in his black hat and white glove.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The arrival near, about 500 youngsters packed the footpath, spilling on to the Russell lit median strip.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Children&#39;s Hospital patients were handed white doves, and held them gingerly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, at 5:38pm, a van opened, and the singer walked in to deafening screams.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He watched doves fly by and did a small dance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He hugged little Rafi, held a dove, walked towards the adoring crowd, and set the bird free.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rafi and the singer remained close until the lad, believed to be seriously ill, returned to his hospital bed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Looking towards the battery of cameras, Jackson blew a kiss and gave a peace sign. Two lost doves belted themselves against a window.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson greeted young patients and watched Wurundjeri tribe dancers circle with spears.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A bird flew into Jackson&#39;s hands before he entered the foyer where the choir sang &quot;Heal the World&quot; and &quot;Victorian School For the Deaf&quot; children performed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Overjoyed, trying to clap while holding the bird, Jackson shouted: &quot;Excellent!
