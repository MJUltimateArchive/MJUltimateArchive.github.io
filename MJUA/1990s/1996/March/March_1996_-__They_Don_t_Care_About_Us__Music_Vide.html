And Michael said, &lsquo;You do music videos?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yeah, Michael, I do lots of music videos.&rsquo; So I gave him the reel with the stuff I&rsquo;d done, and he said, &lsquo;Great!&rsquo; Then the next time he called me back he said, &lsquo;I want you to do Stranger in Moscow, but let&rsquo;s do They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us first.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The original concept was not meant to be two videos, the prison stuff was going to be combined with the stuff we shot in Brazil. The marching orders Michael gave to me were that he wanted it to be hard-driven, he wanted the spark, an edge to it. He wanted to see a lot of archival footage in it that would chronicle man&rsquo;s inhumanity to his fellow bothers and sisters. And using that as a starting point, we came up with this idea of Michael being one of many convicts in this prison.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Everything he&rsquo;s involved in, he wants it to be the very best it ever was. That&rsquo;s a great attitude, and it&rsquo;s also a great responsibility. And in everything he does, he told me, &lsquo;Spike, I want this to be the best&rsquo; &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t call it a music video &ndash; &lsquo;I want this to be the best short film ever!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Okay, Mike!&rsquo;&rdquo; (laughing)</span></p></body>
