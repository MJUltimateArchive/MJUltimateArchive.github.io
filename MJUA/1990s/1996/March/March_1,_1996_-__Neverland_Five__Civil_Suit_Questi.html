In what was a complete win for the singer, the jury even awarded Jackson $60,000 in a countersuit that charged some of those employees stole items from the estate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to their lawsuit, an administrative assistant, a maid and three bodyguards who formerly worked for the pop star claimed Jackson and six other employees harassed, threatened and fired them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The plaintiffs say they were forced out of Neverland because they testified against Jackson before a grand jury investigating whether the singer molested a 13-year-old boy. The suit alleged Jackson was so paranoid that he bugged his home to find out what employees were saying about the charges.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The singer&#39;s attorneys filed a countersuit, saying the five quit voluntarily and were not harassed. It also claimed two of the former workers--the maid and a bodyguard--stole sketches, personal notes, hats, toys and candy from the ranch, selling some items to tabloid newspapers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The jury of 10 women and two men agreed with Jackson. They ruled Tuesday there was no evidence to support the allegations brought against Jackson or the six aides mentioned in the lawsuit by his former employees. Jurors also decided that items were stolen and awarded Jackson the 60 grand. &quot;We&#39;re happy to be finally and fully vindicated,&quot; said Jackson attorney Steve Cochrane.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The trial commenced in September and was handed to the jury last Thursday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was never charged with child molestation. In 1994, Jackson settled the original civil suit filed by the boy. While the terms were confidential, the amount has been estimated between $15 and $50 million.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Synopsis/Analysis of the Civil Suit, MichaelJacksonAllegations.com (all sources at bottom)</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">The so called &ldquo;Neverland 5&rdquo; was a group of five former employees of Jackson: </span><span class="cs43C038A">Kassim Abdool, Ralph Chacon, Adrian McManus, Sandy Domz</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Melanie Bangall</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> who sued Jackson in the 90s alleging wrongful termination. Three of these five people &ndash; Abdool, Chacon and McManus &ndash; testified for the prosecution at the Jackson&rsquo;s 2005 trial in support of their &ldquo;prior bad acts&rdquo; case. They claimed that during their employment at Neverland (1990/1991 to 1994) they witnessed Jackson behave inappropriately with children. Former security guard, Chacon claimed he witnessed Jackson sexually molesting J</span><span class="cs43C038A">ordan Chandler</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> on one occasion [1]. Former security guard, Abdool, who worked directly with Chacon on the same shift, and described himself as Chacon&rsquo;s friend, did not make that same claim, but he supported &nbsp;Chacon&rsquo;s allegations by claiming he, too witnessed some of the improprieties Chacon claimed to have witnessed [2]. Former maid, McManus claimed that she witnessed Jackson behave inappropriately with Jordan Chandler, Brett Barnes and Macaulay Culkin [3]. None of these people ever reported or even mentioned what they had allegedly seen at the time that the alleged molestations and improprieties supposedly occurred. </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">These stories first surfaced in the spring of 1994, more than half a year after the Chandler scandal went public.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">In actuality, on December 7, 1993 Adrian McManus testified under oath in a deposition for the Chandler civil case that she never observed any inappropriate behavior or any form of sexual behavior by Jackson towards Jordan Chandler or any other child. She even said she trusted Jackson so much that she would have no problem with leaving her son alone with him. When Jackson&rsquo;s attorney, Thomas Mesereau confronted her with her 1993 deposition in 2005, McManus simply claimed that she did not tell the truth in that 1993 deposition [3].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chacon and Abdool first made allegations against Jackson when they were subpoenaed by the prosecution to appear in front of the two Grand Juries which were convened to examine the allegations against Jackson in the spring of 1994. Abdool appeared before the Los Angeles Grand Jury and Chacon appeared before the Santa Barbara Grand Jury. Conveniently, this was also the first time they claimed to have confided in each other about what they had allegedly observed, although they worked on the same shift and they were supposedly friends. Prior to this time they never mentioned to anyone that they witnessed any wrongdoing in regards to Jackson. In fact, on January 13, 1994 Abdool signed a statement for Jackson&rsquo;s representatives that stated he had never seen Jackson touch any child in a sexually inappropriate manner or in any way that could be construed as sexual [2].</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Chacon and Abdool changed their stories and first came up with claims of improprieties and child molestation, Chacon was deposed by District Attorney, Thomas Sneddon and Detective Russ Birchim for the Chandler case. At the time, Chacon asked Birchim for money to help him relocate his wife. Birchim delivered the money and the gun permit that Chacon had also requested [3]. Jackson&rsquo;s lawyer, Thomas Mesereau asked Chacon about it during Jackson&rsquo;s 2005 trial. First Chacon said he did not remember it but when Mesereau showed him a transcript of his deposition, he slowly acknowledged his prior testimony, stating it </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;probably&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> happened. When questioned by Sneddon on redirect examination Chacon suddenly remembered everything clearly. However, Sneddon quickly cut him off, stating </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not important&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. You indicated that you may have asked Sergeant or now Commander Birchim for money for your wife &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. Yes, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. &mdash; do you recall? Do you remember why that was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. Yes, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. Why was that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. Well, my wife&rsquo;s sister-in-law had just died, and &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. That&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ll withdraw the question. That&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s not important. [1]</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the trial Chacon disclosed that towards the end of his employment by Jackson he had conflicts with the star&rsquo;s personal bodyguards, called the Office of Special Services (OSS) because, according to him, they interfered with his work. Chacon admitted that he and Abdool were upset and dissatisfied because they found out that a new security staff for Jackson was paid more than they were. [1]</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">During his testimony it was also revealed that in 1994 Chacon was in financial difficulties, owing money on a lost lawsuit. Although documents were shown to prove this, Chacon claimed he did not remember that ruling. [1] Jackson&rsquo;s lawyer, Thomas Mesereau also revealed that Chacon owed money on back child support and was missing payments on his rent, but had bragged to his landlady, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Linda Allen</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, that with a lawsuit against Jackson he would win millions and would even be able to drive around in a 450 Mercedes. Chacon denied these claims. [1]</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shortly after that time, Abdool and Chacon (McManus joined later) went to a civil attorney, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Michael Ring</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, who on their behalf, on December 2, 1994, filed a civil lawsuit against Jackson and other employees of the star demanding $16 million in damages (eventually all five people of the &ldquo;Neverland 5&rdquo; group). They claimed that during their employment they were harassed and intimidated, which resulted in emotional distress and various medical problems that &nbsp;made them </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;emotionally disabled&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and unable to work. They also claimed that they were wrongfully terminated by Jackson. Jackson counter-sued and eventually Chacon and McManus were found guilty of stealing from Jackson&rsquo;s property [1] [2] [3].</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the civil trial the Neverland 5 and their attorney were sanctioned $66,000 for lying during their depositions and on the stand and for discovery violations (ie. for hiding evidence from Jackson&rsquo;s lawyers). Judge Zel Canter, who presided over the civil trial, left the bench after stating he was disgusted [4]. The jury rejected the wrongful termination lawsuit against Jackson and ordered the Neverland 5 to pay him damages. The court also imposed attorneys fees and costs of $1.4 million against plaintiffs. As of the time of their testimony in 2005 none of them paid the damages to Jackson. According to his testimony, after the verdict in the civil trial Chacon filed for bankruptcy. [1] [2] [3]</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the 2005 trial, while on the stand, Chacon denied he knew anything about the amount of money his lawyer demanded from Jackson at the civil trial. However, documents from a deposition of Chacon at the time showed that not only did he know of the $16 million demand from the entertainer, but at one point Chacon even said that $16 million was not enough. Later, on re-cross examination Chacon admitted he knew how much money was demanded in the lawsuit. He also said in a deposition that Jackson should compensate him for the rest of his life [1].</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before their lawsuit in the 90s, under the direction of their attorney, Michael Ring the Neverland 5 contacted a tabloid broker, Gary Morgan from the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Splash News and Picture Agency</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> to sell slanderous stories about Jackson and children and also about Jackson and his then wife, Lisa Marie Presley. Morgan arranged interviews with magazines, such as </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Star</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;and TV programs, such as </span><span class="cs43C038A">Inside Edition</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [1] [2] [3]. According to McManus&rsquo; 2005 testimony, $32,000 or more was received for their stories and almost all of it went to Ring, to finance their civil lawsuit, from which they hoped to get millions of dollars [3]. Chacon admitted that before they went to </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Star</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> they also talked to a certain journalist, Victor Gutierrez [1]. Abdool also talked about this connection, stating that he met Gutierrez once and they had a two, three hours conversation [2]. McManus testified that Gutierrez </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;was going to try to help us in our lawsuit&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [3]. For why this connection is significant, please<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://michaeljacksonallegations.com/victor-gutierrez-and-his-role-in-the-allegations-against-michael-jackson/"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://michaeljacksonallegations.com/victor-gutierrez-and-his-role-in-the-allegations-against-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">read our article about Gutierrez</span></a></span><span class="cs31D24DEE">.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the stand Abdool claimed that he, Chacon and McManus did not discuss and harmonize their stories in advance that they were selling to tabloids. However, this was contradicted by Chacon&rsquo;s testimony in which he admitted they made drafts about their stories in Ring&rsquo;s office about what they were going to tell tabloids [2] [3].</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides making money, another purpose for these interviews and the Neverland 5&rsquo;s claims of having witnessed Jackson in improper situations with children: putting pressure on him and trying to make him settle the case. Although at Jackson&rsquo;s 2005 trial Chacon claimed not to have known anything about such tactics, he admitted it would not surprise him if that was the case.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;Q. BY MR. MESEREAU: At the time you and Mr. Abdool and Ms. McManus and your lawyer went to a tabloid to give a story about Mr. Jackson, do you know whether or not your lawyer was trying to negotiate money from Mr. Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. No, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. Do you know whether or not your lawyer was trying to pressure Mr. Jackson by threatening bad publicity?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. No, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. Did you ever hear of anything like that going on?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. No, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. Okay. So if that went on, you&rsquo;d be shocked, true?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. Probably not, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Q. Probably not?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">A. I guess not, no. [1]</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of Chacon&rsquo;s complaints in the 1995 lawsuit against Jackson was that Jackson caused him emotional distress because he </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;stared at him all the time&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> </span><span class="cs43C038A">[1].</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Because of that he claimed he was entitled to damages. When his claim was found to be false Jackson&rsquo;s attorney, Tom Mesereau asked him why he said that if it was not true. Chacon&rsquo;s answer was: </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ldquo;I guess just to say it&rdquo; [1].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the civil trial in the 1990s, another former employee of Jackson&rsquo;s, Francine Orosco testified that McManus asked her to say she witnessed a male employee of Jackson sexually harass McManus. Orosco also testified that she visited McManus at home during their employment and McManus showed her a room filled with watches, posters, clocks, sunglasses, T-shirts and laundry baskets filled with Michael Jackson&rsquo;s clothes and other items she stole from Neverland. It was also found that McManus stole a drawing Jackson made of Elvis Presley and sold it for $1000 to Gary Morgan from </span><span class="cs43C038A">Splash</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [3].</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;It also emerged that earlier McManus and her husband were ordered to pay $17,000 each in another lawsuit, in which it was ascertained that they stole money from an estate that was set-up for minor relatives of McManus. They willfully and maliciously defrauded Shane and Megan McManus, a nephew and a niece of Adrian McManus, out of their money. They were sued by Rosalie Hill, the children&rsquo;s guardian ad litem. Judge Richard A. St. John found that the the money was held in the trust for the benefit of those two children and McManus and her husband dissipated those funds [3] [4].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sources:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[1] Ralph Chacon&rsquo;s testimony at Michael Jackson&rsquo;s 2005 trial (April 7, 2005)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[2] Kassim Abdool&rsquo;s testimony at Michael Jackson&rsquo;s 2005 trial (April 25, 2005)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[3] Adrian McManus&rsquo; testimony at Michael Jackson&rsquo;s 2005 trial (April 7-8, 2005)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[4] Supplemental Brief In Support Of Opposition To District Attorney&rsquo;s Motion For Admission Of Alleged Prior Offenses (March 25, 2005)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.sbscpublicaccess.org/docs/ctdocs/032505suppopp1108.pdf"><span class="cs8567212B">http://www.sbscpublicaccess.org/docs/ctdocs/032505suppopp1108.pdf</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://www.sbscpublicaccess.org/docs/ctdocs/032505suppopp1108.pdf"></a><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Original Article Link: <a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://michaeljacksonallegations.com/ralph-chacon-kassim-abdool-and-adrian-mcmanus/"><span class="cs8567212B">http://michaeljacksonallegations.com/ralph-chacon-kassim-abdool-and-adrian-mcmanus/</span></a></span></p></p></body>
