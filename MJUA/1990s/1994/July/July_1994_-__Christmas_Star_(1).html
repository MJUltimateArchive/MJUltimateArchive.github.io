There was really no discussion of a full Christmas album or anything like that, rather this was the only Christmas song that I am aware of that we recorded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think it was either July or August of 1994, and it was hot in New York. Really hot. Michael wanted the studio to feel like Christmas - and in traditional MJ fashion nothing could be small. We made several phone calls (this was before Google) and wound up bringing a set design company in to completely transform Hit Factory Studio 1 into a winter wonderland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Over the course of a couple days they brought in fake snow, a Christmas Tree, a sleigh, Christmas lights and endless decorations. We booked a kid&#39;s choir to provide the vocals, and Michael purchased gifts for all of the kids. The gifts were beautifully wrapped and readied. There was just one missing piece to the puzzle - Santa. Michael looked at me and said, &quot;Brad, you be Santa.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After working with Michael for this many years, you sort of got used to out-of-the-ordinary requests. He once wanted to try everything at McDonalds. Everything. We brought him a couple large sacks of every sandwich, salad, fry, pie and ice cream that McDonalds sells for him to sample. I imagined how much the McDonald&#39;s corporate folks would have loved that photo!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had seen his generosity countless times, and heard story after story. I had seen the kids from Make-A-Wish come to Neverland. I had seen him order pizza for the fans that hung out on the street outside of the Hit Factory. I had seen him be generous with his time and money - in countless ways - to his fans, friends and recording team. But I&#39;m more a behind-the-scenes guy, not a Santa.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael, do I really have to be Santa?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Yes, we even got you a Santa suit! You need to be Santa.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, seriously... I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m the best choice for this job.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Brad - I want you to be Santa!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Can I be totally honest with you? By this point in my career I had worked side-by-side with Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Siedah Garrett, Bruce Swedien, David Foster, Stevie Nicks, Elizabeth Taylor, George Michael, Slash and Brian May - to name a few - but putting on a Santa suit and giving out gifts with Michael was one of the most nerve-wracking things I had ever done. I have no idea why I was so nervous, but it was way out of my comfort zone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The afternoon of the choir vocals I was given the suit and we briefly discussed where I would sit, where Michael would be, etc. Brian Vibberts was assigned as one of my Elves. You have never seen a more happy Elf! He as made for this role. I was a bit more hesitant, but also excited... in a nervous sort of way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We went out into the studio full of kids, parents and crew, took our seats and started handing out gifts. The nerves disappeared almost immediately. Generosity is a powerful force. So is humor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We gave out each gift, and by the time it was over I was ready to head over the Rockefeller Center and keep going. Unfortunately we had an album to finish other songs to record. The Santa suit was returned, and I went back to managing sessions, booking talent and recording music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To answer the question you are about to ask - no, I don&#39;t believe Michael ever finished his Christmas song. But... you never know for sure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Caryn Elefante, singer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://elefantemusic.blogspot.com/2009/07/personal-story-about-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Elefante Music&rdquo; blog (July 9, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705214026/http://elefantemusic.blogspot.com/2009/07/personal-story-about-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A week or two later my mother got another call from our contractor. This time she said Michael wanted to have us back to the studio to record a Christmas song. It was July but when we got to the studio, it was decorated for the holidays. There was snow all over the ground, a tree, Santa who gave us all presents (we each got a Gameboy... tells you how long ago this was!!) and reindeer. Michael came walking right into the studio this time and didn&#39;t hide behind the glass. I guess he felt more comfortable with us this time [See March 29, 1995 . He taught us the song himself and stayed with us in the sound booth as we were singing it. After we recorded the song he invited our parents into the studio and had the whole thing catered. We sat around the piano as he played the piano and we all sang Christmas songs. It&#39;s just like Christmas Eve at the Elefante&#39;s (my in-laws)!!!</span></p></body>
