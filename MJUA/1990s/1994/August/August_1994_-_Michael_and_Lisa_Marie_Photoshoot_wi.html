I really did not know what awaited me when I arrived, but what I saw made me think of the scene which two in love act as if they were alone in the world, in spite of the crowd which surrounds them. That only comes when two people are deeply enthusiastic about one another. Like everyone, I had heard rumors which surrounded their marriage several weeks ago. But it was necessary that I see them with my own eyes to work out the depth and sincerity of their love. This love, neither could hide from me. It will be enough for you to realize it by lookaw it with ing at my photographs, especially those which I took of Lisa. There are attitudes which cannot be faked. In fact, I did not even need to guide Michael and Lisa. I did not need, for example, to ask them to intertwine. They spontaneously did it and most naturally. I had to only say to them to place themselves at such or such a place, and the rest came naturally. They spoke to each other in a very soft tone, the tone of two people very much in love with one another.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s like when you see two people in the street who&#39;re in love and act like there is no one else around them. I saw it with my own eyes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If you look at the photographs, you&#39;ll notice that there is something going on, especially with Lisa. I didn&#39;t have to tell them to put their arms around each other, they just did it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Having spent an entire day with them, I saw some magical things. They talked to each other very quietly like lovers would. For the first shot, I told them to stand close. They immediately put their arms around each other and Lisa cuddled right up to Michael. I told Lisa to sit in a chair and Michael to kneel beside her. He put his arm around her and pulled her head to his chest, while Lisa tenderly took hold of his hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Between shots, they were whispering and giggling to each other. They were so happy it was hard to keep their attention on the camera. They were so much into each other.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They are so happy with the photos. Michael put Xs over the ones he liked, and the pages of photos were covered with Xs. But the loving ones with Lisa, showing their happiness, were his favorites.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1110/12/ddhln.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Dr. Drew On Call&rdquo; (October 12, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120808151253/http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1110/12/ddhln.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Drew Pinsky: Dick Zimmerman is a world-renowned celebrity photographer and artist. He shot some of Michael Jackson`s most remembered photos and created this portrait of Michael and Lisa Marie for their wedding. His 1982 cover for Michael`s &quot;Thriller&quot; album is iconic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dick Zimmerman joins us tonight. Dick, after you took the wedding portraits, you went, I guess, to Lisa Marie and Michael`s suite. What did you see there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dick Zimmerman: Well, it was a funny story. You know, I got there really late. Oh, it was about midnight. And, the maid let me in. And I hung around. It was kind of dark in there. And I asked when Michael was coming down. And I waited. It was a good half hour, and no Michael. So, I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s going on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I noticed there was a fellow standing next to a pole not too far away. And, I went over just to see, I thought maybe he was a bodyguard or something. And I said do you have any idea -- and I went closer and closer. I said, do you have any idea when Michael is coming down? You know, it was late. And, all of a sudden, I get closer and he starts laughing, and it`s Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was wearing a mustache and a beard. So you know, very playful. Very surprising. We laughed. It was really fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pinsky: Did you eventually sort of develop a friendship with him after working with him for a while?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Zimmerman: I did. Well, that particular night was a very, very good night. We spent quite a bit of time, you know, having -- he opened up a bottle of wine, and he -- you know, we just talked. We talked about life. We went over the photographs that I created for him and Lisa. And he basically -- I got to know him more than ever that evening because he actually had tears in his eyes and he had just finished an interview with Diane Sawyer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t remember. It was &quot;60 Minutes&quot; or something, and he took him around Neverland. and he said, I poured my heart out and I told the truth. I told them everything about me, and they twisted it around, you know? And he says, I don&#39;t know what to do anymore, you know? I can&#39;t -- I tell the truth, and it doesn&#39;t work, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">David Nordahl, &ldquo;Camelot&rdquo; painting description (June 27, 2010) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101202144912/http://www.michaeljacksonart.com/details.php?image_id=2203"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In November, 1994, I spent 2 weeks with Michael and Lisa Marie at the Trump Towers in New York. I was there to work on 2 projects for Michael while he was in the recording studio. Michael and Lisa Marie were great together and a lot of fun to be with.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1995 Michael asked me to do a painting of the 2 of them. Not one to do a normal portrait, he came up with a creative vision of how he wanted to portray their love for each other. Michael gave me a list of things he would like to see in the painting. I made a sketch and sent the original to him. He called me when he received it. He said he loved it and not to change a thing except to make the castle more &quot;fanciful&quot;. At this time, I was working on 3 or 4 projects for Michael. I asked if I should set aside these projects in favor of this painting. Michael told me to finish what I was working on and to do the painting afterwards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sadly, by the time I got around to this painting, Michael and Lisa Marie had separated.</span></p></body>
