Half of the bars were delivered last week, while the other half will be shipped today by express mail&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the Jackson-Presley order, the Sherman Oaks native turned to the tabloid media to cash in on the celebrity sweets. The National Enquirer was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the story, Sheftel said, but it wanted exclusive rights for three weeks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So he went to the television program &quot;Hard Copy,&quot; which broadcast his story Friday, demanding only that he not talk to other TV reporters. He says he was paid &quot;thousands of dollars&quot; by the program--he will not say how much--but the show&#39;s producers will not confirm that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sheftel makes no apologies for his decision to go public.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s a fun story,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m showing a picture of them on their honeymoon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is a sweet story, no pun intended,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lisa Marie Presley, full statement, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3sEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=%22My+marriage+to+Michael+Jackson+took+place+in+a+private+ceremony+outside+the+United+States+11+weeks+ago%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2caJdoh2_y&amp;sig=Ai_49pjw7XPZbJtIWXmDVwjHGQM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjx8sTBkMPfAhVPuVkKHXALAXAQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22My%20marriage%20to%20Michael%20Jackson%20took%20place%20in%20a%20private%20ceremony%20outside%20the%20United%20States%2011%20weeks%20ago%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Jet&rdquo; magazine (August 15, 1994)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My married name is Mrs. Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson.
