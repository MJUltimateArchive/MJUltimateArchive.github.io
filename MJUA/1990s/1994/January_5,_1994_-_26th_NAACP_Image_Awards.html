Thank you for your warm and generous support. I love you very much. Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For decades, the NAACP has stood at the forefront of the struggle for equal justice under the law for all people in our land. They have fought in the lunchrooms of the South, in the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court and in the board rooms of Corporate America, for justice, equality and the very dignity of all mankind. Members of the NAACP have been jailed and even killed in noble pursuit of those ideals, upon which our country was founded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">None of these goals is more meaningful to me at this time in my life, than the notion that everyone is presumed to be innocent... [ovation] Everyone is presumed to be innocent and TOTALLY innocent, until they are charged with a crime and then convicted by a jury of their peers. I never... I never really took the time to understand the importance of that ideal until now, until I became the victim of false allegations, and the willingness of others to believe and exploit the worst before they have had the chance to hear the truth. Because... [people in the audience shout] Thank you. Oh, I love you. [people in the audience shout: &quot;We love you, Michael!&quot;] I love you more!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Because not only am I presumed to be innocent, I AM innocent. And I know the truth will be my salvation. I have been strengthened in my fight to prove my innocence by my faith in God and by the knowledge that I am not fighting this battle alone. Together, we will see this thing through.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m very proud to be here.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And now it is my distinct honour to announce the recipient of the first NAACP Image Award for outstanding choreography in film or television. The Image Award goes to... [people in the audience shout: &quot;Debbie!&quot;] You&#39;re right, Debbie Allen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael presents her with the award]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie Allen: Thank you.
