We both love that movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just walked over to her, reached into my pocket, and pulled out a huge diamond ring.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;&#39;So, what do you think?&#39;, I asked her. &#39;You want?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She squealed out, &#39;Yes, yes yes&#39;. I never even officially popped the question.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We never actually discussed marriage. It just sort of happened.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sham</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of Michael&#39;s most trusted aides confirms: &quot;They had only made love twice, at least to my knowledge, when Michael proposed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The story Michael is now telling is an old-fashioned love story. But the couple&#39;s joy is mixed with sorrow and anger directed at critics who have branded the marriage a sham.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is not a hoax&quot;, Michael insists. &quot;I swear it&#39;s not.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I want people to know that I wouldn&#39;t marry someone just for publicity. That&#39;s just not me. I love her. This is serious. I hope people believe it. If not, then, hey, too bad for them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The other rumors surrounding their marriage he also dismisses, including the constant stories that Lisa is already pregnant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, that&#39;s not true at all&quot;, he sighs. &quot;Lisa Marie is not pregnant.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But he admits: &quot;Yes, we want to have children. Yes, we WILL have children.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then he giggles: &quot;Don&#39;t rush me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another report he is eager to quash is that he asked Lisa Marie to have her breasts enlarged and thighs liposuctioned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He snorts: &quot;Ridiculous. Just try telling Lisa Marie what to do. It would never happen. I would never be able to convince her to do anything she didn&#39;t really want to do, let alone plastic surgery.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The notion that he married Lisa to get his hands on Elvis&#39; fortune is also dismissed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His 350 million dollar wealth is by far greater than Lisa will inherit, even if she eventually takes over control of her father&#39;s estate from her mum, Priscilla.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he has NOT asked her to sign a prenuptial agreement to safeguard his own fortune.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Happy</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I would never ask Lisa Marie to sign a prenuptial agreement&quot;, he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What kind of marriage would that be? No one marries anyone for money. This is love. I swear it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love Lisa Marie. Why won&#39;t people believe that? Why won&#39;t the public let me be happy?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One associate of Jackson&#39;s bluntly labels the lack of a prenuptial agreement &quot;a big mistake.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Article cut off] Michael wants to do. And he didn&#39;t want a prenuptial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He says he loves her, and he feels they&#39;ll be together forever.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although it is being called the weirdest match in Hollywood, Michael claims it was their similar tastes that drew them together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Screwball</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They love watching slapstick, screwball comedy films, like the Three Stooges, and old movies, particularly ones starring Jackson&#39;s great pal Liz Taylor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They also share a love of animals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One of the things that most attracted to me to Lisa is that she gets along well with the many animals in my zoo&quot;, he says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Elizabeth Taylor, for instance, is scared to death of all the animals, especially the horses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But Lisa Marie just loves them. It&#39;s hard not to fall in love with a person who can relate to animals.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The couple first met in 1973, when Michael was a 15-year-old still singing with his brothers in The Jackson Five.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was at the Sahara Tahoe in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, to see Elvis perform.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cute</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We had just signed with Motown. Motown sent us down there to see The King, to get some tips. And Lisa Marie was backstage. She was a cute little kid&quot;, he recalls.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two became friends and stayed in touch over the years, but romance never occurred to either.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, in late December 1993... Michael, 36, decided he wanted to record an Elvis Presley song for his upcoming &quot;HIStory&quot; album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He contacted Lisa Marie, 25, about the possibility and they started seeing each other regularly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of his closest advisers says: &quot;Michael was living full-time at Neverland Ranch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And, all of a sudden, here comes Lisa Marie on the stairs in a bathrobe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We thought, &#39;Well, hey, what&#39;s up here? She spent the night up there? With Michael?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And then here comes Michael down the stairs in his Mickey Mouse pajamas with a big grin on his face.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Orders</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The two were lovey-dovey at breakfast and she hasn&#39;t left his side since then. That was in January 1994.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to staff at Neverland, they knew things were serious when Lisa Marie began dishing out orders to servants.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael started talking about his &#39;girlfriend&#39;, Lisa Marie. And she was around all the time&quot;, said one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No woman has ever given orders to Michael&#39;s servants, except for Elizabeth Taylor--and even she checks with Michael first before she asks for a diet Coke.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although the couple were spotted once at Disneyland together, they were astonished not to be rumbled earlier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lisa Marie was actually present in Las Vegas in February 1994, when Michael taped the &quot;Jackson Family Honors&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She wore a disguise--and not one reporter spotted her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the &quot;Jackson Family Honors&quot;, Lisa Marie spent a weekend with Michael at tycoon Donald Trump&#39;s estate, Mar-A-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida, where they really started to hit it off.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Their secret wedding in the Dominican Republic in May took place after Scientologist Lisa Marie took advantage of the country&#39;s 24-hour divorce law to end her seven-year-marriage to Danny Keough.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The claims of lawyer Hugo Alvarez Perez, who married the couple at home in his living room, were initially treated with scorn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But then Lisa Marie confirmed the marriage though her publicists.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is astonished at the public scorn the announcement attracted.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When he was told one of the reasons was because Lisa Marie&#39;s press release only discussed HER feelings for him, he was perplexed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Duet</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Why should I have to explain how I feel about my wife in a press release?&quot;, he asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The press release was Lisa Marie&#39;s idea. She wanted to set the record straight. If it was up to me, I would have just said, &#39;Let people think what they want.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A final rumor Michael dismissed was the report that he and Lisa Marie will sing a duet on October 8 at a Tribute to Elvis Presley in Memphis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But he adds: &quot;We&#39;ll be together forever, so there&#39;s plenty of time to sing together.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/474091172/"><span class="cs8567212B">New York &ldquo;Daily News&rdquo; (September 12, 1994)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190102193928/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/474091172/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is love,&quot; he tells his biographer Randy Taraborrelli in an interview published today in the London Daily Mirror. &quot;I swear it.
