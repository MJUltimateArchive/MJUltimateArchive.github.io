		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Smile&quot; Single Cover Photoshoot</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date range assessed by the fact that &ldquo;In December, Sony planned to release a double A-side single comprising &lsquo;Smile&rsquo; and &lsquo;Is It Scary&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mike Smallcombe, &ldquo;Making Michael&rdquo;) and Steven said it occurred &ldquo;late in 1994&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Steven Whitsitt, photographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.spwhitsittphoto.com/michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">personal website</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In late in 1994, I had been flying from LA to NY regularly to do photo shoots with Michael at Sony Music studios. Sometimes I would fly out on Thursday and stay until Monday or Tuesday, with the shoot day being on Saturday or Sunday. Once in awhile I would stay over the whole week and shoot two weekends in a row.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One late afternoon I was in my hotel and the phone rang, &ldquo;Please hold for Michael&rdquo; &nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; His voice came on the line, &ldquo; Steve can you come over to the apartment, I want to talk to you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sure Mike, I&rsquo;ll be there in a half hour.&rdquo; &nbsp;I walked the few blocks to Trump Tower where Michael was staying during the recording of the HIStory project. When I got to Michael&rsquo;s floor, his chef let me in and promptly said goodbye leaving Michael &amp; I alone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a few minutes of chatting Michael got down to business:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Steve, do you know the song Smile?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I think so Michael, but I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip;..&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ll just sing it for you&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To put my reaction in context, one has to realize that I was born and raised in a small city &nbsp;just north of Detroit, MI. I had never expected to go very far or do very much in my life, Though I had worked as an assistant for Michael&rsquo;s personal photographer for 3 years, my rise to the position that I was now in was head-spinning fast. I&rsquo;d had conversations with Michael, and was reasonably comfortable with the day to day working relationship, but here I was a kid from Port Huron, MI. and this man was singing a song for an audience of one. Me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It wasn&rsquo;t just the fact that he was singing for me, it was the absolute stunning clarity of his a cappella voice. The hair on my arms stood, I was moved almost to tears. The whole thing lasted only a couple of minutes, when he had finished, Michael asked if I knew anything about the history of the song. I took a couple of seconds to catch my breath, and mumbled some sort of response.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the next few hours Michael educated me on Charlie Chaplin, and specifically his film &ldquo;The Kid&rdquo; and about Jackie Coogan the child actor who played opposite Chaplin in the film, and how Jackie&rsquo;s experiences led to all of the laws that now exist protecting child performers. Michael was a wealth of information. We discussed how we wanted to approach shooting a single cover for the song, and settled on a couple of concepts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next several weeks were a blur of interviewing set builders, casting, and covering all of the details necessary to pull the shoot together. Michael didn&rsquo;t need to tell me that he expected perfection out of this shoot. He inspired it in me in when he sang the song. We were both pleased with the results.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-dec-09-la-et-jackson-opus9-2009dec09-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (December 9, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200309203847/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-dec-09-la-et-jackson-opus9-2009dec09-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The black-and-white photos of Michael Jackson are remarkable not only as previously unreleased images of one the last half-century&rsquo;s most photographed men. They also reveal much about the pop superstar&rsquo;s abiding impulses: his impish sense of humor, his fealty to yesteryear&rsquo;s master showmen and his concern about his own place in the pop culture firmament.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sporting a threadbare black suit, pancake makeup and a miniature brush mustache, Jackson is a doppelg&auml;nger for Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Tramp&rdquo; character from 1921&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Kid.&rdquo; The photos, taken in 1994 by Steve Whitsitt, were originally intended as a companion piece to the Chaplin-inspired video the director-photographer was shooting for &ldquo;Smile&rdquo; -- the cover of the silent comedian&rsquo;s famous song that appears on Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;HIStory&rdquo; album. But when the Chaplin estate issued a cease-and-desist order to stifle &ldquo;Smile&rsquo;s&rdquo; release as a video and single, Whitsitt abandoned the photos to his archives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Until earlier this year, that is, when the photographer received a surprise phone call from photo editor Deborah Wald, who was working on a new Jackson omnibus. &ldquo;I asked him if he had something special, something of Michael that hadn&rsquo;t previously seen the light of day,&rdquo; Wald said. &ldquo;And he said, &lsquo;I think I have something.&rsquo; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whitsitt&rsquo;s seven photos, as well as some 300 other images of and for the King of Pop that have never before been seen publicly, provide the backbone for &ldquo;The Official Michael Jackson Opus&rdquo;: a lushly produced coffee-table book that came out Monday.</span></p></body>
