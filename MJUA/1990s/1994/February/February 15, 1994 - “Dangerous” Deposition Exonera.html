He said no one helped him write it, and he denied ever hearing Cartier&#39;s song before she filed her lawsuit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Jan. 12, a Los Angeles jury found in Jackson&#39;s favor in a similar lawsuit involving his hits &quot;Thriller,&quot; &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; and &quot;We Are the World.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cartier was not present when the verdict was read. She left the courtroom in tears earlier Tuesday during the closing argument of Jackson&#39;s attorney, Dan Hoffman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cartier&#39;s testimony contained discrepancies and revealed &quot;a fundamental reality that simply doesn&#39;t exist,&quot; Hoffman said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/02/15/Jackson-wins-Dangerous-copyright-lawsuit/2334761288400/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;UPI&rdquo; (February 15, 1994)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web20190714182319/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/02/15/Jackson-wins-Dangerous-copyright-lawsuit/2334761288400/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A federal court jury decided Tuesday that pop star Michael Jackson did not steal the idea for his hit song from a Denver woman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The eight-person jury deliberated less than four hours before reaching a unanimous verdict in the copyright infringement suit in which the woman claimed Jackson stole the idea for &#39;Dangerous&#39; from a demo tape she sent him in 1990.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;We were quite delighted with the outcome and feel that justice was served today,&#39; Jackson&#39;s attorney Eve Wagner said outside court after the six-day trial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was not in court for the verdict, but testified Monday that he did not steal the song. He said he was inspired to write it while listening to the bass track to another of his own songs, &#39;Street Walker,&#39; and said he never listens to unsolicited demo tapes like the one Crystal Cartier sent to him because the prospect of such lawsuits makes it &#39;dangerous.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cartier claimed Jackson&#39;s hit evolved from a demo tape she had copyrighted and sent to Jackson. But the tape she produced as evidence dated to October 1990, after Jackson recorded a demo version of his own song that was released in 1992.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Therefore copying was physically impossible,&#39; Wagner said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The defense portrayed Cartier as an obsessed Jackson fan, pointing to a fantasy novel she wrote, &#39;Immortal Obsessions,&#39; in which the leading lady&#39;s song is copied and a character apparently modeled on Jackson leaps to her defense.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cartier may have hindered her own credibility when she showed up for court on the day Jackson was to testify, wearing what Wagner described as &#39;a very revealing black leather dress.&#39; The judge ordered her to wear a coat for the remainder of the morning and then to go home and change clothes before the afternoon session of the trial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cartier has made one record, &#39;Love Story Act I,&#39; which sold fewer than two dozen copies at local record outlets, Wagner said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was Jackson&#39;s second copyright lawsuit this year. Last month a Los Angeles federal jury also voted unanimously in his favor, finding that he did not steal the music to his hit &#39;We Are The World.&#39; He also prevailed in a 1984 suit involving his album &#39;Thriller.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wagner said Jackson, as a successful singer-songwriter, frequently is threatened with legal actions like these but no other cases have gone to trial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://variety.com/1994/biz/news/jackson-wins-copyright-case-118353/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Variety&rdquo; (February 15, 1994)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916174541/https://variety.com/1994/biz/news/jackson-wins-copyright-case-118353/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A Denver Federal court jury ruled Tuesday that pop star<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://variety.com/t/michael-jackson/"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://variety.com/t/michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">Michael Jackson</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> did not steal the hit song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; from a local songwriter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The four-man, four-woman U.S. District Court jury deliberated for less than three hours before reaching its verdict in the five-day copyright infringement case brought by aspiring recording artist Crystal Cartier.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s three out of three,&rdquo; said Los Angeles lawyer Eve Wagner, who along with Dan Hoffman represented Jackson during the trial. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad justice has been done,&rdquo; she said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has been exonerated in two previous copyright infringement cases, including last month&rsquo;s ruling by a Los Angeles District court jury that Jackson did not steal the hit songs &ldquo;We Are the World,&rdquo;Thriller&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Girl Is Mine&rdquo; from three childhood acquaintances. The singer won a copyright action in 1983 brought by a Chicago songwriter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hoffman&rsquo;s blistering summation during closing arguments caused Cartier to flee the courtroom in tears, when he told jurors that her testimony was fraught with discrepancies. Cartier did not return to the court to hear the verdict.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You would have to conclude that right down the line every (defense) witness came to lie under oath,&rdquo; Hoffman said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way you can believe Miss Cartier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Monday, Jackson testified he wrote the music and lyrics to &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; and demonstrated his songwriting technique to the court.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gretchen Eberhardt, one of Cartier&rsquo;s attorneys, said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the verdict.</span></p></body>
