I wrote the song for the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; album called &ldquo;Streetwalker&rdquo; and it had driving bass melody, strong driving bass lick. [cough] Sorry. That bass lick was taken by my engineer , cause I was kinda frustrated with this song in general. So he took the bass and put new chords to the bass melody, which is what inspired the song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You say the bass lick and would you tell all of us who don&rsquo;t know what lick is, what this term means in your field?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, a bass lick is a melody of what the bass guitar or the bass moog, which is an instrument called a moog or synthesizer performs. And it could be the melody of the song. And that&rsquo;s what that is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Could you describe for us Mr. Jackson the process and sequence of events which you use in composing songs generally and then we&rsquo;ll get to &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; specifically. Is there a kind of process you go through?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, usually when I write the songs I get I&hellip; I vocally, I orally use a melody into a tape recorder. And for instance with the song &ldquo;Streetwalker&rdquo; which has a driving bass lick that I just spoke about, which I&rsquo;ll have a tape recorder and I&rsquo;d just sing the bass part into that tape recorder. And for &ldquo;Streetwalker&rdquo; the bass melody went a [sings] And I&rsquo;ve taped that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick. And I&hellip; And that what inspires the melody or the other sounds that I&rsquo;m hearing in my head, but that is the bass lick and I use the moog and a bass guitar to create that sound that I&rsquo;m hearing in my head.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Mr. Jackson, by the way who is the engineer that took &ldquo;Streetwalker&rdquo; stripped it down to the bass, the bass lick.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Billy Bottrell.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What happens&hellip; You say you hear things, the song, the melody you hear in your head?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah. You mean the melody, the vocal melody?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We&rsquo;ll get to &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; in a minute, use some other song if you would, any of the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Okay. For instance, when creating the song &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; I was writing in my car, it started with bass lick again, which goes&hellip; [beatboxing] And on top of it I&rsquo;ll hear the chords [sings] then the melody [sings]. And the lyrics, the strings, the chorus everything comes at that moment, like a gift that is put right into your hand. And that&rsquo;s how I hear it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You just start sing lyrics?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Absolutely. When I said &ldquo;Billie Jean is not my lover&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t think about it, it just came and I&rsquo;ll dropped in my laps at once. And I loved it so I&rsquo;ve, I drove fast home and I got on the microphone and put things down. Then I went to the studio, got the musicians and gave them all their parts. That&rsquo;s how, I mean that&rsquo;s how that was created. Same things you know, with other songs that I&rsquo;ve created.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> By the way, do you read music?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who wrote the lyrics to your song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I wrote the lyrics to &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did anyone, anyone in the world assist you in writing the lyrics to &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Mr. Jackson, who wrote the vocal melody to &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;, your song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I did it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did anyone in the entire world including Mr. Riley, Mr. Bottrell, anyone, assist you in writing the vocal melody?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No one at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who named the song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;?

Let&rsquo;s say Bottrell gave you the tape with the bass lick&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> For that one I&rsquo;d say maybe three weeks. Just listening to it every once in a while and letting the melody create itself and hearing the chords and the bass lick you know. And not dictating how it should be, just letting kinda form itself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">=====</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://youtu.be/cjsFb06euvI"><span class="cs8567212B">Part 2</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><a href="http://youtu.be/cjsFb06euvI"></a><span class="csD5D7D290">=====</span><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you ever in your life hear about person named Crystal Cartier before this lawsuit was filed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you ever hear a song written by Miss. Cartier called &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; before this lawsuit was filed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Never in my life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;re positive?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&rsquo;m more than positive. It&rsquo;s an honest true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Could you demonstrate for us starting with the Bottrell cassette or tape which the bass were now stripped down, you&rsquo;ve been given what that bass would sound like, and just go through and name the process of creating the song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo;. Just take it step by step, just tell us what you do as you go along.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Starting with the bass at &ldquo;Streetwalker&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Okay, like I said before, I wrote the song &ldquo;Streetwalker&rdquo; and I wasn&rsquo;t completely satisfied with it, I was frustrated that&rsquo;s you know, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly what it should be. I have a lot of songs like that like kinda unfinished. And I&hellip; So I gave the song to Billy and he fooled around with it, he put some drum sounds and put it through you know computers and things. And he gave the tape back to me with the bass lick, the drums and everything on it. And I&rsquo;d listen to it quite often and I liked what I&rsquo;ve heard but it didn&rsquo;t really have a melody yet, a vocal melody. And eventually the melody just came, just hearing the music the whole composition as itself. And the first, the first part I knew I wanted to talk the verses like a rap: </span><span class="cs43C038A">As she walked into the room I knew right then and there was something different about this girl. The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines, divinity in motion </span><span class="csD5D7D290">So that&rsquo;s pretty much the verse, then it goes into the B-section, which leads up to the chorus and it goes the chorus: </span><span class="cs43C038A">I never knew but I was walking the line Come go with me, I said I have no time</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Then it goes, it builds to from the B-section to the chorus the lyrics were </span><span class="cs43C038A">we didn&#39;t talk on the phone. My baby cried and left me standing alone. She&#39;s so dangerous, the girl is dangerous </span><span class="csD5D7D290">And that&rsquo;s pretty much how it happened, just hearing those chords that inspired the melody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What part of that you&rsquo;ve done if you&rsquo;ve done is the vocal melody?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That was the B-section leading into the chorus.

And that what inspired the melody, what he did is what inspired me to write the melody, cause out of that whenever I hear the chords you need to have that [port] progression, I hear a million melodies in my head and hearing that that&rsquo;s what inspired me to write that, what Billy did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">L:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What was Mr. Riley, Teddy Riley&rsquo;s contribution?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Teddy&rsquo;s contribution, cause even after recording the one you&rsquo;ve just heard I still wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with it, to me it wasn&rsquo;t contemporary enough, so I had Teddy going and kinda update the sounds and give them more of the hate using the word hip-hop, but it had a hip-hop kind of modern feel, where you could do all of new dances to, cause I love to dance. And when I played the song at home and danced to it the one you heard, it didn&rsquo;t move me enough, so I wanted to do it more fire, more action and more depth and that&rsquo;s what he contributed to the song. Changing the sound of things, the sound of the bass, the quality of the bass, the sound of the drums and he gave us the driving [** beat], that has more anger and the snare, more feeling and emotion, which I was looking for originally.
