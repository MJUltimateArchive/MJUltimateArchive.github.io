They have been to both Disney World and the Sea World in Florida and spent a lot of time together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She didn&#39;t tell her mum, Priscilla, or any of us that she was marrying.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">True</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When Priscilla questioned her about it on the telephone, she told her mother it was true, then hung up.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She knows that marrying Jackson is a triumph for the Scientologists. He no doubt will be handing over masses of money.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He is said to be worth at least &pound;400 million. She inherited &pound;100 million from her father&#39;s estate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lisa Marie has introduced Jackson to the religious cult and he has been attending services.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The secrecy surrounding the organization appealed to his reclusive nature at a time when his popularity had dipped to an all-time low. Jackson chose the Latin American equivalent of Las Vegas for his cheap, no frills wedding.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The nuptials were held up for 11 days when terrified Michael barricaded himself and Lisa Marie in their hotel suites, after local people took to the streets to protest about alleged vote rigging in presidential elections.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the security-conscious star&#39;s request for the ceremony to be held on a plane in Dominican Republic airspace was refused, he insisted it take place at the home of Judge Hugo Alvarez Perez on May 26.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Vows</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was dressed all in black including a fedora, which he politely removed to take his vows. His bride wore a beige minidress.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Senor Perez&#39;s wife translated the ceremony, which was conducted in Spanish.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But their children were ushered away by bodyguards who also searched the house for hidden cameras and video recorders.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The couple exchanged rings, but there was no kiss from Jackson for his bride.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was very shy about saying the words, but when it came to the &quot;I do&quot; part, he said it casually, like &#39;Yeah, why not&#39;&quot;, said the judge.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Jackson could now be in trouble with the Los Angeles district attorney who may want to know why he broke an agreement not to leave the US.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His passport was being held by his own legal team.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We are extremely angry that we were not notified&quot;, said one prosecutor. The singer was so determined to keep the marriage secret, he did not tell his family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Father Joe said last night: &quot;When we heard about this marriage, I thought it was just another stupid story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But I have spoken to Michael&#39;s people and they tell me it&#39;s true. I knew they were seeing a lot of each other. They have been friends for a long time&gt;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She is a lovely girl and very spiritual, like Michael.

Afterwards, he invited me to stay with him in California.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Am American woman named Eve Darling and Thomas Keough--believed to be a relative of Lisa Marie&#39;s former husband Danny--were present as witnesses, he claimed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ceremony</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s bodyguard made a videotape of the ceremony, added Mr. Perez.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The exclusive Dominican Republic resort of Casa de Campo--which has its own airstrip and dock--said Jackson had stayed there in May.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808115820im_/http://0101.nccdn.net/1_5/25d/060/224/1229913887959306.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown newspaper snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Judge Hugo Francisco Alvarez says he conducted the ceremony at his home in La Vega on May 26.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He says Jackson made a secret visit to the island in April and asked to be married on May 18 in an aircraft.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;All the arrangements were made through an American lawyer&quot;, said Alvarez. &quot;I refused to do a ceremony in an aircraft and we then discussed a civil ceremony in the home of a prominent industrialist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Jackson turned it down because he thought details might leak out. Then the date had to be changed to May 26, because of electoral problems and I offered my home and promised total secrecy.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, 35, is said to have paid about &pound;20 for the service, attended by two lawyers, a woman holding a baby, and a man understood to be a bodyguard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Alvarez said: &quot;One of the lawyers did the translating. The ceremony was entirely in Spanish. Jackson was very shy and didn&#39;t have the braids I had seen in pictures. She seemed a bit nervous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Afterwards, he thanked me for the arrangements, and invited me to visit him if I was ever in California.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The witness signatures were said to be those of two Americans, Eve Darling and Thomas Keough.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lisa Marie, sole heiress to the multi-million-dollar Presley estate, separated last year from her Scientologist husband Danny Keough.
