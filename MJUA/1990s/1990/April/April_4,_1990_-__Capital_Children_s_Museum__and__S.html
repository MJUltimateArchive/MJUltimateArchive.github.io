The town went nuts over you, but I guess you know that. A photo op with George Bush yesterday morning in the Rose Garden, a meeting with Dan Quayle in his office, a fund-raising buffet in your honor last night (at up to $5,000 a plate!) at the historic Merrywood estate in McLean... . Not too shabby.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But how come you didn&#39;t let anybody know you were coming, you sneak? Hey, I know you&#39;re MICHAEL JACKSON and everything, but have you forgotten how to pick up a phone or what?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Look, you spent about 90 minutes at the Capital Children&#39;s Museum downtown Wednesday morning, and I had to hear about how much fun you had from Ann W. Lewin, executive director of the National Learning Center, which runs the museum. (You never even told me the high-powered Friends of the Capital Children&#39;s Museum teamed up with the White House to declare you &quot;Entertainer of the Decade,&quot; and to laud you for your philanthropic work on behalf of kids, which was the reason for this Washington visit and the big-ticket chow-down. Hey, man, I&#39;m in the book!)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lewin said you played with just about every hands-on exhibit. &quot;He patted our fat old goat, Rosie,&quot; she said. &quot;He spent a full 10 minutes in our animation studio.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were hundreds of kids in the museum when you stopped by. &quot;It was a surprise to all of them,&quot; Lewin said. &quot;In fact, some of the kids didn&#39;t believe it was Michael Jackson. ... Children are confused enough by the media. ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But one little 3-year-old stood up and said, &#39;Hi there, Michael Jackson!&#39; And he smiled and said, &#39;Hi there,&#39; &quot; Lewin said. &quot;Wherever we went, he just gathered the children around him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After that, you went to the Smithsonian&#39;s National Museum of American History, but you could only stay a few minutes because there was such a hubbub. &quot;He saw the Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; said museum spokeswoman Susan Foster. &quot;And it was at that point that our visitors saw him. And then they didn&#39;t see him... . He moved out of the public area.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee Solters, your official spokesman, said the Smithsonian &quot;turned out to be like a concert arena -- the squealing and the yelling ... the Kodak crowd.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/arts/bushes-see-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; (April 5, 1990)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/2017*/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/arts/bushes-see-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;Michael toured the museum for two hours yesterday&#39;&#39; said Ann Lewin, director of the institution, which has been serving children for 10 years. &#39;&#39;He played with everything.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Capital Children&rsquo;s Museum&rdquo; employee, Museum tape (Video 1) description</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson stopped by the MediaArts at Capital Children&#39;s Museum in Washington DC for an official visit (BAD era), and staff captured his time in the U-TV interactive television studio.
