Only the thunk-thunk of the ventilator and the beep-beep of the heart monitor fill the silence. Finally, Elton finds the words for this moment, so different from that concert stage of a year ago. &ldquo;Ryan,&rdquo; he says softly, leaning close to the blank face. &ldquo;Michael Jackson called to see how you were. You can&rsquo;t turn down a superstar like that. I&rsquo;m grade B compared to Michael. Everyone from Los Angeles sends their love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...By midnight, as teams of nurses and doctors scramble in and out of the room, desperate to shield this flickering candle, Dr. Kleiman stands in the hall by himself. Ryan is dying. &ldquo;I feel terrible,&rdquo; he says. About 1 A.M. on Sunday, Jeanne takes a call at Ryan&rsquo;s bedside from longtime family friend Michael Jackson. Michael bought Ryan a red Mustang about a year ago, and the Whites have been frequent guests at his California ranch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael wants to come that minute. He is in Atlantic City.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;How long will it take you, Michael?,&rdquo; she asks. Jeanne looks at a nurse wearing goggles. &ldquo;Two hours?&rdquo; she asks the nurse.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The nurse shakes her head.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael, don&rsquo;t come, honey. Ryan isn&rsquo;t expected to last two hours. We know how much you love him.&rdquo; Jackson says he&rsquo;ll be there in-the morning, and he is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Ann Marie Cunningham, co-author, &ldquo;Ryan White: My Own Story&rdquo; (epilogue)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was no phone in Ryan&#39;s room, but when Michael Jackson called, Elton and Jeanne asked the hospital for a special hook-up. Michael would have two minutes to speak. &ldquo;Ryan&rdquo;, Elton said, &ldquo;you can&#39;t turn down a superstar like this. I&#39;m grade B compared to Michael.&rdquo; He held the phone to Ryan&#39;s ear so Michael could encourage him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...As soon as Michael Jackson arrived, he went straight to the Whites&#39; home in Cicero. He was very upset that he hadn&#39;t gotten there before Ryan died. He went up to Ryan&#39;s room, which was full of his collections, posters, and souvenirs, including his director&#39;s chair from the movie set. In it sat a giant toy gorilla that Ryan hat spotted in New Orleans and that the National Education Association sent him. On the walls were Alyssa Milano&#39;s friendship bracelet, Max Headroom posters, and the hearts needlepointed by Kris, Ryan&#39;s old girlfriend in Kokomo. Hanging from the ceiling was a real parachute, a present from Aunt Janet, and a thousand paper cranes - Japanese symbols of long life that an Indiana school had folded for Ryan from coloured papers. In the closet was the heavy new leather jacket Michael had wanted him to wear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, a fellow G. I. Joe collector, sat quietly looking at everything for a long time. He told Jeanne he felt close to Ryan in his room. Jeanne offered him anything he liked there as a keepsake, but he asked her to leave Ryan&#39;s room just as it was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the Whites&#39; front yard sat the red Mustang Michael had given Ryan. Now it was covered with flowers and Easter eggs, gifts from children. Andrea took Michael out to show him the car and they sat in together. When Michael turned on the CD player, Ryan&#39;s favourite song, Michael&#39;s &ldquo;Man In The Mirror&rdquo;, began to play. Michael smiled proudly. He knew it must have been the last song Ryan had played.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jeanne told Michael she had recorded a phone conversation he&#39;d had with Ryan. She was afraid Michael might be offended, but he said he wished she&#39;d recorded all their talks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://life.spectator.co.uk/2016/09/the-donald-jacko-and-me/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Spectator Life&rdquo; (September 22, 2016)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next morning in my room at the Taj, my hotel phone rang.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;Good morning Alex,&rsquo; said Trump. He was good at names, good at fixing the individual with the laser beam that top politicians and celebrities deploy. &lsquo;Like to come on a trip with me and Michael today?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If an important part of the president&rsquo;s job is soaking up attention, of being the focus point in America&rsquo;s moronic inferno (as Martin Amis put it), then Trump&rsquo;s had plenty of practice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We were travelling on a private jet &mdash; a prototypical Hair Force One, though to be fair it wasn&rsquo;t Trump&rsquo;s &mdash; and I was seated across from the two headliners at a table for four. A nervous flier, I wondered whether being on a jet with Donald Trump and Michael Jackson made a crash more or less statistically probable. Would the pilots be dazzled by the celebrity wattage? Headlines flashed into my thoughts: &lsquo;Jacko and Trump in Private Jet Horror&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was a nervous presence, taller than you&rsquo;d think, with a finely shaped nose and visible makeup. If he had scars, you couldn&rsquo;t see them. He spoke very little and in that weird, high-pitched whisper which would not have felt out of place in a </span><span class="cs43C038A">Star Trek </span><span class="csD5D7D290">movie. I couldn&rsquo;t make out what he was saying and thought it would be impertinent to ask him to repeat himself. So I nodded along, grinning enthusiastically. I&rsquo;d be surprised if Trump could make head or tail of it either, but he was polite and good-humoured about it. All casino owners have a good poker face.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael pulled out a copy of the </span><span class="cs43C038A">National Enquirer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, then as now the gold standard when it came to scandalous celebrity tittle-tattle. The </span><span class="cs43C038A">Enquirer</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rsquo;s front-page headline was often about Jackson. But this time it was some nonsense about Donald Trump.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At this point I remembered my course in photojournalism. A picture of Michael Jackson reading the </span><span class="cs43C038A">National Enquirer, </span><span class="csD5D7D290">with a cover story about Donald Trump, who happened to be sitting next to him on a private jet, would have been a media studies classic. I had a camera on the table, but for some reason I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to pick it up. Like Madame Bovary, I wanted to feel like one of the aristocrats at the ball, rather than a peasant with his nose pressed up against the glass. Or maybe it was just cowardice. These celebrity demi-gods are capricious. Access so casually granted can just as casually be withdrawn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After landing in Indianapolis &mdash; our motorcade rebooted &mdash; we finally discovered where it was we were supposed to be going. As it turned out, the reason we were there was that Michael Jackson wanted to visit a sick child and his minder knew where he lived. I stayed by the car. The engagement over, we careered back to the airport, back up into the sky and back to New Jersey. And as the sun set on our fun day out, Trump wrote a polite thank-you note to the guy who had loaned Jacko the jet &mdash; Akio Morita, co-founder of Sony. (Yes, Trump writes thank-you notes, at least to fellow business swashbucklers.) Trump and I then settled into the back seat of another limo for a ride back to New York.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-15/news/vw-550_1_ryan-white"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (July 15, 1990)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ryan&#39;s suitcase--still unpacked from that last trip to California--sits on his bed at home in Cicero. His room is as it was, with autographed posters of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jackson and Elton John; his monkey collection, and his director&#39;s chair from the set of the ABC-TV movie, &quot;The Ryan White Story.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I went through all his drawers,&quot; Jeanne says, &quot;hoping to find that extra little note, you know.&quot; But there was none.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She doesn&#39;t think he believed he really was going to die.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She remembers that the day Ryan died, Jackson, who flew in that afternoon with Donald Trump, kept excusing himself to go up to Ryan&#39;s room at the White home. &quot;The last time he stayed about an hour,&quot; she recalls. &quot;Michael asked me to keep the room the same.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson had given Ryan a customized red Mustang. Jeanne says: &quot;We&#39;ve thought about donating it to a children&#39;s museum. It&#39;s so unique, I mean, Michael got the fanciest stereo system, it&#39;s just super-deluxe for a Mustang.&quot;</span></p></body>
