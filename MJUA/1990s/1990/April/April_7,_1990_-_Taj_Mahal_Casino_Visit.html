One host, Brian Reich, acknowledged that some guests were livid. But he said the chaos did not compare with that trailing the singer Michael Jackson as he strolled through a hall of the casino on Saturday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;When he walked through here, people just went crazy,&#39;&#39; Mr. Reich said. &#39;&#39;Ladies were getting trampled, kids were getting trampled. Somebody lost a shoe, and they thought it was Michael Jackson&#39;s shoe. They were going for his shoe.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://life.spectator.co.uk/2016/09/the-donald-jacko-and-me/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Spectator Life&rdquo; (September 22, 2016)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson in 1990 was at the very pinnacle of his fame&hellip; Whether he was paid to come or turned up for free, I didn&rsquo;t discover, but his unannounced appearance caused a whirling sandstorm at the Taj Mahal. If Queen Cleopatra herself had risen from the dead and checked in using a solid gold Amex card there could have been no more excitement in reception than that which greeted Jacko&rsquo;s arrival.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Only one man could control the situation: stepforward The Donald.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Taking Michael by the arm, Trump steered him through the pandemonium on the ground floor. A comprehensive tour took in reception, a crowded escalator (I&rsquo;ve no idea where it went), the football-field-sized gaming floor and the 24-hour slots. The TV news guys rolled along euphorically to document the chaos, not quite believing their luck. At one point, if memory serves, we took refuge in a Chinese restaurant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trump staged an extravagant launch presentation which foreshadowed the circus-like atmosphere of his 2016 presidential rallies. He knew where to put the spotlight. He didn&rsquo;t need a PR team &mdash; if I met one that day, I don&rsquo;t remember it. He was a one-man PR team.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson retired to his suite. I later heard a rumour that he&rsquo;d been spotted disguised as an old woman, playing the slots with a plastic bucket full of quarters.</span></p></body>
