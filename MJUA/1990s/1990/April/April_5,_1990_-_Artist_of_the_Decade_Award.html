The town went nuts over you, but I guess you know that. A photo op with George Bush yesterday morning in the Rose Garden, a meeting with Dan Quayle in his office, a fund-raising buffet in your honor last night (at up to $5,000 a plate!) at the historic Merrywood estate in McLean... . Not too shabby.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But how come you didn&#39;t let anybody know you were coming, you sneak? Hey, I know you&#39;re MICHAEL JACKSON and everything, but have you forgotten how to pick up a phone or what?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...At the White House yesterday morning, I did manage to get a glimpse of you. What a mob scene outside the Oval Office! You came stepping out with President Bush, with your black sunglasses on (now what did I tell you about that?), smiling your shy smile, wearing a black outfit with red stripes all over it. The video people and the still photographers got busy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was no podium, no microphone. Consequently, those in the reporters&#39; section couldn&#39;t hear a word the president said. In fact, one of the reporters said afterward, &quot;Could you hear anything the president said?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This was particularly upsetting to some of the White House beat reporters because the president chose this opportunity to make his first comments about the just-announced summit meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev May 30 through June 3.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But here&#39;s what the Associated Press reported President Bush saying: &quot;I just wanted to welcome Michael Jackson here. And, named artist of the decade, and he has a tremendous following. He does good work—what we call the &#39;points of light&#39; concept. I just wanted to bring him out here and officially welcome him to the White House once again.&quot; (Don&#39;t think I forgot the time you dropped in on Ronald Reagan back in May of &#39;84. You didn&#39;t call then, either.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The president shook your hand, but you didn&#39;t say a thing. Not a word. The whole event lasted all of a minute. (For Reagan, you at least had 17 words.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Your man Solters informed me that before the photo op, Barbara Bush gave you and your entourage a tour of the White House living quarters, including the Lincoln Bedroom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">From there, you went to the Old Executive Office Building to meet with Vice President Quayle. Every office in the place was empty. Employees filled the corridors. Many brought their kids to work to see you! Not Quayle, though. &quot;Being a conscientious parent, he didn&#39;t want to upset their school schedule,&quot; said Joseph Perkins, deputy assistant to the vice president. Can you believe that? If I was Quayle&#39;s son, Pops would have some serious explaining to do!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyway, Perkins said you and Quayle &quot;hit it off famously.&quot; &quot;It also happens that Michael is a native-born Hoosier, and the vice president reminded him of that,&quot; Perkins added.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The vice president &quot;showed Michael the desk used by the last 10 vice presidents. He really liked it,&quot; said Perkins.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did see Quayle bringing you out on the balcony and pointing in the distance. What was that about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And how about that Merrywood place? Did you know Jacqueline Kennedy grew up there? Now it&#39;s owned by developer Alan Kay and his wife, Dianne, who had more than 200 folks over last night for the benefit. Your press conference in the Kays&#39; indoor basketball court was so cute. You came out holding the hand of the Kays&#39; 5-year-old granddaughter Lauren. And when the bashful girl disappeared behind Dianne&#39;s gown, you smiled at the reporters and cameramen and said, &quot;She&#39;s hiding.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Terse as always, you said: &quot;I would like to thank the Kays and the Capital Children&#39;s Museum for their hospitality, and little Lauren for showing me around today. She was so kind. Thank you very much.&quot; And then, after posing for a shot, zoom, outta there. Small talk? Forget about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You did make quite an impression on Alan Kay, though. &quot;My granddaughter loved him,&quot; he said. &quot;He truly responds to children.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To children, you respond. Me, I don&#39;t even get a card at Christmas. Oh well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Until next time,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Your Buddy</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/arts/bushes-see-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; (April 6, 1990)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">White House employees, including secretaries and maintenance men, gathered under the Rose Garden portico, straining their necks and cameras. On Pennsylvania Avenue, curious crowds gathered at the fence awaiting his depclicking arture in a white stretch limousine. A visiting head of state? No, it was the elusive megastar Michael Jackson, come to see the President.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As he stood at Mr. Bush&#39;s side in the Rose Garden this morning to be photographed, the entertainer was dressed in his usual glittering style: a black military-style jacket and leggings trimmed with bands of red, silver buckles and an enormous rhinestone pin. Dark curls fell to his shoulders. His feet were shod in silver-and-black high-topped shoes and he wore black gloves. As he walked from the Oval Office with the President and Barbara Bush, the Bushes&#39; daughter-in-law, Margaret, and Millie, the Bushes&#39; dog, he quickly donned his trademark sunglasses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The celebrated singer, dancer and songwriter visited the White House, a press aide said, to talk about his interest in the President&#39;s &#39;&#39;points of light&#39;&#39; concept. After speaking of Mr. Jackson&#39;s humanitarian work with children, Mr. Bush briefly discussed the coming visit by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which had just been announced.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For his part, Mr. Jackson smiled angelically, shook the President&#39;s hand twice and spoke not one word. There was no moonwalking today. Mr. Jackson was in town to receive a humanitarian award from the Capital Children&#39;s Museum for his work on behalf of children. Tonight he is being honored by the Friends of the Museum at a $1,000-a-person benefit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;Michael toured the museum for two hours yesterday,&#39;&#39; said Ann Lewin, director of the institution, which has been serving children for 10 years. &#39;&#39;He played with everything.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808121305/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dangerous_1990.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown newspaper snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Generating more of a commotion than most foreign heads of state, pop king Michael Jackson paid a courtesy call on President George Bush.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson wore a tight-fitting black drum major&#39;s outfit with a broad red stripe running down the legs to his silver-tipped boots yesterday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Originally, the White House was scheduled to bring in a small group of reporters and photographers to the Oval Office for the traditional photo opportunity with a visiting dignitary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Intense interest forced a switch to the Rose Garden where Bush told Jackson: &quot;You&#39;ve got a few fans over here.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, in a scene from the theatre of the absurd, Bush began talking about his summit with Mikhail Gorbachev as Jackson stared at him with a bemused look.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mark Blackwell, Spin Magazine editor, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-289291"><span class="cs8567212B">CNN iReport (July 1, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was quite a surreal scene. My first glimpse of Jackson came when he briefly appeared in his pseudo-military regalia on a balcony across the street from the White House talking to Vice President Dan Quayle (I would still give anything to have been in on that conversation). Eventually Jackson arrived to face the press in the Rose Garden, escorted by President George Bush and Barbara Bush.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is what we call a photo opportunity,&quot; Bush joked to Jackson, before presenting him to the press.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I just wanted to welcome Michael Jackson here,&quot; Bush announced, nearly drowned out by the sound of a lingering helicopter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He does good work, what we call the &#39;Points of Light&#39; concept. I just wanted to bring him out here and officially welcome him to the White House once again. Glad you&#39;re here, sir. Very pleased you&#39;re here.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson beamed and shook Bush&#39;s hand twice, but never spoke a word.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the rather strange remainder of the press briefing the singer stood at rigid attention, his hands tucked behind his back, as Bush answered a number of questions regarding breaking news of an upcoming summit meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev. There was no Q&amp;A session with Jackson, but later I met him in the White House driveway and shook his gloved hand. As Jackson&#39;s limousine began to pull away I asked him through his half-open window if he had any words for Spin readers, and he leaned out and whispered, &quot;I love you all...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/arts/bushes-see-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;New York Times&rdquo; (April 6, 1990)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">White House employees, including secretaries and maintenance men, gathered under the Rose Garden portico, straining their necks and clicking cameras.
