Jackson&#39;s output in the decade included the era&#39;s two largest-selling albums, &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Thriller.&quot; Tommy Mottolo, president of CBS Records, said, &quot;If I stood here 10 years ago and told you any artist would accomplish what Michael Jackson accomplished, you would probably have laughed me off the stage.&quot; &quot;Thriller&quot; was the first album to generate seven Top 10 singles, including the title cut and &quot;Beat It.&quot;</span></p></body>
