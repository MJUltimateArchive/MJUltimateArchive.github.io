They need not have fretted: The American Cinema Awards, which this year honored &ldquo;lifetime achievers&rdquo; Liz Taylor and Gregory Peck and &ldquo;entertainer of the decade&rdquo; Michael Jackson, drew Clint Eastwood, Whoopi Goldberg, Clayton (The Lone Ranger) Moore, Petula Clark, Sophia Loren, Roddy McDowall and some 1,400 others to the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills for an evening of raising toasts and funds simultaneously. (The $300-to $5,000-a-plate ticket price benefited the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital, a retirement home for entertainers.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The question of what a film-oriented group was doing presenting a major award to Jackson&mdash;who appeared in one movie, The Wiz, 12 years ago&mdash;was left to monks who specialize in that sort of thing. Attendees mingled, munched filet mignon and listened to lavish praise for the honorees. McDowall lauded Liz as a &ldquo;complex and radiant talent&hellip;a creature with not one shred of malice toward anything or anyone.&rdquo; Lauren Bacall called Peck &ldquo;a wonderful actor, a wonderful man.&rdquo; Loren declared that Jackson had &ldquo;climbed every mountain!&rdquo; Jackson, topping off the evening, said he was thrilled to be feted alongside Taylor, &ldquo;whom I love very much,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;incredible&rdquo; Peck, who is, he said, &ldquo;a dear, dear friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://mjjtime.blogspot.com/2011/01/today-in-mjj-history_27.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Michael Jackson For All Time&rdquo; blog (January 27, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjjtime.blogspot.com/2011/01/today-in-mjj-history_27.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (NOTE: this seems to be the only source, so take with a grain of salt; only kept in due to Chris Cadman&rsquo;s inclusion in his &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Among Michael&#39;s guests at the award presentation were Janet, Tito, and Jermaine. The award ceremony was a little late getting started, as Michael showed up two hours late. When he finally showed up, dressed in a red shirt, and black military jacket, Sophia Loren presented Michael with his award, and he gave an incredible three minute speech. &quot;I&#39;m giving a long speech because I&#39;m not on television.&quot; In fact, no cameras were allowed to film him. In his speech, Michael spoke of his deep affection for fellow honoree Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor had had similar praise for Michael in her own speech saying she was happy to be honored with &quot;my beloved Michael, whom I would have loved and admired if I had never seen him dance or heard him sing.&quot;</span></p></body>
