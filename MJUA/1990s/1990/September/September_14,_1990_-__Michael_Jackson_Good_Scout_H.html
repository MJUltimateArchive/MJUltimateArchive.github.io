Jackson, 31, has raised thousands of dollars for such charities as the Make-A-Wish Foundation, The Prince&#39;s Trust, the United Negro College Fund and Child Help USA. Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Co., will preside over a Sept. 14 dinner at which the reclusive pop star will receive the Michael Jackson Good Scout Humanitarian Award. Future candidates for the award will be selected by the Boy Scouts and officials at Jackson&#39;s company, MJJ Productions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-17-vw-654-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;LA Times&rdquo; (September 17, 1990)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627163159/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-17-vw-654-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He may not look like the quintessential Boy Scout, but apparently singer Michael Jackson has the right Boy Scout stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Enough to earn him an award in his name: the Michael Jackson Good Scout Humanitarian Award. It was bestowed upon him Friday night at a benefit dinner at the Century Plaza as some 700 guests gave him many standing ovations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael Jackson is a good example to youth, helping us keep kids off the streets by supporting Scouting,&quot; said Ray Martin, chairman of the board of Los Angeles Area Council Boy Scouts of America.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yes, but is he brave, trustworthy and reverent? Would he have made a good Boy Scout even though there are no badges given for glove-wearing or multiple buckle-fastening?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Yes, I think he epitomizes what&#39;s good about kids,&quot; said Martin, also chairman and CEO of Coast Federal Bank. &quot;He supports what the scouting programs are doing, giving kids an alternative to street gangs.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Perhaps Jackson represents the change of image that Boy Scouts have undergone. In Los Angeles at least, the Norman Rockwellesque vision of the freshly scrubbed Boy Scout in a khaki uniform and kerchief doesn&#39;t always hold true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We used to be such a traditional organization, dealing only with kids in middle- and higher-income families,&quot; Martin said. &quot;Now we&#39;re reaching out to lower-income inner-city kids. We&#39;re modifying, changing with the times. If you go to a Scout summer camp you won&#39;t see kids with kerchiefs on, you&#39;ll see kids who are finding out what it&#39;s like to go swimming for the first time.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The evening began with a VIP reception where Jackson posed for pictures in a corner of the room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;God, I feel sorry for him,&quot; said one on-looker as Jackson appeared trapped by the crowd around him. &quot;It&#39;s like he&#39;s in a cage.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As soon as the photo session was over, Jackson--wearing a studded leather jacket, silver-tipped cowboy boots and sunglasses that he never took off--escaped through a narrow passage in the back, and emerged later at the dinner in the main ballroom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was joined there by Chuck Norris, Scott Baio, Telly Savalas, Fred Travalena, Rick Pallack (who had received his own scouting award a few months ago) and Barbara Davis with her children. Some of Jackson&#39;s family, including his mother, also were on hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sportscaster Jim Hill (an Eagle Scout) emceed the show, headlined by singer Stephanie Mills. A Michael Jackson video showed screaming fans interspersed with concert footage, more screaming fans, video clips, screaming fans, interviews with celebrities about Michael Jackson, and more screaming fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Eisner, chairman of the board and CEO of the Walt Disney Co., was dinner chairman and presented the award to Jackson, saying, &quot;I wasn&#39;t a Boy Scout but I was an Indian Guide, and we all know that&#39;s a whole different level.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To the delight of his fans, Jackson said more than his usual breathy, pithy &quot;thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;On behalf of the millions of past, present and future Boy Scouts,&quot; he said, &quot;I will try to abide by your motto of being prepared, and always extending a hand to others.&quot;</span></p></body>
