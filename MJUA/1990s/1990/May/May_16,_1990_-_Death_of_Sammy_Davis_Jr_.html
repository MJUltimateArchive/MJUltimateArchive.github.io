His father was a lead dancer in vaudeville, and through him the little boy grew up with a personal link to a vibrant mainstream of American entertainment. He was the heir to such tap dancers as Bill &ldquo;Bojangles&rdquo; Robinson and a contemporary of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Lena Home. He was one of the first black entertainers to break the color barrier, the first to play mixed audiences in Vegas and Miami, and the first to have his own TV talk show (</span><span class="cs43C038A">Sammy &amp; Company</span><span class="csD5D7D290">). Onstage he poured his jittery energy into virtuoso performances with all the intimacy of a saloon singer. It was only toward the end, when disease cruelly slowed him, when young black entertainers began openly to acknowledge how much they owed him, that he came into real focus&mdash;not as a Junior, not as the Rat Pack crony of Frank and Dino and Joey, not with the jewels and quirky mannerisms, not attached to anything but his own talent. Just Sammy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For once, then, the testimonials that flowed from the stars seemed truly heartfelt. &ldquo;It was a generous God who gave him to us, and a heaven with his magic gives me warmth,&rdquo; said Frank Sinatra. &ldquo;He was the ultimate performer,&rdquo; echoed Eddie Murphy, &ldquo;a trailblazer for all of us who would follow in his footsteps.&rdquo; Liza Minnelli called him &ldquo;the most all-around talented person I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo; A tearful Michael Jackson pronounced himself &ldquo;too overcome with grief to talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/sammy-davis-dies-64-throat-cancer-1990-article-1.2390095"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs8567212B"><a class="cs8567212B" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/sammy-davis-dies-64-throat-cancer-1990-article-1.2390095"><span>Daily News&rdquo; (May 17, 1990)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210114355/https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/sammy-davis-dies-64-throat-cancer-1990-article-1.2390095"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A unique piece of American history slipped away early yesterday morning when 64-year-old Sammy Davis Jr. finally succumbed to throat cancer in his Beverly Hills home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song-and-dance legend, who began his battle with cancer last September, died in his sleep at 5:59 a.m.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Davis is survived by his third wife, Altovise Gore (the two celebrated their 20th anniversary on Friday), four children - Tracey, Mark and Jeff from his second marriage, to May Britt, and Manny from his marriage to Altovise - and two grandchildren, Andrew and Sam Michael.
