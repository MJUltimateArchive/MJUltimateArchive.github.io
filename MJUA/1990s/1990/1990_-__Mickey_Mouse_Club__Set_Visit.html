I caught up with the guys, all 34.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael&rsquo;s style heavily influenced them, given that Damon&rsquo;s renditions of Michael&rsquo;s Another Part of Me and The Way You Make Me Feel scored him the coveted role on the Disney Channel show, and Albert hailed from Michael&rsquo;s hometown of Gary, Indiana, and was a featured performer on Oprah Winfrey&lsquo;s AM Chicago. Chasen learned how to dance thanks to Michael&rsquo;s trademark moves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael came to the set of the Mickey Mouse Club when he was over at Disney,&rdquo; Damon remembers. &ldquo;They brought him over to say &lsquo;hello&rsquo; to us, and we all got an autographed, personalized picture.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was a dream come true. The Houston, Texas, native vowed to his classmates he&rsquo;d meet the Gloved One after he performed Billie Jean for his second grade talent show, and found his wish granted at age 12.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to Damon, Michael&rsquo;s security was tight. &ldquo;It was very controlled. They built up a barrier &ndash; a wall &ndash; around our soundstage to where there was no way no one was going to enter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What was Michael really like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was one of those weird things where you didn&rsquo;t really think he existed because he was such an unbelievable performer,&rdquo; Damon says. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think he was human, and to see him was just like &lsquo;oh my God, he exists.&rsquo; [laughs] It&rsquo;s surreal. As a young kid, you think &lsquo;maybe he&rsquo;s not real.&rsquo; You think of him as a superhero. His skin was flawless. He looked exactly how you would see him on posters. The hat, the hair, the whole nine. It was a trip.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although the cast never got a photo with him, they did get autographs. Damon says the photos weren&rsquo;t signed in front of them. &ldquo;They took him somewhere, did it, and gave everybody one after the fact.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He shares, &ldquo;I have a framed autograph here in my possession. It was the same for everybody. It says, &lsquo;To the Mouseketeers, my favorite club in the whole world, you all really inspire me. I love your wonderful show. All my love. I love you all. Michael Jackson.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of their meeting, Damon says, &ldquo;We got to shake his hand, that was it. He said &lsquo;great to meet all you guys.&rsquo; I was pretty starstruck at the time. I certainly didn&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For Albert, who grew up in Michael&rsquo;s hometown of Gary, Indiana, the interaction was more personal. He got 1:1 time with him backstage for about ten minutes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That was the first thing we touched on &ndash; &lsquo;hey, I&rsquo;m from Gary, too,&rsquo;&rdquo; Albert says. &ldquo;It was amazing because he influenced me and everybody else, especially for me being where I&rsquo;m from and my family witnessing him as a kid and going to school with his brothers and sisters. It was incredible, and he was cool, like &lsquo;I enjoyed the show, I watch the show, and it&rsquo;s cool to be here.&rsquo; Because he wanted to come and see us filming it. He said he loved the show and he liked what we did on there. The singing, dancing, acting. He said &lsquo;you guys are triple threats.&rsquo; It was crazy. That was the conversation &ndash; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m your homeboy&rsquo; type thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Albert continues, &ldquo;He did have something that was absolutely mesmerizing, even standing there &ndash; the sound of his voice. Everything about him was insane. It was a big thing to meet him and look him in the face. I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you &ndash; it was a little weird. It was easy to get lost in his eyes and dream of puppies and rainbows.&rdquo; He chuckles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Disney and Michael Jackson were quite a pair. The King of Pop&rsquo;s Captain EO attraction was part of EPCOT, Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Albert says, &ldquo;We all know that he was a fan of Disney and Peter Pan, so I think Michael Eisner or Jeffrey Katzenberg were with him at the time. They&rsquo;re the ones who brought him over. And [Disney-]MGM Studios was new, so the Mickey Mouse Club was an attraction he wanted to see, seeing that the show was being filmed there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What more does he remember about his Michael encounter? Well, Albert says the King of Pop was taller than he expected and looked plastic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He shook my hand very soft,&rdquo; Albert shares. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like that. You know how people give you the soft hand? He did that. But other than that, I was in awe. But he was cool because he was down-to-earth. He was having a conversation that was genuinely happy. It was genuine when he was saying &lsquo;I like what you do.&rsquo; It was happy. And it wasn&rsquo;t a creepy thing. He just had an aura like a vacuum that sucks you in, and you go &lsquo;ahh! Wait a minute.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chasen admits the day was one he will never forget.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was larger than life. He believed in the Disney Magic. He loved our show, and said he used to watch it every day he could. That alone made me bust at the seams with excitement. He was telling us that he was our fan. What power onstage, and such a beautiful man offstage. He was never scared to say what most of us won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
