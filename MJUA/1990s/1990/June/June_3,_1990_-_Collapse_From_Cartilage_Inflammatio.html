He continued to feel the pains while in the hospital.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tests, ordered by Jackson&#39;s physician, cardiologist Mark Zatzkis, revealed no physical abnormalities other than the inflammation, Jones said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is expected to receive follow-up treatment after he is released from the hospital, &#39;probably within 48 hours,&#39; Jones said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said the inflammation can be caused by &#39;overexertion and stress and is usually extremely painful,&#39; adding that the performer&#39;s condition &#39;will absolutely not affect his career.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The clean-living, lean pop star, who shuns alcohol, cigarettes and junk food, has no history of serious health problems. But Jones said the recent deaths of his maternal grandmother and of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., a close friend, had put Jackson under some stress.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In addition, the excruciatingly shy star has been working on a new album, titled, &#39;Decade,&#39; that is eight months overdue and now scheduled to be released in August.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was visited Wednesday by his brothers, Jackie, Marlon and Randy, and his sister, Rebbie, who briefly greeted fans keeping vigil at the hospital.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of those at the hospital Wednesday, a man identified as Jackie Lee Adams, 27, was arrested for allegedly making death threats directed at Jackson while being questioned by hospital guards, Police Sgt. John Miehle said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The guards had asked Adams to leave the hospital grounds when he told them he was going to see Jackson, Miehle said. Adams, who was unarmed, refused and while under further questioning, &#39;made some threats against Michael&#39;s life,&#39; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Adams was arrested on suspicion of giving false information to a police officer, trespassing and making threats of bodily harm, a felony, Miehle said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Monday, a woman who identifies herself as Billie Jean Jackson and is apparently obsessed with the singer was arrested for allegedly violating a restraining order to stay away from Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During his stay at the hospital, Jackson has visited his friend, actress Elizabeth Taylor, who has been recovering at St. John&#39;s from a near-fatal bout with pneumonia since mid-April.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808121305/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dangerous_1990.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; (1990)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael Jackson was undergoing hospital tests yesterday after complaining of crushing chest pains.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The health and fitness fanatic has insisted that doctors in California should spare no expense in finding out what is wrong with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His private bed at St. John&#39;s Hospital in Santa Monica is thought alone to be costing around &pound;1,000 a night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The star was rushed to St. John&#39;s after being taken ill at night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hospital spokesman Paulette Weir said yesterday: &quot;According to his physician, he is in a stable condition and appropriate tests are being conducted.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s heroine--British actress Liz Taylor, 58--is being treated in another ward at the same clinic.
