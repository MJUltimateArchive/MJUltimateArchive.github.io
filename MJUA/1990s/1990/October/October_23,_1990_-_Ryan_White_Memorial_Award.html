The award, which will be given next spring by Jeanne White, Ryan&#39;s mother, commemorates the stars&#39; friendship and dedication to her son. Ryan died earlier this year at the age of 18 of complications from AIDS. White and her son lived in Cicero. &quot;I&#39;m very happy to continue Ryan&#39;s work,&quot; said White in announcing the award Tuesday at an Athletes and Entertainers for Kids ceremony in Los Angeles. &quot;Ryan&#39;s desire was to help all young people through education and to learn to make better decisions concerning their lives for a better tomorrow.&quot; LA Lakers basketball star Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Olympic diving gold medalist Greg Louganis were among those who attended the charity event. One of Ryan&#39;s prized possessions was a car given to him by Jackson. John sang at Ryan&#39;s funeral and had kept a hospital vigil with the family in the days before the teen died. Ryan, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS through blood-clotting products, won a court battle to continue attending public school in Indiana and spent his final years speaking on behalf of AIDS victims.</span></p></body>
