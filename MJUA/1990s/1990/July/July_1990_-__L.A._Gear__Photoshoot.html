Gear&quot; Photoshoot</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jennifer Love Hewitt, actress for one of the photoshoot advertisements, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/UCWnQ0vE5d4"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&rdquo; (September 5, 2018)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jimmy Kimmel: I mentioned in your introduction that you&#39;ve been working since you were a little kid, and this is a photograph I would love to get more information on, because this is something that you posted online.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jennifer Love Hewitt: Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: That&#39;s you and, obviously, Michael Jackson. Or is that a wax figure? Is that really Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: It&#39;s really Michael Jackson. I was 10 years old. I got to spend the day with him doing an L.A. Gear commercial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: L.A. Gear?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Yes, when he did—</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fallon Kimmel: I forgot about L.A. Gear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: All the shoes had the Michael Jackson buckle on them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: They just told me that I was going to shoot a commercial for the day with Michael, and I was like, &quot;Okay, cool, like a fun, little kid named Michael. That will be great.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: You didn&#39;t know it was that Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: No. And then I got there, everybody was, like, super serious, and it was all really hush-hush. They were — there were protocols. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then it was Michael Jackson, and I was like, &quot;Oh my God.&quot; And I—now, thinking back on it, if I&#39;d been in my 20s, I probably would have pood my pants a little bit, like, &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m about to work with Michael Jackson!&quot; At 10, it was like, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s so cool, this is going to be really fun.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a big deal. I was really excited about Bubbles the monkey.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: The chimp was there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: I got to meet Bubbles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Oh, really?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Yes! And it was super exciting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Bubbles would come on commercial shoots?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Yes! He was just there, hanging out. it was amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Did you pet him or touch him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Of course, I high-fived.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: You didn&#39;t get any pictures with Bubbles?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: I did not.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Did you spend any time with Michael, talking with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: We spent the whole day together, we were dancing together. He taught me to do his &quot;go up on the toes&quot; thing, which I can&#39;t do now. Anyway, it was amazing. At the end of the day—here&#39;s what I loved about him most. At the end of the day, I had to go to this charity function, and it meant that the commercial sort of had to be shut down at a weird time, then he had to go. He stopped at the end of the day, he was like, &quot;You don&#39;t know how important it is that you&#39;re doing something that&#39;s special and important for other people.&quot; And he was like, &quot;Never lose that, always be that person.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Wow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: And I was like, &quot;Okay, yes, sir. Absolutely, okay&quot;, and he wrote a very big donation to this charity function that I was going to that night, and sent a check in my name on my behalf, which is not something that I would have been able to do at the time, sent it just to sort of button how important it is to give to other people, and to do that. And I just thought that was extraordinary, because he&#39;s Michael Jackson, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Yeah, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: He didn&#39;t have to do that, and he really took his time. And then I got to go to Neverland Ranch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Oh, you did? So, you kept in touch with Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Yeah, later, I got to keep in touch with him. My Mom and I went and—you know, when they would have big parties and stuff like that, we went a few times.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: What parties did you go to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: It was amazing. We went on Thanksgiving one year, which was incredible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Really? Wait a minute.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Yes!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: You were invited to the Jackson family Thanksgiving dinner?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: Well, it wasn&#39;t just them and me and my mom, &quot;Pass the turkey.&quot; That would have been incredicray.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: ...Wow, Michael Jackson, that&#39;s something else.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: It was amazing. It was amazing. It was one of those big life moments where you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, this is extraordinary.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kimmel: Did you have turkey at the Jacksons? They didn&#39;t like carve up a giraffe or anything?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hewitt: There was a turkey. There was a giant candy store on the property that made fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies, there was a ferris wheel—I mean, it was truly amazing.</span></p></body>
