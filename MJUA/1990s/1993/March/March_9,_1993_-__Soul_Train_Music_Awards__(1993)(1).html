But I wanted to come here to thank everybody.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides picking up his own awards (best R&amp;B male album, R&amp;B male single and a special humanitarian citation) in the Tuesday night ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium, Jackson performed &quot;Remember the Time,&quot; which he turned into a show-stopping production number despite being confined to a wheelchair.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also presented Eddie Murphy the Heritage Award for career achievement. Joking with Jackson, the comedian-actor told the audience, &quot;Isn&#39;t it nice to see him getting out and giving people awards. . . . I&#39;d like to thank Michael for hobbling out here and giving me this award.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don Cornelius, executive producer of the TV special, summed up Jackson&#39;s whirlwind appearance. &quot;Nobody was disappointed,&quot; he said backstage. &quot;Here&#39;s a guy who was sitting in a chair with a bad leg and the energy was almost as high as it would have been if he had not been injured.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Soul Train Awards, the most prestigious R&amp;B awards competition, are based on a survey of 3,000 radio programmers and record retailers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Other major winners included Whitney Houston, who gave birth last week to a daughter and wasn&#39;t on hand to accept the best female single award for her &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; Boyz II Men, the young vocal quartet, was honored for best group single, for &quot;Please Don&#39;t Go,&quot; and best music video and best song for their hit &quot;End of the Road.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Awards were also presented to En Vogue, group album and the Sammy Davis Jr. award for entertainer of the year; Mary J.

The black tradition is a tradition of soul which is a gift of love and joy. Soul is the most precious thing you can share because you&#39;re sharing yourself and the world needs that gift now more than ever. The child with AIDS, in the ghetto, is waiting for you along with the starving people in Africa and everyone else who needs healing. Make the world more beautiful by sharing with me the wonderful feeling you get when your soul is lifted up to become pure love. I accept this award on behalf of all the children of the world who are my inspiration and my hope. Thank you, Dr. Deepak Chopra, Mohan Rajani, Chuck Hirsch, Sandy Galan and Jim Morey, BET and all the black program directors and DJs for keeping my music on the air. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[After arriving on stage to accept &ldquo;Best R&amp;B/Soul Single&rdquo; for &ldquo;Remember The Time&rdquo;]:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you again, I love you all.
