Our goal is to change the world and change world consciousness about children, the ecology and the planet, to make it a better place for everybody, starting with the children. That&rsquo;s the future we live, and I&rsquo;ll stick with it forever until it&rsquo;s done. It&rsquo;s forever. It&rsquo;s not a publicity stunt, it&rsquo;s not something trying to use as a vehicle to launch a single or an album, it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s directly from my heart; I&rsquo;m doing it as I sincerely care and love them and want to help out. I really feel bad for these kids. I guess you feel the pain just hearing about the things we see on television or on the radio, you know, the statistics about the kids&hellip;I mean, I&rsquo;ve heard about this year, 2.6 million children die from preventable diseases and millions of children die from child abuse, just violence which it doesn&rsquo;t have to be and I just feel so bad from things like that. You know sometimes I feel so guilty when I have dinner or breakfast, because I realize how so many people don&rsquo;t have those simple things that we so much take for granted. And people, they sit at the table and they pray and all that, which is beautiful, but to do something is the thing, you know, you have to act, so I think it&rsquo;s important to help out as much as you can. If one person just helped one child&hellip;just helped one child&hellip;they&rsquo;d done so much. You can do that, it would be beautiful, just to help one person would be a lot, it&rsquo;s a big step forward, because it&rsquo;s a lot to be done, and children all over the world are in such need. I feel so pure when I can do this, I feel God applauding, I really do; I feel that I&rsquo;ve done what I&rsquo;m supposed to do and I&rsquo;m compelled to do these things, I feel. And kids are the best; they are wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The concept behind this CD release was to give it away to customers who purchased a Sony Walkman. On this rare CD was a voice over message over Heal The World for his foundation of the same name. Plus the rare Spanish version of I Just Can&rsquo;t Stop Loving You (Todo Mi Amor Eres) and exclusive remixes for Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo; by Georgie Porgie and Tommy D, respectively.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately this CD was shelved after the allegations that occurred in 1993. Only 50 given to Sony Executives are believed to exist after failing to get past the pre production stages.</span></p></body>
