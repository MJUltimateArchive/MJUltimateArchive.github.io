I knew I could capture his soul by focusing on his eyes and that&rsquo;s exactly what happened with that photo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But was Jackson actually covering his face due to shyness? &ldquo;Maybe. But his shyness and introversion never hindered his ability to work with me as a photographer. Michael knew exactly what he wanted artistically&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p></body>
