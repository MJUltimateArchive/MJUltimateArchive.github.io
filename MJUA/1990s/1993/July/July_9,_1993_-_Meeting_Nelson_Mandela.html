The image, which Funk describes as the highlight of his career, shows the trio smiling infectiously.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Mandela was so excited to meet Michael,&rdquo; says Funk. &ldquo;He flew in all of his family especially. I was told by the publicists I had no time to shoot, but Michael kicked them all out and let me take my time. I didn&rsquo;t want a boring photo so I suggested they jump on each other&rsquo;s backs and hug one another. Liz Taylor said, &lsquo;Harrison, you know I&rsquo;ve got a bad back!&rsquo; And Nelson said he was too old and joked he wanted to put his feet up instead. I tried to capture the joy of this incredible moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Funk then watched as the three went into a meeting room to discuss plans to topple apartheid, improve women&rsquo;s rights, tackle the Aids crisis, and address crime in Africa. He claims Jackson was acutely aware of how the photo could help Mandela&rsquo;s bid for the South African presidency.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That image was in something like 400 newspapers. It was real powerful. The next year, Michael went to Africa to shoot the They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us video. He would have done anything for Nelson &ndash; Michael and Liz gave his presidential campaign a very generous donation. I believe he and Nelson got on so well as Michael was like the Mandela of music, in the sense that he too broke down a lot of barriers. Remember, Michael was one of the first global black superstars.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
