He remembers sitting with the singer in the home theatre of his Neverland ranch while watching What&rsquo;s Love Got To Do With It, the 1993 biopic about the abusive relationship between Ike and Tina Turner, when Jackson began to cry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The scene where Ike beats on Tina was playing and Michael started to tear up. I asked him if he wanted me to stop the film but he signalled to keep it rolling. He squeezed my hand tightly. I really felt his humanity in that moment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;After the film ended, we walked out of the theatre and Michael asked me to go do bumper cars with him.&rdquo; Funk laughs. &ldquo;We played pretty nasty and really went for one another.
