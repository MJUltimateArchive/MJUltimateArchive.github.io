Michael cared about finding new artists and discovering and developing the best music possible. I put together a small team of music industry veterans at MJJ Music and we worked in conjunction with Sony/Epic Records who did much of the marketing, promotion and merchandising.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJJ&#39;s first release, the soundtrack to the 1993 Warner Bros. film &quot;Free Willy&quot; garnered a Platinum Record. The theme song from Free Willy, &quot;Will You Be There&quot; was penned, co- produced with Bruce Swedien and performed by Michael Jackson. This was followed by hits from Brownstone, 3T, Tatyana Ali, Rebbie Jackson and others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Greenberg continues, &quot;Working closely with Michael, I came to know someone who was one of the kindest, caring and most loving people I have ever known. He loved his nephews 3T dearly and worked very closely with them on their music, it was a special time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael&#39;s work with charities and caring for children all over the world was endless. One of the most poignant statements Michael made to me, and which I will always remember was &#39;Jerry, children will never lie to you, they always tell you the truth.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Losing Michael is probably the most incredible loss to the entire entertainment world and especially to those of us who knew and loved him. When it comes to the accomplishments and legend of Michael Jackson, no one will ever &#39;Beat It&#39;. I will miss my friend and colleague.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.bitememf.com/2010/08/interview-with-jerry-greenberg.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Bite Me!

He was going to form his own record label and he asked me to come on board as President. I was with Michael Jackson for 10 years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">What was Michael like as a person?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wonderful. He was an incredible human being. The kindest, nicest, most wonderful guy I&rsquo;ve ever met. He was really a God gifted entertainer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">I heard that he was brilliant in that regard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was a perfectionist. He had perfect pitch, which the only other person I know who had that was Roberta Flack. He would record a vocal track ten times to make sure it was absolutely correct. He had such a good sense about music. I wasn&rsquo;t with the company for more than two weeks and he called me up in the middle of the night and said, &ldquo;Jerry did you see Sister Act 2?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;. He said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl in the movie that you have to see.&rdquo; It was the lead singer of the Fugees, Lauryn Hill. He said, &ldquo;I want to sign her.&rdquo; I knew who managed the group so I called him and said, &ldquo;Michael, I found out she is in a group called The Fugees, but I spoke to their manager and if the first record doesn&rsquo;t happen I think she would love to do a solo record with us.&rdquo; Obviously, the first record happened and we never got her, but it shows you that Michael can spot talent and what his gut instinct was. She turned out to be a big star. I had a great time working with Michael and when I look back at my career and I think about all the artists that I worked with at Atlantic and then Michael for ten years. That was a treat. I&rsquo;d wake up and say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really paying me to do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">It&rsquo;s great to be paid to do what you love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Absolutely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">You&rsquo;ve put together a number of soundtracks. What is involved with putting a soundtrack together?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I also put together the soundtrack for Free Willy. They called me when I first joined MJJ and they wanted Michael to look at the movie and write a new song. He looked at the movie and loved it but told me he didn&rsquo;t have time to write a song so I told him, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we use &#39;Will You be There,&#39;&rdquo; which was from his album </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dangerous</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> , &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll find some other songs and it could be a record we release on MJJ.&rdquo; He loved the idea. Then there was a group called SWV and 3T, which were his nephews, and we had a soundtrack.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span><span class="cs31D24DEE">What else would you still like to accomplish?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s interesting because I am doing a lot of different things, and I am filled with a lot of energy. I am involved with a play that I did with Michael called Sisterella. It opened at the Pasadena Playhouse, and we are reactivating that again. It&rsquo;s kind of like Dreamgirls meets The Whiz.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">in August 2010 [Jerry Greenberg] said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael could spot talent. I remember him calling me up one night, real excited. He&#39;d just seen Sister Act 2, which featured Lauryn Hill. Nobody really knew about her at the time, but Michael wanted to sign her. I made a few calls and was told that if things didn&#39;t go well with the Fugees, she&#39;d sign solo with us.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (March 31, 2015)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jeffrey Daniel formerly of the music group, Shalamar, was made A&amp; R representative.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Groups signed:]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">3T</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brownstone</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quo</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rebbie Jackson</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tatyana Ali</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nathan Cavaleri</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No Authority</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Men Of Vizion</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tasha Scott</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jason Bonham Band</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Civisca</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Free Willy Soundtracks I &amp; II</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trippin</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jerry Greenberg left in February, 2001 to re-launch Mirage Records.</span></p></body>
