MC Hammer mentions in his conversation that the video isn&rsquo;t complete yet, so it was most likely during this period.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A"><a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://youtu.be/peKv0RzqftA"><span class="cs8567212B">MC Hammer, hip-hop artist, &ldquo;The Wendy Williams Show&rdquo; (July 27, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Wendy Williams:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I understand that you had a telephone conversation with Michael Jackson... about who dances the best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MC Hammer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it&#39;s because of the &quot;2 Legit 2 Quit&quot; video. I had this little part in there, and Michael called me, and I asked him--first of all, I didn&#39;t believe him. I hung up the first time. Yeah, I really did. My wife was laying right there. &quot;Uh-huh. Somebody playing like they&#39;re MJ.&quot; Then he called back, and the only reason why I really knew it was him, was because somebody walked in his room. And he said, &quot;Close the door! I&#39;m trying to talk to Hammer.&quot; I said, &quot;Wait, oh, this is Michael... Michael, look, you&#39;re the greatest, man. You&#39;re the greatest dancer I&#39;ve ever seen. I mean, I&#39;ve been watching you since I was a kid. I love you, buddy.&quot; &quot;No, Hammer, you&#39;re really good.&quot; I said, &quot;No, but you&#39;re the greatest.&quot; &quot;No, Hammer, I like the way you do it.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, the reason why I sent you a message was I wanted to say at the end of the &lsquo;2 Legit 2 Quit&rsquo; video, if you want me to take that out, even though it&#39;s just the &lsquo;2 Legit&rsquo;. And I asked James Brown to give me the power recipes to get the glove. If you don&#39;t like any of this, I&#39;ll take it out.&quot; He said, &quot;Oh no, Hammer, I think it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s not offi-&quot; I said, &quot;Wait a minute, how did you see it? I&#39;m not done yet.&quot; He says &quot;Oh, no, I got my ways.&quot;</span></p></body>
