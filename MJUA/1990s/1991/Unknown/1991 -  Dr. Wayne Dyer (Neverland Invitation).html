He was capable of looking at a fingertip, he was capable of looking at the tiniest of things, he was capable of looking at a fly, and he was capable of seeing the infinite in that. And he wanted to... he was profoundly good, because his generosity to his fellow human beings and his sense of obligation on their part was almost boundless. He felt he had been given an astonishing gift by God, and that was that ability to see absolutely stunning things in almost anything he looked at. And he felt it was his obligation to give that experience to you, to me, to everybody he possibly could on this planet. And he put his entire life on the line to fulfill that obligation. He was - again, generalizations don&#39;t capture it - he was beyond anything I&#39;d ever imagined in my life. And remember, I&#39;d worked with Bette Midler and Bob Marley and AC/DC, Aerosmith and KISS and Queen, but on the more positive side, Billy Joel and Paul Simon and all kinds of amazing people. And if you&#39;d stacked five of those people end to end you wouldn&#39;t have gotten one Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.drwaynedyer.com/blog/real-magic-and-michael/"><span class="cs8567212B">Personal blog (July 10, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090717214831/http://www.drwaynedyer.com/blog/real-magic-and-michael/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1992 when the time came to write a dedication for my book </span><span class="cs43C038A">Real Magic</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, I decided to recognize three special people&mdash;my dear daughter Saje, my spiritual brother Deepak Chopra, and my friend pop superstar Michael Jackson. I wanted to recognize Michael &ldquo;whose words, music, and love remind us that it is only through giving that we are saving our own lives.&rdquo; Michael Jackson had a special relationship with the principles of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Real Magic</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, the idea of &ldquo;creating miracles in everyday life.&rdquo; &nbsp;With his enormous musical talent, he created a body of work that brought joy to millions. My children and I spent five very happy days with him at Neverland in 1991. He wanted to talk to me about &ldquo;real magic,&rdquo; but the truth is, he already had the magic&mdash;the power he needed to dream and create and give. Michael was dedicated to ending world hunger and helped create the 1985 &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; celebrity sing-along that brought together some of the biggest names in popular music to raise funds for famine relief in Africa. I didn&rsquo;t have to explain &ldquo;real magic&rdquo; to Michael because he was already a spiritual being, already kind, loving, and ready to use his musical gift to create miracles. Along with millions of people around the world, I say, thank you, Michael, for sharing your amazing talent to lift our spirits. I&rsquo;ll remember you as a beautiful human being with a heart as big as the sky</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Partial transcript, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/wyCZ4x0cmmg"><span class="cs8567212B">unknown radio interview (July 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I know for absolute certain that this is a man who could never have done anything that would be harmful to anyone. He was very much a child himself. He was as kind and decent and spiritual a human being as I ever had the pleasure of spending any time with. I dedicated one of my books to him. When you look at his enormous talent and the commitment that he had to ending world hunger, for example &ndash; he personally was responsible for cutting the number of people starving to death on this planet IN HALF back in the 1980s and the 1990s with &ldquo;We are the World&rdquo;. And he took no money for it at all. ... This was a beautiful, beautiful human being &ndash; someone who will go down in history as one of the greatest entertainers EVER, but more than the great entertainer this was a great man... In my time with him in those five days with him back in 1991 solidified for me that this was a transcendent being who had not only enormous talent but a heart as big as the sky.</span></p></body>
