In the studio, the engineer sat me in front of the console, gave me a list of tracks and clicked &ldquo;play&rdquo;. Through the glass I could see more people sitting in different parts of the studio, one of them was Michael, who was a little restless. I am one of those people who like to hear a song over and over again, but that time there was only one listener, and only one. Then they took us back to the limo and to the office of Sandy Gallin, Michael&#39;s manager. &#39;What do you think?&#39; He asked. &#39;It sounds fantastic,&#39; I said as I pulled out the list of tracks. An alarmed look was drawn on Sandy&#39;s face. &#39;Where the hell did you get that ?!&#39;, and he tore it out of my hands saying it was totally confidential.</span></p></body>
