The entire banqueting room had been extravagantly decorated with images from the album sleeve and, while the album was played, [illegible] and a shortened version of the &quot;Black or White&quot; vid were simultaneously projected on screens around the room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The highlight of the evening was a personal filmed message from Michael himself, who regretted not being able to attend the party in person, but said how much he loved everyone in Britain anyway!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After the playback, guests, including DJs Gary Davies, Pat Sharp, and Simon Bates, were several champagne from special Michael Jackson bottles. Other Jacksonabalia include After Eight mints in Jackson wrappers!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103755/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dangerousreviewspart2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Melody Maker (1991)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael&#39;s upper half appears on the screen to apologize for not being able to be with us, and to whisper softly that he loves us all very, very much, each and every one of us...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103326/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dangerousreviews.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then the rumble west found that the big doors were going to open at any minute, and, blimey, Michael was going to make a surprise entrance, presumably because he loved us all so much. Instead, he read his message off the [illegible] into a camera. It&#39;s the thought that counts.</span></p></body>
