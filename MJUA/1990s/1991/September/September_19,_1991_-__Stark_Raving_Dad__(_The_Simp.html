The phone rings, and I pick it up. &quot;Hello&quot;? &quot;Hi, this is Michael Jackson.&quot;... And I said [motions hanging up phone] click, right? And he called me, &quot;No, it really is, don&#39;t hang up!&quot;, because he has a voice that sounds like somebody doing a Michael Jackson bit. And he said that he loved Bart, and wanted to be on the show. Now, how is it that he--the rumors that he didn&#39;t do the show? He did do the show, he didn&#39;t want credit for it, there was some kind of deal with his record company or whatever. So, when it came time to sing the songs, he had a sound-a-like singer, and he stood there and watched the guy, who was so nervous, who had to sound like Michael Jackson. And then he giggled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Yeardley Smith on Michael Jackson, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/dRn_eheZJfA"><span class="cs8567212B">EmmyTVLegends.org interview</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/bcZgN2e4d1g?t=56m44s"><span class="cs8567212B">Full</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeardley Smith: I remember he wore his fedora and he wore his high water pants and his white socks. And he was very very soft-spoken. He was very very quiet. Very polite, very respectful. I also remember, he turned his light off... This is at the time actually where we were recording in the basement of the Zanuck Theater and so- and it wasn&#39;t very well lit, it wasn&#39;t setup for that, we were just sort of the interlopers for ten years or whatever... So you have a little light on your music stand, we still have &#39;em. And he turned his off. And I remember thinking, &quot;How can you see that? How you can see? How can you see?&quot;... You know, he worked on &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;. And so he worked quite closely with Nancy [Cartwright (voice of &quot;Bart Simpson&quot;)] on that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">EmmyTVLegends: But he wasn&#39;t allowed to sing, I read, because of his label or something?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Smith: Yeah, it was weird. So, get this. So there was a guy, who on that day, had been hand-picked by Michael Jackson to sing like Michael Jackson in front of Michael Jackson for this record. And he&#39;s this little- at that time, quite young, small white man named Kipp [Lennon]... But he came and reprised his &quot;Lisa, It&#39;s Your Birthday&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl... Can you imagine the pressure, the anxiety of being in the room with Michael Jackson to sing as Michael Jackson. I just like- blew my mind. He nailed it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">EmmyTVLegends: It was a legal thing he couldn&#39;t do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Smith: I believe so. That&#39;s what we heard, that his label said. I don&#39;t know, it sounds like a bunch of hooey to me, but, for whatever reason, he didn&#39;t sing &quot;Lisa, It&#39;s Your Birthday&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Kipp Lennon, Michael sound-alike, From Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;This is kind of weird,&rsquo; said Lennon at the time, &ldquo;[Michael&rsquo;s] right next to me and I have to do him in front of everyone, on command!&rdquo;</span></p></body>
