Aides to Kabila said the two discussed whether Jackson would play a celebration concert in Kinshasa to mark this month&#39;s first anniversary of the overthrow of despot Mobutu Sese Seko, following three decades of rule which left the economy in ruins. Jackson also explored the possibilities for investment in the former Zaire, according to the aides, who were present at the 20-minute meeting. Kabila arrived for the summit late Monday. Jackson was the guest at the opening of the summit Sunday of Namibian President Sam Nujoma, and addressed the gathering about his concerns for the world&#39;s homeless and abused children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and a US business partner have held several meetings with Namibian government officials to discuss possible investments in Namibia. The summit, drawing southern African heads of state, key ministers and over 600 business leaders from 60 countries, was to hold a special session on the Democratic Republic of Congo later Tuesday. Tomorrow Michael and his crew may fly to South Africa.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs76EFAA84">The Namibian</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was mayhem at the Namibian-Angolan border post at Oshikango on Tuesday as the Police struggled to control hundreds of Angolans trying to cross onto Namibian soil to see and greet visiting superstar Michael Jackson. The eager Angolans were desperate to join the more than 1,000 Namibians who had gathered at the border town to salute the King of Pop, and Jackson did not disappoint them.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He beat it to the middle of the Angolan-Namibian border line to wave and greet fans from the war-ravaged country, before returning to the Namibian side. The pop icon was besieged on all his stops in northern Namibia, the area most affected by war during the country&#39;s struggle for liberation, drawing massive crowds wherever he went. From the moment Jackson flew into Ondangwa airport in President Nujoma&#39;s jet, the people took him to their hearts, welcoming the superstar as &quot;the son of all people&quot;. As he stepped off the jet at around 11h30 the up to 6,000 people who had gathered to welcome him erupted into celebration. The sound of African drums rang out, women ululated, others broke into traditional song and some even prayed, while children in the crowd started to sing &quot;Welcome Michael Jackson, the son of all people.&quot;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elderly woman in traditional dress confided to The Namibian that she was praying that God would spare this &quot;famous son of the world to fulfill his job, especially here in Namibia&quot;. Youngsters The Namibian spoke to hailed Jackson as &quot;a spiritual, social and political coordinator and conciliator&quot;. One very well-known traditional figure in the North, who shyly declined to be named, said he felt Jackson was coming as a religious man, &quot;an assistant to the suffering people, especially children&quot;, and to bring together people from different political beliefs.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being welcomed by his host in the North, well-known millionaire businessman George Namundjebo, the international superstar greeted children and waved to others in the crowd. Everyone wanted to meet him personally. Impressed with the star, they were unimpressed by the tight security which they felt should have been more relaxed. Then it was concert time as Jackson for once was the audience and was treated to a cultural fusion musical performance - the Oshikuku Music Group played a medley of the star&#39;s hit songs and the Ombili (Peace) Traditional Cultural Dance Group performed traditional dances to the beat of drums.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his visit to Oshikango the music star and his delegation toured the fast-developing Industrial Park, where once again the Police were at full stretch as thousands of people tried to get in to get a glimpse of Jackson. According to his new business partner, Don Barden of Barden International, Jackson was very impressed with developments at the Industrial Park. Barden, who apparently has business interests at Oshikango, said he would try to convince Jackson to invest at Oshikango as well. From Oshikango, the Jackson motorcade, accompanied by a &quot;public interest convoy&quot; of 200 vehicles, headed for host George Namundjebo&#39;s homestead at Olunghono, which has been transformed into a beautiful traditional, rural lodge, for lunch.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Oshikwanyama Traditional Dancers and Drummers were on hand to pound out a welcome for the beaming superstar, who appeared thrilled with his warm Northern welcome. Again, thousands of people had congregated at the homestead. Everyone wanted to see the pop legend and to shake his hand. Speaking on behalf of Jackson, Barden, said both he and Jackson had been overwhelmed by hospitality accorded them in the North and in Namibia in general.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barden added that Jackson, who met with both traditional and business leaders during Tuesday&#39;s short visit, planned to return to Namibia and also to Oshikango. Before returning to Windhoek later on Tuesday afternoon, Jackson donated television equipment and toys for the hospital at Oshakati.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
