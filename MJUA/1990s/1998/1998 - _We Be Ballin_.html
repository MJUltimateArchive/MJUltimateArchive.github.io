I am not sure why, but, at least 100 people out of nowhere have suddenly gained interest in this recording. Well here&#39;s the story in it&#39;s entirety...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I produced and co-wrote the title track from &quot;The Player&#39;s Club&quot; Movie (Ice Cube&#39;s Directorial Debut) entitled &quot;We Be Clubbin&#39;&quot; in 1997. The song was an instant hit and the following year, we all thought it to be a good idea to do a remix version of the song entitled &quot;We Be Ballin&#39;&quot; featuring Michael Jackson &amp; Shaquille O&#39;Neal. The song was to be released on an NBA Compilation album set to be released that year and was also going to be featured in the infamous NBA &quot;I Love This Game&quot; themed commercials. The NBA season was cut in half that year due to the player initiating a strike against the league and the entire project seemed to just disappear. The Song was HOTT and there was a lot of buzz around the song at that time but no one ever wanted to revive the idea and it was left alone. Any information that you may have about why so many folks are all of a sudden interested would be greatly appreciated. The only folks I know to have copies of the record are Michael Jackson, Ice Cube and myself and maybe less than a handful of other people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyway, hope this information helps you out, take care.</span></p></body>
