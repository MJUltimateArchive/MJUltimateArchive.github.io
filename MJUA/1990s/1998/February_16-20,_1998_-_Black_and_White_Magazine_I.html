You guys did a wonderful job, you are the best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael is now looking at the History n4 magazine. When he sees a picture from ITC taken while he is singing and has his hands on his ears.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Sandy Gallin adores this picture, I never understood why, I don&rsquo;t like it&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then he takes the B&amp;W magazine n24</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Oh, I&rsquo;ve never seen this issue!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">B&amp;W: We sent it to you!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael calls Bob Jones who is in the next room.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I didn&rsquo;t get this issue&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: Don&rsquo;t look at me like that! I sent you 3 packages three weeks ago, did you open them?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael is a little embarrassed and softly says:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: They were in there?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Bob, laughing: Sure! You must open these things, there&rsquo;s stuff for you in it!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I know, I didn&rsquo;t have the time&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: Also you need to tell me what to do with the statue&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: What statue?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: The statue from the Museum Grevin, your statue!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: What? It&rsquo;s arrived?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: Sure! It&rsquo;s in my office since many days, It&rsquo;s in pieces, I&rsquo;m waiting for you to tell me what to do with it! And anyway, don&rsquo;t ask me to assemble it cause I won&rsquo;t!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Can you send it to Neverland? &ndash; Smiling</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael goes on reading through the B&amp;W magazine, he looks at the cover:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Do the fans like this photo?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: They love it, everyone loved it.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then Michael turns the pages and stops of the Collectibles page and sees a picture of the Smile single and asks whether it came out in Europe:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: no, the single has been cancelled, it never came out&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: mmh! &ndash; Sighing</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Did you want it to come out?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Sure! Sony should have had that single come out! </span><span class="cs43C038A">&ndash; Saying this Michael has an upset expression on his face. Then he turns to the pages with the Life article pictures, and he starts smiling, looking at the photos of PJ he says:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: He is so cute with that microphone! He was doing his teeth on it!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Can we ask you how your family is doing?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Very well, thank you, actually my son was here yesterday, we had a photo session together&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Does he speak yet?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: No, not yet, but he can walk! He walks everywhere, he never stops!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then Michael looks at the pictures of Ghosts, those when he is making the faces, and burst out laughing.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: In 96 we went to NY to see Ghosts, after that the film has been modified: Is it Scary and Ghosts have been added to the original Soundtrack, who decided to do that?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Stan Winston thought we should put more songs in the film, so we did, but I thought that the first version was good, I was satisfied.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;Then he looks at a picture of him in SA walking with a bunch of kids.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: This photo is wonderful! Sir come see! &ndash; Bob Jones comes in again.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: That one is also beautiful.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael looks at the photo of him motorskying.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Do you know that the fans loved this pic?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Really?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: It&rsquo;s always like that when they see you in a strange situation.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I understand, the fans love to see me doing things I normally don&rsquo;t do&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Exactly, for example they adore to see you doing parasailing! Like you did in SA.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">At these words Michael starts speaking with enthusiasm:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yes! What a wonderful memory! You must publish the pictures we took that day! I want to do it again! It was a wonderful experience! I loved it so much that I wanted to do it four times in a row! It&rsquo;s flying, seeing the world from above&hellip;I love the water, but I can&rsquo;t bathe as often as I&rsquo;d like&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael stops and assumes a thoughtful expression. Then he goes on to the page of the maxi-shop:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Do you think I could get a little statue like that? &ndash; he asks shyly pointing at the History statuette they offer with some orders.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: We&rsquo;ll see&hellip;- Laughing</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Did you receive the collecting cards we sent you?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yes, but the kids that travel with me have gone all over them and they disappeared. It&rsquo;s always like that!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then he keeps turning the pages, his eyes stop on a photo of him with Diana Ross, then he sees a photo of him and Lisa Marie on a rollercoaster upside down.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I&rsquo;ve never seen this photo before! &ndash; Laughs &ndash; I like it!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then he keeps on turning until he gets to the fans pages where there&rsquo;s a photo of a half naked boy, it&rsquo;s a montage. Michael ROTFLHAOs and shows the picture to Bob.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: look!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">After a moment of mad laughing, he calms down.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I love the fans! I love to read their messages and their banners&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">At the end of the magazine there&rsquo;s a BW cover for the Elizabeth I love you TV broadcast.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: What is this?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: It&rsquo;s a cover that they can cut up and put on their tape of the broadcast. Do you know that the fans adore &lsquo;Elizabeth I love you&rsquo; the song?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Really?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: It has become a classic. There&rsquo;s so much emotion in that song, such intensity!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M- I had no idea that they liked it so much&hellip;I wrote it in Switzerland especially for that night, but I never knew what the public thought of it. When I finish one project I move on to the next, I can&rsquo;t wait, but I&rsquo;m happy you are telling me this, it&rsquo;s interesting, I never know what the fans think about what I do.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then Michael takes on a thoughtful expression and says to himself:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the fans loved it, interesting&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael is looking now at History magazine, at a picture with Marcel Marceau in NY 95.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: It&rsquo;s wonderful! I adore this version of Childhood, it&rsquo;s strange, nobody ever saw it&hellip;there are things like that which nobody will ever see&hellip;it was wonderful&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M, to Bob: We filmed everything, right?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Will you ever do this show for HBO one day?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: No, I don&rsquo;t think so, I worked so much to prepare that show, there was such a pressure, people pushing me to do this show no matter what! Then finally, the nature took its course and said, &ldquo;stop&rdquo;, she decided I shouldn&rsquo;t do that show&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Michael is still looking at History, when he sees a picture on Bob during the WMA in Monaco.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: OOHH! Sir! Look, it&rsquo;s you in Monaco! You are so well dressed! What a class, it&rsquo;s so chic!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Then M leans over to the BW guys and whispers:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: He loves Monaco, he loves champagne and caviar!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Every one laughs and the mood in that room is extraordinary, they have never seen Michael so relaxed&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: M, what do you think of BOTDF, are you satisfied with that album?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M, immediately: I&rsquo;m never satisfied with anything, if it was for me, no album would ever come out&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: What do you think of the remixes they did of your songs?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: The least I can say is that I don&rsquo;t like them&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like it that they come in and change my songs completely, but Sony says that the kids love remixes&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: That is not true! The kids don&rsquo;t love the remixes that much, especially those on BOTDF!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I knew it! I was sure!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Throwing a fist in the air, then he shakes his head sighing.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: What do you think of the BOTDF cover?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I like it!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: We always talk about the songs that the fans love and one they like most is On The Line.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">So Michael starts singing the song clapping his hands! At this extraordinary show, the guys are speechless for a moment. Seeing their reaction Michael smiles shyly.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Babyface has composed this title, but your interpretation is so inspired that the song takes on another kind of dimension.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Thank you very much, I love that song, did it come out as a single?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: No, it&rsquo;s just in the Ghosts box.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Sighing again.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: One more song hasn&rsquo;t released as single!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: One of your best performance was the Grammy 88.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Oh yes? You liked the slow version of TWYMMF? I always wanted to do that&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: But there&rsquo;s also something we didn&rsquo;t like, it&rsquo;s the broadcast version of the History show, honestly, the TV concert is not that good, it takes a lot away from the show, the sound is mediocre and also the editing&hellip;It&rsquo;s very deceiving!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: It&rsquo;s true, I was very disappointed by that&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t take care of it personally, I saw the final result on the last week. The concert was edited during the tour, I was so exhausted, then that I had to let other people do it in my place. But today I&rsquo;m disappointed, it&rsquo;s not good. I won&rsquo;t let that version come out for sale. I want to edit it all over again and I want to</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">add twenty minutes at the beginning to show the fans arriving in the stadium, I want to show the enthusiasm, the thrill of the public&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: How do you create your videos? Do you always have a lot of ideas?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yes, always. And also I&rsquo;m submitted interesting projects at times. But I don&rsquo;t always get to do the things I want. Some people push me to do things fast, they don&rsquo;t care about the result, so they don&rsquo;t care that the videos will look like everyone else&rsquo;s, they don&rsquo;t want to be creative. They are limited&hellip;I always wanted to do videos that were innovative, and I want to continue like that</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: That is your characteristic indeed.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yes, I want to do some videos like Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, new works, creative, innovative&hellip; But some people only want that I put myself in front of the camera, and when the lights go on they hope something magic will happen&hellip;just like that, without thinking, Well, it doesn&rsquo;t work that way&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">The BW guys say it&rsquo;s strange to see Michael so upset, it&rsquo;s the artist talking, any obstacle to his imagination and creative mind is not to be tolerated.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: What will you do next? A movie or a new album?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I WILL record a new album first. I have composed so many songs. Then I&rsquo;ll do a movie.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">After 45 minutes of chatting, it&rsquo;s time to take pictures. Bob asks M if he remembers the first time BW met with him?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Yes, it was on that island close to France&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Actually it was Tenerife, close to Morocco, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it&rsquo;s already too much for him to remember it was an island!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">Suddenly,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> M to Bob: Do you like caviar?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: I love it.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I think it&rsquo;s too salty for me&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M to BW </span><span class="cs43C038A">(while they take more photos):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Have you watched the Motown 40?</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">BW: Not yet</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: It was interesting&hellip; &ndash; in a low voice</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bob: The ratings were catastrophic, after Motown 25, how could they have done better? </span><span class="cs43C038A">They should have finished it there&hellip;</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: Motown 25 was the top. &ndash; </span><span class="cs43C038A">whispering.</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">After taking more photos, it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye. The guys thank Michael and exit the suite, waiting for the elevator. It arrives and the guys are ready to go in. Suddenly they see a figure approaching, it&rsquo;s Michael, he needs the elevator too, the guys move back to let him go first, but Michael says politely:</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: No! I don&rsquo;t want to steal your elevator!</span></p><p class="csF06CD379"><span class="cs43C038A">They insist, and Michael gets in the elevator, while the doors close Michael keeps thanking them and clapping his hands.</span></p></body>
