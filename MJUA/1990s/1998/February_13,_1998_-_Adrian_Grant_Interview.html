		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Adrian Grant Interview</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date confirmed in Adrian Grant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making HIStory&rdquo; book (&ldquo;Friday 13th February, unlucky for some, but not myself, I interviewed Michael for this book.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, Adrian Grant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Making HIStory&rdquo; book interview</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Adrian Grant: You have travelled to many countries all over the world. Can you tell me about your admiration for Brazil, and the experience that you had whilst filming the video &lsquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rsquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson: I love the Brazilian people, I feel for them in the same way I feel for the Indians and Africans. There&rsquo;s a lot of poverty in Brazil, and I remember going there for the first time kind of left my heart&hellip; (You know there&rsquo;s bits of my heart in different countries around the world in which I travel)... and I have a lot of heart for those people. Have you ever been to Brazil?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: No I haven&rsquo;t, but I hope to one day, especially for the Carnival!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: It&rsquo;s amazing. The people are so sweet, they were so happy to see me. You know they were overwhelmed with excitement, and I was happy to be there for them. I wish I could do more &ndash; I just feel so bad that I don&rsquo;t do enough, I really do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Why did you choose Spike Lee to direct that video?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: &lsquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us&rsquo; has an edge, and Spike Lee had approached me. It&rsquo;s a public awareness song, and that&rsquo;s what he is all about. It&rsquo;s a protest kind of song &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a racist song, it&rsquo;s an anti-racist song and I thought he was perfect for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG:You wrote a song called &lsquo;Money&rsquo;. Having been a millionaire sing you were a boy, how important is money to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I guess it gets things done...to fulfill some dreams you need to have financial backing. However I think everything starts with a thought, like if you plant a seed which then cultivates itself, everything comes out of that. I never really thought about it when I was little, I always felt that I was compelled to do the things I did, I really did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Do you not find it difficult to relate to the needs and the pain of the suffering when you seemingly have everything you could desire?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: No, no, not at all. Being a world traveller I&rsquo;m touched and moved by everything that happens, especially to children. It gets me emotionally sick, and I go through a lot of pain when I see that type of thing. I can&rsquo;t pretend as if I don&rsquo;t see it. It affects me very much. For some reason there&rsquo;s a certain part of my concert where I break down in every show and in that spot I get a certain thought &ndash; I think of the plight of the children and it gets me every time. I don&rsquo;t know why in that place, it&rsquo;s during &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Be There&rsquo;, the thoughts just come to me and I try hard to contain myself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: What is your favourite song on the HIStory album and why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: My favourite songs are &lsquo;Earth Song&rsquo;, &lsquo;Childhood&rsquo; and &lsquo;You Are Not Alone&rsquo; because I like songs with emotions and a message, and a sense of immortality. I like there to be some depth in the lyrics as well as a melodic simpleness that the whole world can sing them. That was my goal, to capture that on those songs and I think I came pretty close. Wherever we went on a tour, people just loved them, and I was pleased to have done that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Would you say there is a concurrent theme running throughout the HIStory album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: It&rsquo;s about people looking at their lives, and making something of themselves &ndash; creating a legacy so you can look back at what you have done. I always wanted that, and that&rsquo;s why I like working very hard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(We pause as Bob Jones, Vice President of MJJ Communications gives Michael some information. A few jokes are made at my expense, but we then turn to talk about The Annual Michael Jackson Day. Again, as in the past - Michael comments on how wonderful all of the performers are that take part.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: How did your collaboration with R. Kelly on &lsquo;You Are Not Alone&rsquo; arise?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: R. Kelly sent me this tape of the song and I liked what I heard. It had no harmonies and it had no modulations, so I told him he &lsquo;wrote a great song, is it OK if I just go in and I do what I think this song should have?&rsquo; He said &lsquo;sure&rsquo;, so I went in and produced it. I put a choir in the end and did a great modulation so the song had a sense of climax and structure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Why did you include your cover of the Beatles song &lsquo;Come Together&rsquo; on the HIStory album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I was coming home from church and my engineer was fooling around with that song, which I hadn&rsquo;t asked him to do, but when I heard it I said &lsquo;WOW! This is my favourite Beatles song.&rsquo; So I just went in and in one take started singing it. We kept it kind of raw and funky. It was just spontaneous , but I knew I wanted to do something with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: You broke many records during your successful &lsquo;HIStory Tour&rsquo;. Is it hard to get motivated for each show, after more than 30 years of performing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I usually come to the show not feeling like I really want to do it because of being overworked, but once I get there I feel the spirit of the entire audience before I even get on stage. And then the magic takes place &ndash; no matter how you feel, even dead sick and weary &ndash; suddenly you just go out and do it. The energy comes out of nowhere. It&rsquo;s like the Gods are blessing you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: What personal satisfaction did you gain from the tour?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: Seeing all the races together, which I love so much. All the colours in the audience loving one another, getting on with each other and enjoying the music &ndash; a unified field!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Would you say that your music is now written from a more personal viewpoint, compared to the pure disco of your earlier material?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I never categorise the music &rsquo;cause I never sit down and say I&rsquo;m gonna write a disco song, or pop or rock or... I just kind of write according to the emotion, according to what I&rsquo;m going through in the moment. I get caught up in the moment wherever the moment is, wherever the emotion is. I create out of that and I almost feel guilty of putting my name on the songs that I write because they are from another source. I&rsquo;m just a funnel through which they come, I really do believe that. They are from above. They choose me, I don&rsquo;t choose them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Blood On The Dance Floor is a very striking title. Is the song about AIDS?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: No it isn&rsquo;t, not at all. Actually I didn&rsquo;t create the title, my engineer (Bill Bottrell) thought of the title, which I thought was cool, so I wrote the song around the title. And then I made a mistake, and I apologised, but they didn&rsquo;t show it on TV. When I was in England - I hid in England at some time (1993), and Elton John let me use his house. He was so sweet and kind, and I thought I never thanked him. So I decided to dedicate a song to him, and that song was &lsquo;Blood On The Dance Floor&rsquo;. But after it came out, I said &lsquo;Why did I dedicate that one, of all the songs, it could have been &lsquo;You Are Not Alone&rsquo; etc&hellip;&rsquo; So I always thought that I wanted to apologise to him for that &ndash; it was just out of him being kind. He&rsquo;s a wonderful person.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(A call comes in regarding his son, Prince. It&rsquo;s his first birthday today, and Michael will soon have to be with him as he returns from a little shopping expedition.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Do you feel a connection with the late Princess Diana, given that many of your songs on the HIStory album talk about your personal torment and persecution from others?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: Yes I do, very much. I think I understood her. In the moments that we had,that were very intimate and personal, we talked on such subjects. I think it&rsquo;s a tragic, tragic loss. I feel that people like myself and other artists should carry the torch of what her mission was and I think I have that understanding &ndash; it&rsquo;s what I do, and am willing to do. I thought she was brilliant.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Do you feel that the song &lsquo;Tabloid Junkie&rsquo; highlights at all the tragic circumstances in which Princess Diana died?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: Yes, the tabloids are a bunch of trash. I think there should be a way to destroy them. We should create a big burning, like in stadiums around the world - pile them all together! You remember how they used to do disco records, and just create a burning, to make people aware. It&rsquo;s such an intrusion. It&rsquo;s a horrible thing. They hunt you, it&rsquo;s terrible. It creates such ugliness, they never think about how the person feels about what they write.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: When and how did the idea for the short film, &lsquo;Ghosts&rsquo;, arise?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: It started with the &lsquo;Addam&rsquo;s family&rsquo;, they wanted a theme song (&lsquo;Is It Scary&rsquo;) for their film, and I didn&rsquo;t want to do it. So eventually we got out of it. So I ended up making a short film. I love films, I love movies, and that&rsquo;s why my next mission is to make films. That&rsquo;s what I want the next chapter in my life to be &ndash; movies and records. There&rsquo;s no other place to go. I&rsquo;ll do film, records and direct. I&rsquo;ll also do complete directing myself, &rsquo;cause I love it very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: What type of films would you see yourself in?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: Everything, not just musical stuff but drama, pathos &ndash; I love it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Which people and events in world history have played a significant part in your own life and why?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I would say John F. Kennedy, because that smacks of my generation when I was little. I think he was America&rsquo;s greatest President. I saw some of the civil rights movement on television but I never experienced it personally, but that affected everybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: Throughout your career you have constantly taken your art form to another level. How do you see your live performances taking place in the future?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I don&rsquo;t wanna do any more live shows (World Tours), I don&rsquo;t think I will! I wanna spend the rest of my life doing records and films. I&rsquo;ll do some special shows here and there. You know I&rsquo;ve been doing it since I was five, I don&rsquo;t know if I wanna do it anymore &ndash; but I do love it very much. I wanna create for the next 100 years, and that&rsquo;s film work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AG: How would you like history to portray Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ: I think as someone who has been given the ability and talent to do what I do, to heighten the awareness of peace and love, and the plight of children worldwide on to a universal level. It&rsquo;s been created through song, dance and film &ndash; I guess that&rsquo;s my mission, and I&rsquo;m happy to have been chosen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Adrian Grant, author, &ldquo;Making HIStory&rdquo; book</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Friday 13th February, unlucky for some, but not myself, I interviewed Michael for this book. I was so very privileged that Michael should take the time to see me, for it was the first birthday of his son, Prince.</span></p></body>
