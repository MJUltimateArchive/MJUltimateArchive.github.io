Following a phalanx of security men and surrounded by an entourage, a veiled and robed Michael Jackson entered the hall. The King of Pop bought a leather Knucklehead jacket and some T-shirts at the souvenir stands, got into a Silly String melee with his companions, some vendors and the Stooge impersonators, and cajoled some his group into volunteering for one of the staged pie fights. A Jackson spokesman said the singer went to the convention because he is a longtime Stooges fan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">User chrisbcritter, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.66batman.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=43979#p43979"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The 1966 Batman Message Board&rdquo; user chrisbcritter (January 27, 2016)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200407014711/http://www.66batman.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=43979"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In August of 1998, a friend and I went to the one in Burbank&hellip; I got to participate in one of the pie fights with some real good Stooge &quot;impoisonatas&quot;, as well as meet Billy Barty and Bela Lugosi, Jr.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Best (O/T) part of the story: After the last pie fight, there was a flurry among the event coordinators: &quot;He&#39;s here! He&#39;s here! Clear the room! Clear the lobby!&quot; Everyone was ushered outside, and my friend and I grabbed our cameras. Out front a stretched Rolls-Royce pulled up and several people got out. In the midst of them, wearing a silver-gray metallic hooded boxing robe and shades, was... Michael Jackson. We followed him inside at a distance, and he and a bunch of kids went into the pie fight room. It was closed to the public, but they forgot to shut off one of the video monitors in the lobby so we got to see the same kind of pie fight I was in; this time starring the pseudo-Stooges and all the kids - but not Michael, who was just watching off-camera and laughing it up.</span></p></body>
