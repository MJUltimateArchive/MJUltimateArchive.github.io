I was at the Record Plant, and I was one of the chief engineers there, so they always put me on the tweaky sessions, on the ones that were difficult, or people were hard to work with, or things like that, so Rose Mann-Cherney, she--Rose was booking the Record Plant, and she was running, booking, and part owner of the Record Plant. And she put me on a session with Michael, where Michael was going to test out engineers. He was looking for an engineer, he was looking for somebody to work with... Rose put me on the session as a second engineer, so basically I come with the room. I make sure you have a smooth session no matter what. So this was the--maybe the second or third time I worked with Michael as a second engineer. I worked with him a few years before that with Eddie Delana. So Michael explained to me, he says, &quot;We&#39;re gonna check out some of these guys&quot;--I&#39;m paraphrasing, I can&#39;t remember exactly what he said, but basically, &quot;We&#39;re gonna check out some of these guys, we&#39;re gonna go through the motions. I&#39;m gonna check out these engineers.&quot; I said, &quot;Great, what am I gonna do?&quot; So he kinda had a schedule, these guys kinda coming in, he was gonna meet them. He was gonna work with them for a second, he was gonna let them go. And that&#39;s what we did. So, first guy came in, and it&#39;s good that I can&#39;t remember their names, &#39;cause they would be embarrassed with the stories. But these were guys who had Grammys, and things like that. And so, the first cat came in. Michael sat down at the chair, and Michael just was throwing questions and production things at the guy. He was trying to figure out the level of sophistication of technology, &#39;cause Michael really wants someone to perform in the room. And so he asked him to do something very unusual. Now Michael, one of the main things Michael does, is to comp vocal tracks, so Michael will sing a bunch of tracks and we&#39;ll construct a vocal take out of many takes. And so he asked this engineer to do it in a very unusual way on the SSL console. He said, &quot;I want to comp a vocal on the console&quot;, and that was very unusual. I knew that right away, that Michael was throwing this guy a curve ball. He was just testing him, so here&#39;s a test, dude! Sink or swim! And so the dude was already sort of like going, &quot;Oh, damn&quot;. [laughs] I could see him going, &quot;Ohhh, ok&quot;. So he was sorta poking at it, and then ten seconds later, nothing was happening, so the guy was sort of stuck. Well, just by the mere nature of why I was there, working as a second engineer, I stepped over the guy&#39;s shoulders and I hit the correct buttons and got him going. And then he sort of got moving again with Michael, practicing some button switches for the comp. And then the guy got stuck again, I leaned over and hit the correct buttons. So I was sort of keeping the session going, even though Michael was sort of testing this guy. I couldn&#39;t help it, it&#39;s kinda what we do, you know? So the guy got out of his chair and said, &quot;You do it&quot;... And the guy did the right thing, because he knows that there&#39;s somewhat of a code, I guess, you can call it a code--no matter what happens, the session doesn&#39;t stop. Michael is the point. So when two engineers are in a room, whoever can do it is gonna do it. So he naturally got up out of the chair and said, &quot;You do it&quot;, and that would naturally happen because we&#39;re trying to get a session going for Michael Jackson, and that was sort of what was--and so the guy was correct in his--it was the astute thing to do. But it wasn&#39;t what Michael wanted, obviously. So they worked a little more and they had a nice conversation, and Michael is always very gracious and a very sweet man, and he sent him on his way. And that was the day for that. That took a few hours to get through. And I thought that was very interesting for me, as an engineer, in the room. So Michael and I parted ways for that day. We came back the next day, and there was a new guy. And this happened three times, but the other one was kinda like this one. This is kind of a similar story. So another guy came in, had the exact same chat, but this time Michael threw a different technological issue on him, but this was easier. And this was comping on this Sony recorder, it&#39;s called a 3348, and has all these buttons--a million buttons on it, and of course, I was very fluid on it. So the guy was sitting down and he kinda should&#39;ve been fluid on it I thought, and he was kind of, same thing, kind of not--you know, Michael&#39;s very *clap, clap, snap, snap* Michael&#39;s very--you can tell that it&#39;s--the thing has gotta be snappy. I mean, Michael is not--you gotta go fast [laughs]. As fast as Michael is the whole idea. So the second engineer was trying to get through it, and I kept leaning over, hitting the right buttons, and that guy, of course, being the astute engineer that he was, did the exact same thing. Got out of his chair and said, &quot;You do it&quot;. So I got out of the chair and I started comping with Michael, and so Michael&#39;s looking at me, like, &quot;Dude&quot;. I was like, &quot;Oh, well, you know&quot;. So the same thing, he finishes the conversation with that man. Three or four days later, after one more guy--we only tested three guys--it was kinda the same deal. Michael looked at me and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you be my engineer?&quot; And I said, &quot;Yeah&quot;. [laughs] &quot;Yeah! I&#39;m ready, let&#39;s do this, let&#39;s work Michael, I want to get to it.&quot; And he&#39;s going, &quot;Great&quot;. And that was it. The next day, some assistant from some attorney plopped a 30-page contract in front of me, and I signed it, and that was it. The next day I was working in the studio with MJ.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Now at this point... as far as studio stuff, were you guys working on digital yet, or was it still tape?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">It was digital tapes, so it was both. Yeah, it was the Sony 3348, that was Michael&#39;s favorite machine. And believe it or not, it was 48 tracks on half-inch, and it was a gorgeous-sounding machine. They probably weigh about 800 pounds. Back in the day, they probably cost $150,000.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, those things are pretty massive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DeVillar: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, you can&#39;t </span><span class="cs43C038A">give</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &#39;em away now. You can&#39;t give &#39;em away. They&#39;re just throwing &#39;em in the ocean now, at this point. So yeah, that was Michael&#39;s preferred format. We were doing a little bit of Pro-Tool-ing, but back then, we were, let&#39;s say, transferring. We were taking stuff off of the Sony machine, putting it into Pro Tools, doing our edits, and going back to the Sony machine, and that was kind of Michael&#39;s M.O. (modus operandi) back then. He wasn&#39;t sold on staying in Pro Tools totally yet.</span></p></body>
