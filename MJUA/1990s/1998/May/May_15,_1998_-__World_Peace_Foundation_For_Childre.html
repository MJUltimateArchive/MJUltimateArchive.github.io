On October 11th, I am very excited to be organizing and performing the first of what I hope will be a series of concert appearances to benefit the World For Peace Foundation for Children. In 1985, I joined with many others in the music industry to create We Are The World, a song which led to the USA For Africa concert. That event brought millions of dollars and aid to hungry families and children throughout Africa and the United States. Following that experience, it was my dream to do a worldwide series of concerts which would raise funds to bring aid to suffering people around the Globe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, with the help of many friends, we are taking the first steps toward realizing that dream. I am delighted to be working with my good friend, Luciano Pavarotti, my lovely friend, Elizabeth Taylor, to perform the first of these concerts in Korea, a country I have grown to love very, very much. We are also working to have a very special performance in the demilitarised zone which separates North and South Korea, an event which was never been done before. Elizabeth Taylor has supported this endeavour since its inception, and I&rsquo;m very excited that she will be joining me at this very important event. It is my sincere hope that, through my efforts and through the support of JL Communications and the Korean Peace Foundation for Children, we can bring an end to famine in this troubled part of the world. In the years ahead, it is my intention to create similar events.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1430445/michael-jackson-to-start-global-childrens-charity-schedules-korean-benefit-concert/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MTV News&rdquo; (May 15, 1998)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200419184501/http://www.mtv.com/news/1430445/michael-jackson-to-start-global-childrens-charity-schedules-korean-benefit-concert/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson unveiled plans today to found an international charity entitled the World Peace Foundation for Children, and will organize a series of concerts to benefit the new organization.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has scheduled the first concert for October 11, 1998, in Seoul, South Korea, with the proceeds to aid the Korean Peace Foundation for Children, the first subsidiary group to be formed as part of the WPFC.
