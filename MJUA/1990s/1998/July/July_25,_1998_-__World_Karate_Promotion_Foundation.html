Thank you very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20090709jk.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Daikaku Chodoin, founder, The Japan Times (July 9, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100724172216/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20090709jk.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Daikaku Chodoin, 68, is the founder and president of the United World Karate Association which was then changed to the United World Karate Federation in 2012, which combines all five iemoto (the traditional branches of the martial art) with an estimated 50 million practitioners around the world. A kyuudan (9th degree black belt) of Goju-ryu, one of Okinawa&rsquo;s &ldquo;hard-soft&rdquo; karate styles, Chodoin is a fearless fighter who thrives on going to battle both on and off the dojo floor. His winning streak began in his 20s: He first struck gold with shipbuilding and later made a killing with real estate and stocks. He has used his vast fortune to fight racial discrimination and supported revolutionary movements in Africa, South America and the Middle East. In 1985 Chodoin established the World Black Congress in order to unite Africans and that same year he created the Society of International Outer Space Law to draw up a legal framework that would give all nations equal right to space. Chodoin&rsquo;s desire to heal and save the world struck a chord with Michael Jackson: Since their first meeting in 1997, The King of Pop and the King of karate got along royally. In 1998, Chodoin presented Michael with the Honorary Chairmanship of the United World Karate Association and a godan (fifth degree) black belt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once you learn how to keep secrets, you will hear many. &ldquo;I arranged everything for Michael&rsquo;s visit. When his plane landed, we had a car drive up to it on the tarmac and rode straight into Tokyo. He stayed in a hotel but was usually at my office. We talked and did karate for three days. Nobody knew he was here, and he loved this fact.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A phone call should not be longer than 10 seconds. &ldquo;That is enough time to say hi, thinking of you, me too, great, bye, bye. Michael has been calling me for 13 years, a couple of times a year. I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s gone. We won&rsquo;t be talking anymore, but we&rsquo;re still connected.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is rich people&rsquo;s duty to support artists. &ldquo;Michael was a genius in art and business. When he said he was in a jam, I felt like when you stand by a Shinto shrine, happy to throw money into the altar. For me, he was a messenger of the universe. I gave him about 20 million dollars in seven installments, and it never occurred to me that I would ever see that money again. My contribution was a fraction of what others gave him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Karate, like other sports, eliminates discrimination. &ldquo;Regardless of color, race or gender, all people who do karate respect each other&rsquo;s strength and ability. Michael asked me to show him some karate moves. He could do them immediately, totally perfectly. He could have been a brilliant athlete. I asked Michael to help me put karate into the Olympics Games. He talked to International Olympic Committee chairman, Juan Antonio Samaranch and we were told that if we could unite all the sects of the martial art, karate had a chance to be an Olympic sport. Hopefully 2016 will be our year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.ibssa.org/index.php?article_id=547"><span class="cs8567212B">International Bodyguard and Security Services Association (IBSSA) (2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson was a Knight of Malta, as clearly visible in the picture that he wore the crowned Maltese cross. The photo was taken when he received the Honorary 5th dan in Karate during a high-level event in Tokyo, in 1998, where Mr. Jackson was honorary guest, and the protocol event was organised for about 1000 guests. This significant event - attended by the prime group of the Japanese social, economic and political life &ndash; was organised for celebrating the creation of World Karate Promotion Foundation (WKPF). WKPF was established by a considerable number of businessmen with the aim of turning Karate, the Japanese national sport, to olympic sport.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The guests of honour of the opening ceremony of the campaign were: Michael Jackson and George Popper, who was this time the Executive President of WKPF and also of IBSSA, and Secretary General of the European Karate Federation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/singer-michael-jackson-attends-the-98-kick-boxing-champion-news-photo/88778706"><span class="cs8567212B">Getty Images&rsquo; &ldquo;Sankei Archive&rdquo; photo listing</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200419181234/https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/singer-michael-jackson-attends-the-98-kick-boxing-champion-news-photo/88778706"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Singer Michael Jackson attends the &#39;98 Kick Boxing Champion Carnival All Stars press conference on July 25, 1998 in Tokyo, Japan.</span></p></body>
