In a statement released shortly afterwards Vice President of communications Bob Jones said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael Jackson is suffering from virus type symptoms and he has decided to cancel the show. He had planned to perform but it is a nausea-type virus and on the advice of his physicians it was decided to cancel. Obviously he is very upset.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael loves to perform and is in heaven when he is performing for his fans. He is happiest on stage giving his all. This is not a decision we are happy to announce.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few days later from the Dorchester Hotel Michael threw a white napkin from his balcony for his fans with a message to them. It read:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I love you all very much. I&rsquo;m feeling better now. Thank you for your compassion. MJ&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later he had to leave a Science Museum quickly after a hoax bomb call.</span></p></body>
