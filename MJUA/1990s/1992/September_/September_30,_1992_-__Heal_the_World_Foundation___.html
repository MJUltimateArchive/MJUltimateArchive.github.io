Thousands of Romanians turned out to try to catch a glimpse of Michael Jackson, in Bucharest to give a concert Thursday night as part of his European tour. The pop superstar joined Romanian President Ion Iliescu Wednesday at the opening of a playground for orphans. Jackson was late for the appearance and the president was left cooling his heels for nearly an hour until he showed. The playground was financed by Jackson&#39;s Heal the World Charity. &#39;We must heal each other and ourselves...and celebrate the joy of giving,&#39; Jackson told an audience of Romanian VIPs and Western journalists. He is the biggest star to visit the nation since the bloody revolution three years ago and even Premier Theodor Stolojan took time off from his busy schedule to greet him. &#39;This is an extraordinary event for Romania. You have brought a ray of light to the country,&#39; the premier said, although he seemed somewhat amused by the singer&#39;s costume — a military-style black jacket, black jeans, black hat, sunglasses, and plenty of makeup.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/485111145/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Observer&rdquo; (October 3, 1992)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190919163258/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/485111145/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.deseret.com/1992/10/9/19009572/romanians-forget-plight-for-a-night-with-superstar"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror with full transcript</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190919163350/https://www.deseret.com/1992/10/9/19009572/romanians-forget-plight-for-a-night-with-superstar"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Prime Minister Teodor Stolojan, who has kept Romania on an even keel for the past year, was another VIP.

That was the furthest Playdale had ever been to build a playground, the man did not say who wanted the playground to be built, so the designers and installers got to work, they built the playground in the factories and sent it in a massive lorry to Romania, six people went along too, when they arrived in Bucharest, they discovered that MICHAEL JACKSON was the mystery client, and he wanted the playground for his Michael Jackson &lsquo;Heal the World&rsquo; foundation.

Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Prime Minister. These children are as dear to me as all the children of the world. Today, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to see the face of transformation and civilization. A moment like this means healing the world. We must heal the world and ourselves. We have to weave our life like a web, because we are part of this web. Out of negligence, we have contaminated and polluted our planet and, in exchange, we hurt ourselves. In the life songs of ages is the dance of our blood. The environment is an extension of our body and it gives the pulse of love, is the orchestra of universe&rsquo;s symphony. It is music&rsquo;s territory and enables us to rediscover our souls. Let&rsquo;s rejoice together in love today, unity and conciliation. Let&rsquo;s heal everybody and, thus, heal ourselves. Let us make a covenant with life and let us celebrate with joy a new world... and healed. Thank you... especially, to all the children of the world. I love you all. Thank you so much..
