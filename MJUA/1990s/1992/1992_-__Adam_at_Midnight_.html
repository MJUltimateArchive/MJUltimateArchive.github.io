Greg was commissioned by a producer in Los Angeles to create a painting as pre-production art for a film titled &quot;Adam at Midnight&quot;. Greg always does multiple versions of his designs before he decides which one he will paint. You can see the final painting that was created above.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The screenplay was a wonderful story which was set in New Orleans and Michael Jackson was set to play the lead part as a male Cinderella type character. The producer used the final painting to get the financial backing for the film in which Michael would be the Star. Unfortunately the film was never made.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://variety.com/1993/film/news/jacko-no-shows-2-cos-104709/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Variety&rdquo; (March 8, 1993)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190602195953/https://variety.com/1993/film/news/jacko-no-shows-2-cos-104709/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mysterious Michael Jackson has started more movie companies than movies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although nothing has materialized yet from his Nation Films deal with Sony Corp.&rsquo;s Columbia Pictures, Jackson has announced his second film production company, dubbed Michael Jackson Prods.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The move reportedly caught Nation Films by surprise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We know nothing about it,&rdquo; a Sony spokesman said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sources confirmed Nation Films production exex Melissa Bachrach and recently appointed Lawrence Rudolph were unaware of the new company. Both refused to comment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve Chabre, president and CEO of Jackson&rsquo;s companies, said there is &ldquo;absolutely not&rdquo; a problem with the Columbia Pictures deal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 34-year-old superstar launched MJP to have &ldquo;an opportunity to develop and produce feature films with strong messages consistent with Michael&rsquo;s philosophy and reflective of (Jackson&rsquo;s non-profit) Heal the World Foundation,&rdquo; Chabre said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s two features in development at Nation Films &ndash;&ldquo;Midknight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Adam at Midnight&rdquo;&ndash; also will reflect his &ldquo;philosophy,&rdquo; Chabre noted. However, that deal was &ldquo;established as a more traditional, commercial Hollywood entity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The new non-studio venture &ldquo;is a little more international and more philosophically oriented,&rdquo; Chabre said. &ldquo;This is more (for) message movies &hellip; with a strong bent toward international audiences.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The new venture has two anonymous foreign investors.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson may have more control of pix at MJP. A news release said Jackson will both script and perform in some of the films.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael will probably take a producer credit, but we haven&rsquo;t gotten that far yet,&rdquo; Chabre said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little embryonic just to make this announcement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJP budgets will depend on scripts, Chabre said. &ldquo;The scripts really run the gamut. It&rsquo;s really a range. We&rsquo;re not gearing to blockbusters, nor to advanced home movies.&rdquo; He said Jackson will only review scripts &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s something we think is good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whether Jackson will appear in the Nation Films pix before announcing an MJP project remains unclear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Reverse Cinderella musical &ldquo;Adam at Midnight&rdquo; is in development with Francis Ford Coppola&rsquo;s Zoetrope Prods. Coppola directed Jackson in the Disneyland short &ldquo;Captain Eo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I believe passionately in the power of mass entertainment and have seen how, with positive messages, it can help alleviate problems we face, especially the suffering of the world&rsquo;s children,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;MJP will enjoy a rare degree of independent integrity allowing us to produce the kind of commercial films we believe can achieve some good in this troubled world.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
