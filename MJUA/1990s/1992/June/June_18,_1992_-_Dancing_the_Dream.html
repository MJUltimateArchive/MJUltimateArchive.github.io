It was more autobiographical than Moonwalk, which I did with Mrs. Onassis. It wasn&rsquo;t full of gossip and scandal and all that trash that people write, so I don&rsquo;t think people paid much attention to it, but it came from my heart. It was essays, thoughts and things that I&rsquo;ve thought about while on tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Longer Interview with Michael on this book</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://mjultimatearchive.github.io/MJUA/1990s/1992/June/June_27,_1992_-_Munich,_Germany_(Dangerous_World_T.html"><span class="cs8567212B">https://mjultimatearchive.github.io/MJUA/1990s/1992/June/June_27,_1992_-_Munich,_Germany_(Dangerous_World_T.html</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Deepak Chopra, Michael&rsquo;s meditation guru, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-tribute-to-my-friend-mi_b_221268"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Huffington Post&rdquo; (July 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (archived)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The closest we ever became, perhaps, was when Michael needed a book to sell primarily as a concert souvenir. It would contain pictures for his fans but there would also be a text consisting of short fables. I sat with him for hours while he dreamily wove Aesop-like tales about animals, mixed with words about music and his love of all things musical. This project became </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dancing the Dream</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> after I pulled the text together for him, acting strictly as a friend. It was this time together that convinced me of the modus vivendi Michael had devised for himself: to counter the tidal wave of stress that accompanies mega-stardom, he built a private retreat in a fantasy world where pink clouds veiled inner anguish and Peter Pan was a hero, not a pathology.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19920823-1992-08-23-9208230182-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Press&rdquo; interview (August 23, 1992)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190705184310/https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19920823-1992-08-23-9208230182-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">):</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Vanishing backstage to quick-change from a black cat suit with a gold codpiece to a white spacesuit, the Barnum &amp; Bailey of Pop prepared to unleash the evening&#39;s grand finale.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lowering onto his head a Plexiglas helmet, The Thriller stepped behind a giant box on the stage marked &quot;Danger,&quot; strapped a jet pack onto his back and, with an impish grin, blasted 200 feet into the air (some say it was a stunt double), flying above Munich&#39;s Olympic Stadium like his storybook idol, Peter Pan. The crowd gaped in wonderment.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Ladies and gentleman,&quot; an announcer deadpanned, &rdquo;Michael Jackson has just left the stadium!&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Twenty minutes later, according to an emissary authorized to sit with the Gloved One, the 33-year-old legend sat benignly in his hotel suite, serene as Buddha, sipping a Pepsi, bare-handedly thumbing through an illustrated guide to Munich - just one stop on his current 37-city European tour promoting the multi-platinum &quot;Dangerous.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">The surging pulse of Jackson&#39;s stage persona was suddenly replaced by the alter personality - the childlike, but not childish, megastar who treasures his inner child above all else.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Peter Pan,&quot; Jackson mused that night to one of his entourage, &quot;asks us to fly, to become boundless. He dares us to accomplish the impossible, to escape the prison of mediocrity and dream the impossible dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s dream of healing the world through song and dance surfaces in the just-published &quot;Dancing the Dream,&quot; a fanciful collection of poems, reflections and photographs that champions kids, endangered species, the homeless, AIDS victims and planet Earth, edited by Doubleday&#39;s ace, Jacqueline Onassis, who had persuaded Jackson to write his 1988 best-selling autobiography, &quot;Moonwalk.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The book,&quot; explains Jackson in his only interview to publicize the 150-page scrapbook, &quot;is just a verbal expression of what I usually express through my music and my dance.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Does Jackson worry about composing hit songs? &quot;I do not feel pressure when I produce a song,&quot; insists the crafty businessman, who purchased the Beatles catalogue for $47.6 million in 1985, who landed $15 million from Pepsi in 1986 for two commercials, and who last year signed a $1 billion multimedia deal with Sony.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I compose a song,&quot; he says confidently, &quot;I know it&#39;s going to be a hit,&quot; later changing the word &quot;know&quot; to &quot;hope,&quot; lest he be considered arrogant. Nobody could blame him.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We conservatively estimate Jackson to be worth over $200 million, and every year for five years he has earned $60 million pre-tax, pre-expense,&quot; says Forbes magazine editor Peter Nukem. &quot;He could be worth another $50 million easily, but he blows a lot of money.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Indeed, ensconced in the Neverland Valley Ranch - his $35 million, 2,700-acre estate in Santa Ynez, Calif., Jackson, according to former ranch manager Mark Quinday, spends $300,000 a year on flower bulbs, $27,000 a month on long-distance phone calls and $28.50 an hour for someone to change the Pampers of the chimps, who have their own room. Not to mention 30 full-time gardeners and 40 people in security.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Within this cloister, says Quinday, the Disneyland-aholic romps on a ferris wheel, an octopus ride, a merry-go-round; he watches cartoons around the clock in a 100-seat movie theater; curates his very own museum, which includes portraits of George Washington, Napoleon and Albert Einstein; and orders his cook to create special dishes like &quot;Snow White&#39;s Tomato Soup,&quot; &quot;Dopey&#39;s Spinach and Yogurt&quot; and &quot;Bashful&#39;s Carrot Soup&quot; - flights of fancy never allowed him as a child.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">One worries for Jackson, who must battle the crushing pressures of cult fame as he heals the &quot;festering wounds&quot; of child abuse, as he describes them in &quot;Dancing the Dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">In an essay titled &quot;Once We Were There,&quot; Jackson poignantly writes, &quot;That lonely child still clutching his toy, has made his peace. ... The child has grown to weave his magic, left behind his life of sorrow, once so tragic.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">One wishes it so.</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="cs31D24DEE">[Interview]:</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. I like that you care, drawing attention in your new book &quot;Dancing the Dream&quot; to &quot;a child crying in Ethiopia, a sea gull struggling pathetically in an oil spill, a teenage soldier trembling with terror ...&quot; Do you think we&#39;ve become numb to all this?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;No, I don&#39;t think we have become numb to these tragedies. We are seeing a worldwide resurgence and restoration of basic human values and concern for the sacredness of all life on our planet.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. Your book is filled with an old soul&#39;s wisdom about life. Do you think of yourself as a philosopher?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I don&#39;t think of myself as a philosopher. I think I have a purpose, as does everyone else on Earth. To find that purpose and to live to express it is to ignite the spark of divinity within us.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. You always say dreaming is so important. Have you realized all your dreams?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;No. I haven&#39;t. Without dreams there is no creativity. The creative urge in us comes from discontent - a divine discontent that seeks to change, to transform, to fill the world with more magic. My priority in life is to make a difference, to tread unfamiliar, uncharted territory and to leave some trails behind.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. What do you like about kids and how do they revive you when you feel burdened?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;Children are innocent and they are non-judgmental. They revive me, because they help me find my own inner child, without whom I would be lost. From children we can learn to love, to forgive, to create anew in everything and to heal the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. When you&#39;re alone, do you feel lonely or contented?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I know how to experience solitude. Loneliness can be a harsh experience, but solitude is love and consciousness with all of life.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. You often speak of God and spirituality, and you were reared as a Jehovah&#39;s Witness. Do you consider yourself a religious person today?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I don&#39;t consider myself religious in the sense of subscribing to a particular dogma. I would consider myself spiritual - in that I believe there is a domain of awareness in which we can experience our universality. I read all kinds of religious literature, because I believe there is truth in all of them.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. In your book&#39;s essay &quot;Trust,&quot; you write: &quot;We think separating ourselves from others will protect us, but that doesn&#39;t work. It leaves us feeling alone and unloved.&quot; Do you feel imprisoned by your fame?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;Yes. Fame can be imprisoning. But the best part of being Michael Jackson is that I know I can interact with millions of people; and in that interaction we exchange something.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. Which is ...</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;Love. It is exhilarating. It is magic.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. I bet you could have been a great ballet dancer. Your mother once said you could imitate almost any dance move by the time you were 5. When you&#39;re dancing onstage, how does it feel and how hard do you work at it?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I dance to express my bliss. I do not strain at practice when I&#39;m dancing. I just feel that the dance is dancing itself through me. I&#39;m an instrument for the expression of ecstasy.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. Give us a few secrets: What do you eat, how do you exercise?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;My life is not constrained by special diets or exercise routines! I have fun with my friends or by myself. I like to see movies, read books, dance - and sometimes do nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. You write so much about animals. What can we all learn from them?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;Animals do not kill out of cruelty, greed or jealousy. And most do not kill their own kind. We are the only animals that plunder and destroy the Earth! But we are learning, and it is not too late.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. Speaking of animals, after the sexy, violent &quot;panther&quot; section of &quot;Black or White&quot; created so much controversy, amateur psychologists speculated that you were letting off tremendous feelings of anger about ...</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;Anger and rage are the prelude to a shift in consciousness. Unless we feel rage at some of the inequities and injustices of our society, there is no hope for transformation.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. Your videos are state-of-the-art, like a mini-motion picture. Would you like to make feature-length films?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I&#39;m going to produce and direct many feature films; movies that bring out the magic of life - that entertain but also make people think.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. In the meantime, when you&#39;re composing songs for your next album, do the words come first or the music?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I first hear the music and feel the dance, and then the words come spontaneously.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q. In your essay &quot;On Children of the World,&quot; you say so many children have had their childhoods stolen from them. As a child star, did you feel that way?</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. &quot;I certainly did not have a routine childhood. But the magic was always there.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">dancing the dream</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Consciousness expresses itself through creation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This world we live in is the dance of the creator.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dancers come and go in the twinkling of an eye but the dance lives on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On many an occasion when I&#39;m dancing, I&#39;ve felt touched by something sacred.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In those moments, I&#39;ve felt my spirit soar and become one with everything that exists.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I become the stars and the moon.

With one hand shielding my eyes, I made out a falcon soaring on the currents of hot swirling air. Higher and higher it spiraled, until with one unearthly shriek, it disappeared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All at once I felt left behind. &quot;Why did you grow wings without me?&quot; I mourned. Then my spirit said, &quot;The falcon&#39;s way is not the only way. Your thoughts are as free as any bird.&quot; So I shut my eyes and my spirit took off, spiraling as high as the falcon and then beyond, so that I was looking down over the whole earth. But something was wrong. Why did I feel so cold and alone?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You grew wings without me,&quot; my heart said. &quot;What good is freedom without love?&quot; So I went quietly to the bed of a sick child and sang him a lullaby. He fell asleep smiling, and my heart took off, joining my spirit as it circled over the earth. I was free and loving, but still something was wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You grew wings without me,&quot; my body said. &quot;Your flights are only imagination.&quot; So I looked into books that I had ignored before and read about saints in every age who actually flew. In India, Persia, China, and Spain (even in Los Angeles!), the power of spirit has reached, not just into the heart, but into every cell of the body. &quot;As if carried aloft by a great eagle,&quot; Saint Teresa said, &quot;my ecstasy lifted me into the air.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I began to believe in this amazing feat, and for the first time, I didn&#39;t feel left behind. I was the falcon and the child and the saint. In my eyes their lives became sacred, and the truth came home: When all life is seen as divine, everyone grows wings.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">DANCE OF life</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I cannot escape the moon. Its soft beams push aside the curtains at night. I don&#39;t even have to see it -- a cool blue energy falls across my bed and I am up. I race down the dark hall and swing open the door, not to leave home but to go back into it. &quot;Moon, I&#39;m here!&quot; I shout.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good,&quot; she replies. &quot;Now give us a little dance.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But my body has started moving long before she says anything. When did it start? I can&#39;t remember&mdash;my body has always been moving. Since childhood I have reacted to the moon this way, as her favorite lunatic, and not just hers. The stars draw me near, close enough so that I see through their twinkling act. They&#39;re dancing, too, doing a soft molecular jiggle that makes my carbon atoms jump in time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With my arms flung wide, I head for the sea, which brings out another dance in me. Moon dancing is slow inside, and soft as blue shadows on the lawn. When the surf booms, I hear the heart of the earth, and the tempo picks up. I feel the dolphins leaping in the white foam, trying to fly, and almost flying when the waves curl high to the heavens. Their tails leave arcs of light as plankton glow in the waves. A school of minnows rises up, flashing silver in the moonlight like a new constellation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; the sea says, &quot;Now we&#39;re gathering a crowd.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I run along the beach, catching waves with one foot and dodging them with the other. I hear faint popping sounds&mdash;a hundred panicky sand crabs are ducking into their holes, just in case. But I&#39;m racing now, sometimes on my toes, sometimes running flat-out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I throw my head back and a swirling nebula says, &quot;Fast now, twirl!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Grinning, ducking my head for balance, I start to spin as wildly as I can. This is my favorite dance, because it contains a secret. The faster I twirl, the more I am still inside. My dance is all motion without, all silence within. As much as I love to make music, it&#39;s the unheard music that never dies. And silence is my real dance, though it never moves. It stands aside, my choreographer of grace, and blesses each finger and toe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I have forgotten the moon now and the sea and the dolphins, but I am in their joy more than ever. As far away as a star, as near as a grain of sand, the presence rises, shimmering with light. I could be in it forever, it is so loving and warm. But touch it once, and light shoots forth from the stillness. It quivers and thrills me, and I know my fate is to show others that this silence, this light, this blessing is my dance. I take this gift only to give it again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Quick, give!&quot; says the light.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As never before, I try to obey, inventing new steps, new gestures of joy. All at once I sense where I am, running back up the hill. The light in my bedroom is on. Seeing it brings me back down. I begin to feel my pounding heart, the drowsiness in my arms, the warm blood in my legs. My cells want to dance slower. &quot;Can we walk a little?&quot; they ask. &quot;It&#39;s been kind of wild.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure.&quot; I laugh, slowing to an easy amble.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I turn the doorknob, panting lightly, glad to be tired. Crawling back into bed, I remember something that I always wonder at. They say that some of the stars that we see overhead aren&#39;t really there. Their light takes millions of years to reach us, and all we are doing is looking into the past, into a bygone moment when those stars could still shine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what does a star do after it quits shining?&quot; I ask myself. &quot;Maybe it dies.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, no,&quot; a voice in my head says. &quot;A star can never die. It just turns into a smile and melts back into the cosmic music, the dance of life.&quot; I like that thought, the last one I have before my eyes close. With a smile, I melt back into the music myself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">WHEN babies SMILE</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When dreamers dream and kiss their lover</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And rainbows weave and splash their color</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those are moments so gloriously alive</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We take the plunge, take the dive</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Into the abyss</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We are suspended awhile</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those are moments when babies smile</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those are moments when fate is unsealed</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nothing is impossible and we are healed</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We can soar, we can fly</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Walk on fire, navigate the sky</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the light of a glittering star</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There&#39;s no distance, nothing is far</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those are moments of innocent guile</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the glow</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We are suspended awhile</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those are moments when babies smile</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">are moments when the heart is tender</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When seascapes gleam in magnificent splendor</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the laughter of Heaven reverberates the Earth</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we are renewed in a new birth</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a timeless Eternity</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the angels&#39;

MARCH</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A curious fact about elephants is this: In order to survive, they mustn&#39;t fall down. Every other animal can stumble and get back up again. But an elephant always stands up, even to sleep. If one of the herd slips and falls, it is helpless. It lies on its side, a prisoner of its own weight. Although the other elephants will press close around it in distress and try to lift it up again, there isn&#39;t usually much they can do. With slow heaving breaths, the fallen elephant dies. The others stand vigil, then slowly move on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is what I learned from nature books, but I wonder if they are right. Isn&#39;t there another reason why elephants can&#39;t fall down? Perhaps they have decided not to. Not to fall down is their mission. As the wisest and most patient of the animals, they made a pact -- I imagine it was eons ago, when the ice ages were ending. Moving in great herds across the face of the earth, the elephants first spied tiny men prowling the tall grasses with their flint spears.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What fear and anger this creature has,&quot; the elephants thought. &quot;But he is going to inherit the earth. We are wise enough to see that. Let us set an example for him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then the elephants put their grizzled heads together and pondered. What kind of example could they show to man? They could show him that their power was much greater that his, for that was certainly true. They could display their anger before him, which was terrible enough to uproot whole forests. Or they could lord it over man through fear, trampling his fields and crushing his huts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In moments of great frustration, wild elephants will do all of these things, but as a group, putting their heads together, they decided that man would learn best from a kinder message.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Let us show him our reverence for life,&quot; they said. And from that day on, elephants have been silent, patient, peaceful creatures. They let men ride them and harness them like slaves. They permit children to laugh at their tricks in the circus, exiled from the great African plains where they once lived as lords.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But the elephants&#39; most important message is in their movement. For they know that to live is to move. Dawn after dawn, age after age, the herds march on, one great mass of life that never falls down, an unstoppable force of peace.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Innocent animals, they do not suspect that after all this time, they will fall from a bullet by the thousands. They will lie in the dust, mutilated by our shameless greed. The great males fall first, so that their tusks can be made into trinkets. Then the females fall, so that men may have trophies. The babies run screaming from the smell of their own mothers&#39; blood, but it does them no good to run from the guns. Silently, with no one to nurse them, they will die, too, and all their bones bleach in the sun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the midst of so much death, the elephants could just give up. All they have to do is drop to the ground. That is enough. They don&#39;t need a bullet: Nature has given them the dignity to lie down and find their rest. But they remember their ancient pact and their pledge to us, which is sacred.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So the elephants march on, and every tread beats out words in the dust: &quot;Watch, learn, love. Watch, learn, love.&quot; Can you hear them? One day in shame, the ghosts of ten thousand lords of the plains will say, &quot;We do not hate you. Don&#39;t you see at last? We were willing to fall, so that you, dear small ones, will never fall again.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">THE boy AND THE PILLOW</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A wise father wanted to teach his young son a lesson. &quot;Here is a pillow covered in silk brocade and stuffed with the rarest goose down in the land,&quot; he said. &quot;Go to town and see what it will fetch.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;First the boy went to the marketplace, where he saw a wealthy feather merchant. &quot;What will you give me for this pillow?&quot; he asked. The merchant narrowed his eyes. &quot;I will give you fifty gold ducats, for I see that this is a rare treasure indeed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The boy thanked him and went on. Next he saw a farmer&#39;s wife peddling vegetables by the side of the road. &quot;What will you give me for this pillow?&quot; he asked. She felt it and exclaimed, &quot;How soft it is! I&#39;ll give you one piece of silver, for I long to lay my weary head on such a pillow.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boy thanked her and walked on. Finally he saw a young peasant girl washing the steps of a church. &quot;What will you give me for this pillow?&quot; he asked. Looking at him with a strange smile, she replied, &quot;I&#39;ll give you a penny, for I can see that your pillow is hard compared to these stones.&quot; Without hesitation, the boy laid the pillow at her feet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he got home, he said to his father, &quot;I have gotten the best price for your pillow.&quot; And he held out the penny.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;	&quot;What?&quot; his father exclaimed. &quot;That pillow was worth a hundred gold ducats at least.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That&#39;s what a wealthy merchant saw,&quot; the boy said, &quot;but being greedy, he offered me fifty. I got a better offer than that. A farmer&#39;s wife offered me one piece of silver.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you mad?&quot; his father said. &quot;When is one piece of silver worth more than fifty gold ducats?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When it&#39;s offered out of love,&quot; the boy replied. &quot;If she had given me more, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to feed her children. Yet I got a better offer than that. I saw a peasant girl washing the steps of a church who offered me this penny.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You have lost your wits completely,&quot; his father said, shaking his head. &quot;When is a penny worth more than one piece of silver?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When it&#39;s offered out of devotion,&quot; the boy replied. &quot;For she was laboring for her Lord, and the steps of His house seemed softer than any pillow. Poorer than the poorest, she still had time for God. And that is why I offered her the pillow.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this the wise father smiled and embraced his son, and with a tear in his eye he murmured, &quot;You have learned well.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">enough FOR TODAY</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dance rehearsals can go on past midnight, but this time I stopped at ten. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind,&quot; I said, looking up into space, &quot;but that&#39;s enough for today.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A voice from the control room spoke. &quot;You okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A little tired, I guess,&quot; I said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I slipped on a windbreaker and headed down the hall. Running footsteps came up behind me. I was pretty sure who they belonged to. &quot;I know you too well,&quot; she said, catching up with me. &quot;What&#39;s really wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I hesitated. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know how this sounds, but I saw a picture today in the papers. A dolphin had drowned in a fishing net. From the way its body was tangled in the lines, you could read so much agony. Its eyes were vacant, yet there was still that smile, the one dolphins never lose, even when they die...&quot; My voice trailed off.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She put her hand lightly in mine. &quot;I know, I know.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No, you don&#39;t know all of it yet. It&#39;s not just that I felt sad, or had to face the fact that an innocent being had died. Dolphins love to dance -- of all the creatures in the sea, that&#39;s their mark. Asking nothing from us, they cavort in the waves while we marvel. They race ahead of ships, not to get there first but to tell us, &#39;It&#39;s all meant to be play. Keep to your course, but dance while you do it.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So there I was, in the middle of rehearsal, and I thought, &#39;They&#39;re killing a dance.&#39; And then it seemed only right to stop. I can&#39;t keep the dance from being killed, but at least I can pause in memory, as one dancer to another. Does that make any sense?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Her eyes were tender. &quot;Sure, in its way. Probably we&#39;ll wait years before everyone agrees on how to solve this thing. So many interests are involved. But it&#39;s too frustrating waiting for improvements tomorrow. Your heart wanted to have its say now.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, pushing the door open for her. &quot;I just had this feeling, and that&#39;s enough for today.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">MARK OF THE ancients</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He had lived in the desert all his life, but for me it was all new. &quot;See that footprint in the sand?&quot; he asked, pointing to a spot by the cliff.

The whole world abounds in magic. When a whale plunges out of the sea like a newborn mountain, you gasp in unexpected delight. What magic! But a toddler who sees his first tadpole flashing in a mud puddle feels the same thrill. Wonder fills his heart, because he has glimpsed for an instant the playfulness of life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I see the clouds whisked away from a snow-capped peak, I feel like shouting, &quot;Bravo!&quot; Nature, the best of all magicians, has delivered another thrill. She has exposed the real illusion, our inability to be amazed by her wonders. Every time the sun rises, Nature is repeating one command: &quot;Behold!&quot; Her magic is infinitely lavish, and in return all we have to do is appreciate it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What delight Nature must feel when she makes stars out of swirling gas and empty space.

The sound of applause rolls across the universe, and she bows.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">THE fish THAT WAS THIRSTY</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One night a baby fish was sleeping under some coral when God appeared to him in a dream. &quot;I want you to go forth with a message to all the fish in the sea,&quot; God said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What should I tell them?&quot; the little fish asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just tell them you&#39;re thirsty,&quot; God replied. &quot;And see what they do.&quot; Then without another word, He disappeared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next morning the little fish woke up and remembered his dream. &quot;What a strange thing God wants me to do,&quot; he thought to himself. But as soon as he saw a large tuna swimming by, the little fish piped up, &quot;Excuse me, but I&#39;m thirsty.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then you must be a fool,&quot; then tuna said. And with a disdainful flick of his tail, he swam away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The little fish did feel rather foolish, but he had his orders. The next fish he saw was a grinning shark. Keeping a safe distance, the little fish called out, &quot;Excuse me, sir, but I&#39;m thirsty.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then you must be crazy,&quot; the shark replied. Noticing a rather hungry look in the shark&#39;s eye, the little fish swam away quickly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All day he met cod and mackerels and swordfish and groupers, but every time he made his short speech, they turned their backs and would have nothing to do with him. Feeling hopelessly confused, the little fish sought out the wisest creature in the sea, who happened to be an old blue whale with three harpoon scars on his side.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Excuse me, but I&#39;m thirsty!&quot; the little fish shouted, wondering if the old whale could even see him, he was such a tiny speck. But the wise one stopped in his tracks. &quot;You&#39;ve seen God, haven&#39;t you?&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you know?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because I was thirsty once, too.&quot; The old whale laughed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The little fish looked very surprised. &quot;Please tell me what this message from God means,&quot; he implored.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It means that we are looking for Him in the wrong places,&quot; the old whale explained. &quot;We look high and low for God, but somehow He&#39;s not there. So we blame Him and tell ourselves that He must have forgotten us. Or else we decide that He left a long time ago, if He was ever around.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How strange,&quot; the little fish said, &quot;to miss what is everywhere.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very strange,&quot; the old whale agreed. &quot;Doesn&#39;t it remind you of fish who say they&#39;re thirsty?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">innocence</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s easy to mistake being innocent for being simpleminded or naive. We all want to seem sophisticated; we all want to seem street-smart. To be innocent is to be &quot;out of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yet there is a deep truth in innocence. A baby looks in his mother&#39;s eyes, and all he sees is love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As innocence fades away, more complicated things take its place. We think we need to outwit others and scheme to get what we want. We begin to spend a lot of energy protecting ourselves. Then life turns into a struggle. People have no choice but to be street-smart. How else can they survive?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When you get right down to it, survival means seeing things the way they really are and responding. It means being open. And that&#39;s what innocence is. It&#39;s simple and trusting like a child, not judgmental and committed to one narrow point of view. If you are locked into a pattern of thinking and responding, your creativity gets blocked. You miss the freshness and magic of the moment. Learn to be innocent again, and that freshness never fades.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">trust</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As I was feeding squirrels in the park, I noticed a small one that didn&#39;t seem to trust me. While the others came close enough to eat out of my hand, he kept his distance. I threw a peanut his way. He edged up, grabbed it nervously, and ran off. Next time he must have felt less afraid, because he came a little closer. The safer he felt, the more he trusted me. Finally he sat right at my feet, as bold as any squirrel clamoring for the next peanut.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trust is like that&mdash;it always seems to come down to trusting in yourself. Others can&#39;t overcome fear for you; you have to do it on your own. It&#39;s hard, because fear and doubt hold on tight. We are afraid of being rejected, of being hurt once more. So we keep a safe distance. We think separating ourselves from others will protect us, but that doesn&#39;t work, either. It leaves us feeling alone and unloved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Trusting yourself begins by recognizing that it&#39;s okay to be afraid. Having fear is not the problem, because everyone feels anxious and insecure sometimes. The problem is not being honest enough to admit your fear. Whenever I accept my own doubt and insecurity, I&#39;m more open to other people. The deeper I go into myself, the stronger I become, because I realize that my real self is much bigger than any fear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In accepting yourself completely, trust becomes complete. There is no longer any separation between people, because there is no longer any separation inside. In the space where fear used to live, love is allowed to grow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Courage</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s curious what takes courage and what doesn&#39;t. When I step out on stage in front of thousands of people, I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;m being brave. It can take much more courage to express true feelings to one person. When I think of courage, I think of the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz. He was always running away from danger. He often cried and shook with fear. But he was also sharing his real feelings with those he loved, even though he didn&#39;t always like those feelings.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That takes real courage, the courage to be intimate. Expressing your feelings is not the same as falling apart in front of someone else -- it&#39;s being accepting and true to your heart, whatever it may say. When you have the courage to be intimate, you know who you are, and you&#39;re willing to let others see that. It&#39;s scary, because you feel so vulnerable, so open to rejection. But without self-acceptance, the other kind of courage, the kind heroes show in movies, seems hollow. In spite of the risks, the courage to be honest and intimate opens the way to self-discovery. It offers what we all want, the promise of love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">love</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Love is a funny thing to describe. It&#39;s so easy to feel and yet so slippery to talk about. It&#39;s like a bar of soap in the bathtub &mdash; you have it in your hand until you hold on too tight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some people spend their lives looking for love outside themselves. They think they have to grasp it in order to have it. But loves slips away like that wet bar of soap.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Holding on to love is not wrong, but you need to learn to hold it lightly, caressingly. Let it fly when it wants. When it&#39;s allowed to be free, love is what makes life alive, joyful, and new. It&#39;s the juice and energy that motivates my music, my dancing, everything. As long as love is in my heart, it&#39;s everywhere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">god</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s strange that God doesn&#39;t mind expressing Himself/Herself in all the religions of the world, while people still cling to the notion that their way is the only right way. Whatever you try to say about God, someone will take offense, even if you say everyone&#39;s love of God is right for them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For me the form God takes is not the most important thing. What&#39;s most important is the essence. My songs and dances are outlines for Him to come in and fill. I hold out the form. She puts in the sweetness.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;ve looked up at the night sky and beheld the stars so intimately close, it was as if my grandmother had made them for me. &quot;How rich, how sumptuous,&quot; I thought. In that moment I saw God in His creation. I could as easily have seen Her in the beauty of a rainbow, the grace of a deer bounding through a meadow, the truth of a father&#39;s kiss. But for me the sweetest contact with God has no form. I close my eyes, look within, and enter a deep soft silence. The infinity of God&#39;s creation embraces me. We are one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">HOW I MAKE music</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">People ask me how I make music.

A walk through the woods brings a light crackling song : Leaves rustle in the wind, birds chatter and squirrels scold, twigs crunch underfoot, and the beat of my heart holds it all together. When you join the flow, the music is inside and outside, and both are the same. As long as I can listen to the moment, I&#39;ll always have music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span

the Wall, but what could they do? It was too strong to break through.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They feared the Wall, but didn&#39;t that make sense? Many who tried to climb over it were killed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They distrusted the Wall, but who wouldn&#39;t? Their enemies refused to tear down one brick, no matter how long the peace talks dragged on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Wall laughed grimly. &quot;I&#39;m teaching you a good lesson,&quot; it boasted. &quot;If you want to build for eternity, don&#39;t bother with stones. Hatred, fear, and distrust are so much stronger.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They knew the Wall was right, and they almost gave up. Only one thing stopped them. They remembered who was on the other side. Grandmother, cousin, sister, wife. Beloved faces that yearned to be seen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; the Wall asked, trembling. Without knowing what they did, they were looking through the Wall, trying to find their dear ones. Silently, from one person to another, love kept up its invisible work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stop it!&quot; the Wall shrieked. &quot;I&#39;m falling apart.&quot; But it was too late. A million hearts had found each other. The Wall had fallen before it came down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">MOTHER earth</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was walking along the beach one winter day. Looking down, I saw a wave push a feather up on the sand. It was a sea gull feather stained with oil. I picked it up and felt the dark slick film on my fingers. I couldn&#39;t help wondering if the bird had survived. Was it all right out there? I knew it wasn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I felt sad to think how carelessly we treat our home. The earth we all share is not just a rock tossed through space but a living, nurturing being. She cares for us; she deserves our care in return. We&#39;ve been treating Mother Earth the way some people treat a rental apartment. Just trash it and move on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But there&#39;s no place to move on to now. We have brought our garbage and our wars and our racism to every part of the world. We must begin to clean her up, and that means cleaning up our own hearts and minds first, because they led us to poison our dear planet. The sooner we change, the easier it will be to feel our love for Mother Earth and the love she so freely gives back to us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">WISE little GIRL</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I know a wise little girl who cannot walk. She is confined to a wheelchair, and she may spend the rest of her life there, since her doctors hold out almost no hope of ever making her paralyzed legs better.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I first met this little girl, she flashed me a smile that burned me with its blazing happiness. How open she was! She wasn&#39;t hiding out from self-pity or asking for approval or protecting herself from a sense of shame. She felt completely innocent about not being able to walk, like a puppy that has no idea if it is a mongrel or a champion of the breed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She made no judgments about herself. That was her wisdom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the same wise look in other children, &quot;poor&quot; children as society sees them, because they lack food, money, secure homes, or healthy bodies. By the time they reach a certain age, many of these children grasp just how bad their situation is. The way that adults look at their lives robs them of that first innocence that is so precious and rare. They begin to believe that they should feel bad about themselves; that this is &quot;right.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But this wise little girl, being only four, floated above pity and shame like a carefree sparrow. She took my heart in her hands and made it as weightless as a cotton puff, so that it was impossible for me to even begin to think, &quot;What a terrible thing.&quot; All I saw was light and love. In their innocence, very young children know themselves to be light and love. If we will allow them, they can teach us to see ourselves the same way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One sparkle from a little girl&#39;s gaze contains the same knowledge that Nature implants at the heart of every life-form. It is life&#39;s silent secret, not to be put into words. It just knows. It knows peace and how not to hurt. It knows that even the least breath is a gesture of gratitude to the Creator. It smiles to be alive, waiting patiently for ages of ignorance and sorrow to pass away like a mirage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I see this knowledge showing itself in the eyes of children more and more, which makes me think that their innocence is growing stronger. They are going to disarm us adults, and that will be enough to disarm the world. They feel no reason to spoil the environment, and so the environment will be cleaned up without a quarrel. A wise little girl told me the future when she looked at me, so full of peace and contentment. I rejoice in trusting her above all the experts. As light and love drive away our guilt and shame, her prophecy must come true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">I You we</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said you had to do it. You said you didn&#39;t want to. We talked about it, and we agreed that maybe I could help.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I said you were wrong. You insisted you were right. We held each other&#39;s hand, and right and wrong disappeared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I began crying. You began crying, too. We embraced, and between us grew a flower of peace.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;How I love this mystery called We! Where does it come from, out of thin air? I thought about this mystery, and I realized something : We must be love&#39;s favorite child, because until I reach out for you, We is not even there. It arrives on the wings of tenderness : it speaks through our silent understanding. When I laugh at myself, it smiles. When I forgive you, it dances in jubilation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So We is not a choice anymore, not if you and I want to grow with one another. We unites us, increases our strength; it picks up our burden when you and I are ready to let it fall. The truth is that you and I would have given up long ago, but We won&#39;t let us. It is too wise. &quot;Look into your hearts,&quot; it says. &quot;What do you see? Not you and I, but only We.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">angel OF LIGHT</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s hard to see angels, although I&#39;ve stared at their pictures for hours. Some people can see them without pictures, and they tell interesting tales. Guardian angels are all female, for instance, which didn&#39;t surprise me once I found out. A birth angel, recruited from the younger ranks, attends every baby when it appears, while another angel, older but not grim, helps the dying to leave this world without grief or pain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You can pray to the angels and they will listen, but the best way to call them, I am told, is to laugh. Angels respond to delight, because that is what they&#39;re made of. In fact, when people&#39;s minds are clouded by anger or hatred, no angel can reach them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Not all angels have wings&mdash;so the visionaries claim&mdash;but those who do can unfurl a span of golden feathers stretching over the entire world. If you had eyes that could look straight into the sun, you would see an overwhelming angel presiding there; a more serene one smiles out from the face of the moon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Angels spend their entire lives, which are forever, spinning around the Creator&#39;s throne, singing His praise. People with keen ears have listened in. The harmonies of the angelic choir are incredibly complex, they say, but the rhythm is simple. &quot;It&#39;s mostly march time,&quot; one eavesdropper affirmed. For some reason, that fact is almost the best I have learned so far.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After a while it got lonely hearing about angels you couldn&#39;t see for yourself. When an angel-watcher heard that, she was shocked. &quot;Not see?&quot; she said. &quot;But you have an angel in you. Everybody does. I can see it right now, and I thought you could, too.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; I said sadly, and I asked what it looked like. &quot;Did it look like me?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Well, yes and no,&quot; the angel-watcher mysterious answered. &quot;It all depends on what you think you are. Your angel is a speck of light perched at the very center of your heart. It is smaller than an atom, but just wait. Once you get close to it, your angel will expand. The closer you come, the more it will grow, until finally, in a burst of light, you will see your angel in its true shape, and at that very instant, you will also see yourself.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So now I am looking for my angel all the time. I sit silently, turning my gaze inward. It wasn&#39;t long before I caught a glimpse of something. &quot;Is that you, Angel, holding a candle?&quot; One flicker and it was gone. Yet that was enough to set my heart wildly beating. Next time my angel will be waving a lamp, then holding a torch aloft, then lighting a bonfire.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what the angel-watcher promised, and now that I have caught sight of glory, I know enough to believe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">I searched FOR MY STAR</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I was little, I used to lie on my back in the grass at night. I began to tell one star from another and wished that one of them could be mine, like an imaginary friend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;First I picked the Pole Star, because it is the easiest for a child to find, once you know that the Big Dipper is about to catch it. But I wanted my star to be a moving star, and not such a constant one. Besides, the sailors at sea would be lost without the Pole Star to guide them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next I picked out two special stars in the heart of the Swan. All the other stars looked white - but these were bright blue and gold. They reminded me of twin jewels, but before I could choose, I stopped. They belonged to each other, and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to take just one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Orion&#39;s belt caught my eye for a moment, but I&#39;m not a hunter. I had better leave the Dog Star alone, too, with its nose pressed to the celestial trail and its tail thumping the sky.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last of all I turned to my favorites, the Seven Sisters. To me they were like elegant ladies getting ready for a ball, wrapped in a gossamer blue cloud. But who has the heart to tear seven sisters apart?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My game taught me a lot about the night sky, but I was growing up. The whole idea of having my own star faded, and it was hard to remember if I had ever chosen one in the end. People began to tell me that the word &quot;star&quot; meant something quite different. I half believed them, then one night I was tossing in bed, hurt and worried. My heart felt heavy with troubles. Stumbling to my feet, I looked out the window. Thick clouds masked the midnight sky. No stars!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I trembled to think of a world without stars. No guide for the sailor to trust at sea, no jewels to dazzle our sense of beauty, no hunter pointing to the next horizon, no lovely ladies trailing perfume to heaven&#39;s ballroom. But all around the globe, the air is so dirty and the lights from the cities are so bright that for some people few stars can be seen anymore. A generation of children may grow up seeing a blank sky and asking, &quot;Did there used to be stars there?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Let&#39;s give them back the sky and let&#39;s do it now - before it&#39;s too late. I&#39;m going to search for my star until I find it. It&#39;s hidden in the drawer of innocence, wrapped in a scarf of wonder. I&#39;ll need a map to tell me which hole it should fill, and that will be a small one. But there are nearly five billion of us on earth, and we all need the sky. Find your star and throw it up to heaven. You still have it, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">A child IS A SONG</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When children listen to music, they don&#39;t just listen. They melt into the melody and flow with the rhythm. Something inside starts to unfold its wings&mdash;soon the child and the music are one. I feel that way, too, in the presence of music, and my best moments of creativity have often been spent with children. When I am around them, music comes to me as easily as breathing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Each song is a child I nourish and give my love to. But even if you have never written a song, your life is a song. How can it not be? In wave after wave, Nature caresses you&mdash;the rhythm of each dawn and each sunset is part of you, the falling rain touches your soul, and you see yourself in the clouds that are playing tag with the sun. To live is to be musical, starting with the blood dancing in your veins. Everything living has a rhythm. To feel each one, softly and attentively, brings out its music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel your music?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Children do, but once we grow up, life becomes a burden and a chore, and the music grows fainter. Sometimes the heart is so heavy that we turn away from it and forget that its throbbing is the wisest message of life, a wordless message that says, &quot;Live, be, move, rejoice&mdash;you are alive!&quot; Without the heart&#39;s wise rhythm, we could not exist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I begin to feel a little tired or burdened, children revive me. I turn to them for new life, for new music. Two brown eyes look at me so deeply, so innocently, and inside I murmur, &quot;This child is a song.&quot; It is so true and direct an experience that instantly I realize again, &quot;I am a song also.&quot; I am back to myself once more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p

||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I wanted to change the world, so I got up one morning and looked in the mirror. That one looking back said, &quot;There is not much time left. The earth is wracked with pain. Children are starving. Nations remain divided by mistrust and hatred. Everywhere the air and water have been fouled almost beyond help. Do something!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That one in the mirror felt very angry and desperate. Everything looked like a mess, a tragedy, a disaster. I decided he must be right. Didn&#39;t I feel terrible about these things, too, just like him? The planet was being used up and thrown away. Imagining earthly life just one generation from now made me feel panicky.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was not hard to find the good people who wanted to solve the earth&#39;s problems. As I listened to their solutions, I thought, &quot;There is so much good will here, so much concern.&quot; At night before going to bed, that one in the mirror looked back at me seriously, &quot;Now we&#39;ll get somewhere,&quot; he declared. &quot;If everybody does their part.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But everybody didn&#39;t do their part. Some did, but were they stopping the tide? Were pain, starvation, hatred, and pollution about to be solved? Wishing wouldn&#39;t make it so&mdash;I knew that. When I woke up the next morning, that one in the mirror looked confused. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s hopeless,&quot; he whispered.. Then a sly look came into his eyes, and he shrugged. &quot;But you and I will survive. At least we are doing all right.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I felt strange when he said that. There was something very wrong here. A faint suspicion came to me, one that had never dawned so clearly before. What if that one in the mirror isn&#39;t me? He feels separate. He sees problems &quot;out there&quot; to be solved. Maybe they will be, maybe they won&#39;t. He&#39;ll get along. But I don&#39;t feel that way&mdash;those problems aren&#39;t &quot;out there,&quot; not really. I feel them inside me. A child crying in Ethiopia, a sea gull struggling pathetically in an oil spill, a mountain gorilla being mercilessly hunted, a teenage soldier trembling with terror when he hears the planes fly over : Aren&#39;t these happening in me when I see and hear about them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next time I looked in the mirror, that one looking back had started to fade. It was only an image after all. It showed me a solitary person enclosed in a neat package of skin and bones. &quot;Did I once think you were me?&quot; I began to wonder. I am not so separate and afraid. The pain of life touches me, but the joy of life is so much stronger. And it alone will heal. Life is the healer of life, and the most I can do for the earth is to be its loving child.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That one in the mirror winced and squirmed. He hadn&#39;t thought so much about love. Seeing &quot;problems&quot; was much easier, because love means complete self-honesty. Ouch!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Oh, friend,&quot; I whispered to him, &quot;do you think anything can solve problems without love?&quot; That one in the mirror wasn&#39;t sure. Being alone for so long, not trusting others and being trusted by others, it tended to detach itself from the reality of life. &quot;Is love more real than pain?&quot; he asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can&#39;t promise that it is. But it might be. Let&#39;s discover,&quot; I said. I touched the mirror with a grin. &quot;Let&#39;s not be alone again. Will you be my partner? I hear a dance starting up. Come.&quot; That one in the mirror smiled shyly. He was realizing we could be best friends. We could be more peaceful, more loving, more honest with each other every day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Would that change the world? I think it will, because Mother Earth wants us to be happy and to love her as we tend her needs. She needs fearless people on her side, whose courage comes from being part of her, like a baby who is brave enough to walk because Mother is holding out her arms to catch him. When that one in the mirror is full of love for me and for him, there is no room for fear. When we were afraid and panicky, we stopped loving this life of ours and this earth. We disconnected. Yet how can anybody rush to help the earth if they feel disconnected? Perhaps the earth is telling us what she wants, and by not listening, we fall back on our own fear and panic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One thing I know : I never feel alone when I am earth&#39;s child. I do not have to cling to my personal survival as long as I realize, day by day, that all of life is in me. The children and their pain; the children and their joy. The ocean swelling under the sun; the ocean weeping with black oil. The animals hunted in fear; the animals bursting with the sheer joy of being alive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This sense of &quot;the world in me&quot; is how I always want to feel. That one in the mirror has his doubts sometimes. So I am tender with him. Every morning I touch the mirror and whisper, &quot;Oh, friend, I hear a dance. Will you be my partner? Come.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">|| </span><span class="cs31D24DEE">LOOK AGAIN, baby SEAL</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> ||</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the most touching nature photographs is of a baby fur seal lying on the ice alone. I&#39;m sure you have seen it -- the picture seems to be all eyes, the trusting dark eyes of a small animal gazing up at the camera and into your heart. When I first looked at them, the eyes asked, &quot;Are you going to hurt me?&quot; I knew the answer was yes, because thousands of baby seals were being killed every year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people were touched by one baby seal&#39;s helplessness. They gave money to save the seals, and public awareness started to shift. As I returned to the picture, those two wide eyes began to say something different. Now they asked, &quot;Do you know me?&quot; This time I didn&#39;t feel so much heartache as when I felt the violence man inflicts upon animals. But I realized that there was still a big gap. How much did I really know about life on earth? What responsibility did I feel for creatures outside my little space? How could I lead my life so that every cell of living matter was also benefited?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Everyone who began to wonder about these things found, I think, that their feelings were shifting away from fear toward more closeness with life as a whole. The beauty and wonder of life began to seem very personal; the possibility of making the planet a garden for all of us to grow in began to dawn. I looked into the eyes of the baby seal, and for the first time they smiled. &quot;Thank you,&quot; they said. &quot;You have given me hope.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Is that enough? Hope is such a beautiful word, but it often seems very fragile. Life is still being needlessly hurt and destroyed. The image of one baby seal alone on the ice or one baby girl orphaned in war is still frightening in its helplessness. I realized that nothing would finally save life on earth but trust in life itself, in its power to heal, in its ability to survive our mistakes and welcome us back when we learn to correct those mistakes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With these thoughts in my heart, I looked at the picture again. The seal&#39;s eyes seemed much deeper now, and I saw something in them that I had missed before: unconquerable strength. &quot;You have not hurt me,&quot; they said. &quot;I am not one baby alone. I am life, and life can never be killed. It is the power that brought me forth from the emptiness of space; it cared for me and nourished my existence against all dangers. I am safe because I am that power. And so are you. Be with me, and let us feel the power of life together, as one creature here on earth.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Baby seal, forgive us. Look at us again and again to see how we are doing. Those men who raise their clubs over you are also fathers and brothers and sons. They have loved and cared for others. One day they will extend that love to you. Be sure of it and trust.</span></p></body>
