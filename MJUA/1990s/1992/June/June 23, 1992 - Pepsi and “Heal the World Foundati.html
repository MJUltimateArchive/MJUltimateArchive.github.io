And yet, every minute, at least 28 children die. Today, our children are at risk of being killed by diseases, and by the violence of war, guns, abuse, and neglect. Children have few rights, and no one to speak for them. They have no voice in our world. God and nature have blessed me with a voice. Now I want to use it to help children speak for themselves. I have founded the &quot;Heal The World Foundation&quot; to be the voice of the voiceless: the children. Please join with me and the children to help heal the world together. Parents, communities, governments, all people of the world, we must put our children first. Finally, and most importantly, I want to tell the children of the world, you are all our children, each one of you is my child, and I love you all. Thank you very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-24-ca-803-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (June 24, 1992)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190919185842/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-24-ca-803-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop superstar Michael Jackson, 33, made a brief stopover in London en route to Munich where on Saturday he will start his first world tour in four years. At a news conference Tuesday in a maintenance hangar at Heathrow Airport, Jackson pledged to work for the children of the world and announced two projects: the $65,000 Michael Jackson International Children&rsquo;s Prize to be awarded to those who have done most to help children, and a World Council of Children &ldquo;to provide children with a forum to express their unique vision for healing the world.&rdquo; Jackson, dressed in a black military-style tunic and sporting mirror sunglasses, answered no questions before making a dramatic exit onto an aircraft that had been concealed behind a curtain on one side of the hangar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/495148468/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Independent&rdquo; (June 24, 1992)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (archived)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop stars are known for jetting into and out of press conferences. But not usually quite so literally. As Michael Jackson turned from 150 astonished journalists, a curtain opened and his personal airplane awaited. Surrealism continued over the broadcast system: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats while Michael Jackson&#39;s aircraft is cleared to leave the hangar.&quot; It had been that sort of afternoon. Those who cannot get a ticket for the concerts, and have not seen the video, should have been at the press conference. Held in a hangar for 747s at Heathrow airport, it was to feature a rare personal appearance by the superstar en route from Los Angeles to Munich for the start of his European tour, which reaches London next month. There was to be a major announcement. Michael Jackson, a Pepsi-Cola representative said, had come with &quot;a mission.&quot; It was to &quot;heal the world.&quot; There were, he said, &quot;concerns which Jackson and Pepsi share for the youth of today&quot;. . It was the establishment of &quot;The Heal the World Foundation.&quot; This modestly entitled brainchild of Jackson&#39;s had three goals to make SHOWING TRADEMARK GLOVE, Michael Jackson waves after press conference announcing new venture. them. Michael beamed. The Pepsi people read out to Michael what Michael was doing to help them. Michael beamed. And suddenly an awful truth began to dawn on the assembled throng. Michael was not going to speak. A personal appearance meant exactly that. But all was well.
