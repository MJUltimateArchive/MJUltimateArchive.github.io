		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rotterdam, Netherlands (Dangerous World Tour)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105652/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/telegraph_1992.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Telegraph&quot; magazine (August 1, 1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson is in his suite on the tenth floor of the Rotterdam Hilton, just along from my room. You can tell, because there is a large man standing outside et all times. On performance days, Jackson remains in his room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The curious aura of stardom feeds most voraciously on absence. When I pull aside the curtain at the window, the knot of young girls on the pavement below point and scream, because Michael Jackson is on the tenth floor too and the hand moving the curtain might just be his.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the lift doors open in the lobby, heads turn, lest it is Michael Jackson stepping out. The autograph hunters outside tense as the hotel doors swing open. As you pass through the gates at the Feyenoord Stadium, where Jackson is to perform, the attendants lean forward to scrutinize his image on your backstage pass.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Everybody who tours with Michael Jackson signs a confidentiality clause. I am not allowed to talk to his cook, or to his doctor. His manager, Jim Morey, says he&#39;d rather not. I can&#39;t find anybody who&#39;s not allowed to talk. That includes his security people. &quot;Do CIA guys talk about their job?&quot; says the tour publicist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I can&rsquo;t talk to Bill Bray who is Michael Jackson&#39;s right-hand man. When I see him [illegible] stage &mdash; an elderly grey-haired man in a [illegible] jacket and beanie hat, looking as [illegible] man on a fishing holiday &mdash; I ask if he can [illegible] five minutes. &quot;Sure thing,&rdquo; he says. &quot;I&#39;ll get right back to you.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I travel to the stadium with Michael Jackson&#39;s driver &mdash; an affable Englishman named John in a green Mercedes. Is this the same car that drives Michael Jackson to the concert [illegible]? &ldquo;This traffic&quot;, says John, &quot;it&#39;s terrible.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inside the stadium, a travelling [illegible] encamped backstage. encamped backstage. A marquee has been erected erected to provision the troops with [illegible] drink, but no alcohol. There are a number of powerfully built black men, whose business we don&rsquo;t quite know, but can guess. Their ID cards show them smiling, but they don&#39;t smile much in person. They&#39;re not sure who you are, and this worries them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Throughout the afternoon, the backstage area has been teeming with people &mdash; stage-bands, electricians, careers, roadies &mdash; but an hour before the show, the area is cordoned off. Everyone is moved to a safe distance, as though a small, controlled explosion is about to take place. It is into this vacant space that Michael Jackson will ultimately be delivered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By almost any statistical criteria, Michael Jackson is the biggest pop star in she world. His album &quot;Thriller&quot; has sold more than 43 million copies, making it the best-selling record of all time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I ask Barry Clayman: is Michael Jackson as big a star as he used to be? Clayman is promoting the British leg of the tour, which includes five nights in front of a total of 360,000 people at Wembley Stadium. &ldquo;All I know is, that&rsquo;s phenomenal&quot;, says Clayman. &quot;There is no another act in the world who could draw chose sorts of crowds. I think the man&#39;s a genius.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Clayman has been a promoter for 30 years. He promoted the first Beatles show in London, at the Pigalle nightclub in Piccadilly. He charged 12/6 admission and made &pound;500. &quot;It was like winning the football pools&rdquo;, he says. But you&#39;ll make a bit more from this, I say to him. &quot;Considerably more&quot;, says Clayman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I ask Clayman, what is Michael Jackson like? &quot;He&#39;s a gentleman&quot;, he says. &ldquo;And there&#39;s a lot of artists in this business who aren&#39;t.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I visit the wardrobe department to talk to Karen, Michael Jackson&#39;s makeup artist. She tells me to sit down and starts to make up my left eye. The mood of this tour, Michael has decreed, is &ldquo;street-edge, but interesting&quot;, so Karen arches and extends my eyebrow, making it &quot;dangerous&quot;, she says. Ours is an encounter fraught with tension. Two days earlier, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; had published a photograph which appeared to show Jackson&#39;s face in a state of advanced decay after allegedly extensive plastic surgery. Jackson&#39;s record company responded with denials and cries of foul.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Karen is a model of discretion. What makeup does Michael Jackson use? &quot;Base&quot;, she says. &ldquo;Eyeliner.&quot; A lot? &quot;A little.&quot; Any particular brand? &quot;I mix and blend.&quot; For the most part, she says, Michael does his own make-up, in the hotel, before the show. &quot;I put a little kit together for him. I fine tune him in the dressing-room before. And I&#39;ll touch him up a little during the show.&quot; But how does he look? &quot;He looks wonderful.&quot; So does my &quot;dangerous&quot; eye. I wear it for a while until the novelty pales, and then find I can&#39;t wash it off.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There are two dressing-room rituals which preface each show that Michael Jackson does. Immediately before the performance, Jackson and his band stand in a circle for a moment and pray. It is, guitarist Jennifer Batten tells me, to bring a sense of unity to the bend, instead of people coming in off the day with all sorts of scattered energy.&rdquo; At the end of the prayer, everybody screams, and then heads for the stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The other ritual has taken place earlier. This involves local executives from the Pepsi Cola company shaking bands with Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the past ten years, Pepsi Cola has sponsored tours by Tina Turner, David Bowie, and Madonna, as well as the Michael Jackson Bad tour in 1988. But its sponsorship for this tour is being touted as the largest ever deal between an entertainer and a corporation. While Pepsi refuses to give an exact figure, the agreement is said to be worth &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The contract is detailed and far-ranging. On Jackson&#39;s side, it entails money, to offset the cost of the tour and for his Heal The World Foundation, for which Pepsi has pledged to raise $1 million. In return, Pepsi buys the rights to &quot;signage&quot; at concerts; the authority to use Jackson&#39;s image in its advertising and to incorporate the Pepsi symbol into the tour logo, which decorates the tour jackets, caps and backstage passes, and projected onto huge &quot;jumbotron&quot; video screens on either side of the stage. It also buys between ten and 15 minutes of Michael Jackson&#39;s time each evening, to shake the hands of Pepsi executives, bottling agents, and VIPs. This is the tight knot of besuited businessmen standing rather self-consciously backstage, clutching an array of gifts, and waiting to be ushered smoothly and efficiently into Jackson&#39;s dressing-room by the Pepsi coordinator, a laid-back, pony-tailed man named Scooter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;What this does,&rdquo; says Scooter, &ldquo;is generate in-house excitement for Pepsi, which in they mind translates out into the field. In other words, they&#39;ll have their bottlers come here and meet Michael and get all excited about it and say what a great promotion it was. That can filter into a situation that will sell product for them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They&#39;ll talk, shake hands, take some pictures. Often the Pepsi people are shy. Michael&#39;s the biggest star in the world. People don&#39;t know what to say around him. But he&#39;ll loosen them up and maybe they&#39;ll talk about other things, like music.&rdquo; In certain instances, rather like the Queen on a State visit, Jackson will be given a symbolic gift &mdash; an Italian motorcycle, or a Japanese Samurai sword. These are shipped back to Jackson&#39;s home, to join the gifts from other bottling agents, drink executives, and promoters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then there&rsquo;s the publicity angle, says Scooter. &quot;Like, we just did a hospital, where Michael visited the children and a check was donated in his name, by Pepsi, to start a playroom. Michael loves to deal with kids, and kids who are ill love to have him visit them. You should see their faces. It&#39;s real touching. And on the other hand it&#39;s good, clean, healthy publicity for Pepsi.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So what, I ask Scooter, is Michael Jackson really like? &ldquo;He&#39;s a very bright guy&quot;, says Scooter. &ldquo;He knows every move he&rsquo;s making. He knows the seriousness of Pepsi&#39;s intent, and his own intent.&quot; Before Jackson visited Japan in 1987, Scooter tells me, Pepsi was only a minor player in the Japanese soft-drinks market. By the end of the tour, it had gained a three per cent share. &quot;And that&quot;, says Scooter, &quot;is remarkable.&quot; ...Those who know say that when Michael Jackson first meets strangers he looks up, down, around, but never at them: the reflex action one who knows he is always being looked at. It is possible that Michael Jackson does not know what normal behavior is, because he has never known normality.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Man&quot;, says David Williams, the guitarist who has contributed to all of Jackson&#39;s records since 1979, &quot;I think about that, and it&#39;s just amazing to me how he&#39;s handled all of this. If I was him, I&#39;d just head off for the hills of India or someplace, but Michael just focuses on something and does it. He knows exactly what he&#39;s doing in everything. I remember during the recording of &quot;Thriller&quot;, be told me what he wanted was to get total respect in the music industry. He&#39;s gotten that, but Micheel... he always wants to go further and top his own achievements.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...People who work around Jackson talk about &ldquo;Michael&#39;s dreams&quot; and making them come true. It is only when you get close to this show that you fully realize what a massive undertaking this is. Michael&#39;s dreams do not come cheap. They include the use of three pounds of explosives each night, three lasers, 115 separate channels for sound, producing 240,000 watts, all run off three generators providing enough power to light up a small town.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The dreams also require an army of dancers, musicians, and stage crew. The permanent road crew numbers 160. With the addition of local crew, that number swells to 240. It requires 57 trucks to haul the equipment around Europe. It takes 23 hours to erect the stage, eight hours to dismantle it. &ldquo;Too long&quot;, says Benny Collins, the production manager. By the end of the tour he hopes to get it down to six.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael&#39;s personally involved in everything&quot;, says Collins. &quot;He&#39;s the one who&#39;ll say he wants more light, a bigger effect, whatever, no one else. He looks at everything, pays attention to everything. He controls the whole mess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But what, I ask David Williams, is Michael Jackson like? Williams scratches his chin. &quot;He&#39;s quiet. Shy. Witty. Very talented.&quot; (People around Jackson tend to talk in these short, epigrammatic bursts. When I ask Benny Collins the same question, he says &ldquo;Magic. Affection. Fun. Professionalism. Tenacity.&quot;)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You&#39;re in the studio with Michael,&rdquo; says Williams, &ldquo;he&#39;ll just sit there, won&#39;t make a sound. But when it&rsquo;s right, he&#39;ll start dancing. He don&#39;t say a word, man. Just slides across the floor...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael&#39;s no fabrication&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;He&#39;s totally genuine. And he&#39;s funny too. Michael&#39;s totally normal. We talk about food, women, music, the movies &mdash; ordinary things.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Would Benny Collins ever describe him as unusual? &ldquo;Who, Michael? Unusual?&quot; Collins obviously thinks the question is ridiculous. &quot;No, I think he&#39;s quite a sharp dresser actually.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But is he an interesting person to be around? &ldquo;Yeah, he&#39;s into a lot of things people aren&#39;t aware of. Antiques, Antique books. He&#39;s an insatiable reader. And he&#39;s into people, into what they believe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But what, I ask, is he really like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael? He&rsquo;s just Michael. He&#39;s just like you and me&quot;, says Collins. &quot;Only he&rsquo;s a star.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once Michael Jackson is safely inside his dressing-room, the bustle outside resumes. The mood of anticipation rises by palpable degrees. Michael is here. He is waiting to happen. A few minutes before the show is scheduled to begin, the area is cleared once again, and a sleek Mercedes limousine pulls up outside the dressing-room door to convey Michael Jackson the 40 yards to the stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He appears, quite literally, with a bang, drenched in a shower of golden sparkles falling from the roof of the stage, and for perhaps two minutes he stands, frozen. The fever, the press-hype, the talk of big bucks... whether it&#39;s bigger or better than before &mdash; all is momentarily stilled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jackson&#39;s performance is a child&#39;s fantasy of gangster and horror movies, and video games and space rockets. And yet, there are two moments in particular: when one feels Jackson comes closest to self-revelation. The first is during a song called &quot;Human Nature&quot; &mdash; &nbsp;a pretty ballad from &quot;Thriller&quot; &mdash; when the tumult is stilled and there is only Jackson, strolling across the stage, singing, as if to himself, rapt, ecstatic, perfectly at ease.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The second moment comes, incongruously enough, when he sings &quot;Heal the World&quot; &mdash; the song of the Foundation &mdash; and children dressed in national costume parade around an inflatable globe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Belief, and the suspension of disbelief, they are the very heart of what Michael Jackson does. Three times during the performance, he contrives his own disappearance by a series of illusions, the piece de resistance coming at the end when Jackson appears to fly from the stage with rocket-boosters attached to his back--a high tech Peter Pan, flying back to Neverland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before the show, I am sitting talking to Clayman, We have found a seat inside the dressing-room area. Suddenly, a red van pulls up outside. Bill Bray gets out, followed by a young boy, two attendants, and Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He moves into the room, tall, slender figure in black trousers and a gold lame jacket. His face is white. The whitest face I&#39;ve ever seen. Camembert cheese. The moon. It&#39;s impossible to tell if he is wearing mascara or not. There is a slash [illegible] red at the mouth. How strange now, to see that face, caught in that fragment of time utter familiarity and first appraisal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He recognizes Clayman, holds out his hand, and barely whispers, &ldquo;How you doin&#39;?&rdquo; At the same moment, he notices me, sees me staring, everyone does, staring with my &quot;dangerous&quot; eye. In an involuntary gesture, be lifts his arm across his face, to block me from view. And then walking away. Not so much a walk as a lope, street-strut, bouncing on the soles of his shoes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So, I am asked by somebody afterwards, what is Michael Jackson like? He was there, I say, and then he was gone.</span></p></body>
