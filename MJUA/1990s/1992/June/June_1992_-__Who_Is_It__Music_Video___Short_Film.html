His collaboration with Jackson foretells the elegant, sinister, uncompromising style he&#39;d bring to his movies. The gorgeous video, in which Michael falls for a high-priced escort and stares sadly at the city skyline, survives on video anthologies and has racked up 6 million YouTube plays. &quot;To me it was very simple: Either we agree on what we&#39;re gonna do or we don&#39;t,&quot; said Fincher about working with musicians. &quot;But, I&#39;m not gonna trick you into doing something you don&#39;t wanna do.&quot; </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Glenn Ribble, MTV producer, personal blog post (February 12, 2014) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428164240/http://michael-jackson.glennribble.com/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David Fincher had directed a high-budget video for &ldquo;Who Is It&rdquo; in Brazil for the release of the single on August 31, 1992. Michael Jackson was on tour at the time, and a double was used for the location shots from the balcony of the hotel. Michael rejected Fincher&rsquo;s video; he felt that it didn&rsquo;t accurately represent the song. Needless to say, David Fincher was enraged when my version [(compilation video)] appeared on MTV with images from Michael&rsquo;s previous videos, many of which Fincher had shot, with me listed as the director. The other directors and labels were upset as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s believed Michael walked out after the first day of filming, after becoming disappointed with Fincher&rsquo;s overall approach to the shoot. This may explain why Michael was never happy with it. A body double was used in some scenes to complete the video.</span></p></body>
