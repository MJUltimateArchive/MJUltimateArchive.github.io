We got together and we went to Germany and we shot this thing in just like two hours. We had no time at all to shoot it. We wanted it to be exciting and fantastical and fans, you know, like it&#39;s a rock concert and that&#39;s how it ends up-that&#39;s the result.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Daniel Pearl, cinematographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/moviegeeksunited/2009/06/28/mike-medavoy-michael-jackson-cinematographer-danie"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Movie Geeks United&quot; (June 28, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Daniel Pearl</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Give In To Me we shot in Munich, Germany, Michael was preparing to go on a big European tour, so he was already in Germany rehearsing. Andy Morahan was the director... We shot that in an abandoned railway repair factory, and they had big turntables where you could drive an old steam locomotive onto this track, and the track could rotate 180 or 360 to turn around and get the train back out. And there were a lot of different heights and levels to this place where Andy had us build this steamy, kind of sex-oriented club, not over the top, nothing too bad. [The audience] sorta has a little bit of a dark side to it in my mind, and I think it&#39;s also very interesting cuz it&#39;s a little darker than Michael was going at that time too... What we weren&#39;t aware of was that there were Russians there, I don&#39;t know if the Iron Curtain was just down around this time, they were bringing in cowhides by the truckload &nbsp;which they were tanning there, which had this outrageous odor that permeated the whole building. They actually installed a perfume system throughout the building for the time-period that Michael would be in there, and we were working there, that one we had a 2-day shoot, we had only 7 hours with Michael. So we pre-lit, we lit it very carefully... Those of you who have seen it, I thought I did some interesting things, I had some new lights that I&#39;d never seen before, some programmable small Xenons that would actually be remote-controlled by a computer. I had, I think, eight cameramen, eight operators working for me at that time with the director, and I had just finished everything, got it all tweaked up and I was showing the director who was setup at the back of this massive room we were in with his eight monitors, showing him all the various cameras and we were playing the track and we probably had a stand-in in for Michael and we were running the lights... Michael&#39;s manager, at the time, was sitting with Andy. And so, when [Andy] was done, he goes, &quot;Daniel, it look fantastic, it&#39;s really good now. As soon as I have a word with Michael, we&#39;ll start shooting. You&#39;re ready, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m ready. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the manager goes, &quot;Oh no, Andy, I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re not gonna get to speak with Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Andy goes, &quot;Are you crazy, man? Daniel, get ready to take it all down.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now this is a million plus [dollars] video... I&#39;m told to be on stand-by and ready to give orders to strike the whole thing, we&#39;re not gonna shoot it. The manager goes, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Andy goes, &quot;No, no, under no circumstances will I shoot this video until I have spoken to Michael Jackson.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He goes, &quot;Alright, alright, alright. I can see you&#39;re serious about that. Hang on a second.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The manager gets up, he goes away to go see Michael at his - he had a quadrangle of RVs, four of them that were setup with one way in and out that lead right into our building. And I walked over to Andy and I said, &quot;Andy, are you kidding, man? ...I mean this would be gigantic if we don&#39;t shoot this. There&#39;s gonna be lawsuits, all kinds of shit will go down.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He goes, &quot;Daniel, the rest of my life, people are gonna ask me, &#39;What was it like to work with Michael Jackson?&#39; What am I gonna say, &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And the manager came back, he says, &quot;Ok, Andy, come right this way, Michael will have a word with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Andy went away for about 10 - 15 minutes, came back, he said,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Alright guys, I&#39;ve spoken to him, I told him what I wanted him to do. We&#39;re good to go.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And we went and we shot it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Movie Geeks United</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Was there much conversation between Michael and the directors on these shoots typically?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Daniel Pearl</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No, in fact, going into &quot;Give In To Me&quot;, we were all told that &quot;you will not speak to Michael Jackson, you will not look at Michael Jackson, and for God&#39;s sake, you will not take his picture.&quot;... I was allowed to look at him, I was allowed to take his picture. The assistant director, a very dear friend of mine as well, a man named Ian Patrick, he was allowed to speak to him to tell him &quot;We&#39;re ready&quot; [and] to bring him to and from the stage, but was really told not to look at him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyhow, so we went and we did it. We got it done, and it turned out pretty well, I think. I think even Michael was happy with it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">***Footnotes***</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The &ldquo;abandoned railway repair factory&rdquo; was located at 166 Landsberger Stra&szlig;e, Munich, Germany, according to <a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CDe_aPsA4lQC&amp;pg=PT480&amp;lpg=PT480&amp;dq=1992+michael+jackson+%22visual+documentary%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nRn__-9g6r&amp;sig=2Cx_6C3uAyKbhkI5DemfjKRMUp4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4lO6NhNTQAhWC44MKHcX3BrUQ6AEINzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22give%20in%20to%20me%20at%20166%22&amp;f=false"><span class="cs8567212B">Adrian Grant&rsquo;s Visual Documentary</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p></body>
