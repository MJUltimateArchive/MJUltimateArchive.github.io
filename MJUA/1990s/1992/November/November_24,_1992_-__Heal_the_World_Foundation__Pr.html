You have gorgeous voices. Thank you very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Looks forward] Children show me in their playful smiles the divine in everyone. This simple goodness shines straight from their hearts. Being with them connects us to the deeper wisdom of life. These children are a reminder of the preciousness of all life, especially young lives untouched by hatred, prejudice and greed. Now, when the world is so confused and its problems so complicated, we need our children more than ever. Their natural wisdom points the way to solutions that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts. Children are the world&#39;s foremost idealists and optimists. It is for that reason that &ldquo;Heal The World&quot; is organizing the World&#39;s Children Congress next year, made up exclusively of delegates, aged 8 to 16. The world desperately needs their innocent perspective on the world&#39;s problems. We have to heal our wounded planet of the chaos, despair and senseless destruction we see today. The mission of HTW, my mission, is healing, pure and simple. To heal the world, we must start by healing our children. Today, we come bearing gifts for the children of war-torn Sarajevo. In 1992, Sarajevo has become a symbol of so much that is tragic, but avoidable in our world. Prejudice and ethnic hatred, the destruction of the environment, the shattering of families and of centuries-old communities. We are pleased to announce at this special time of year that we will turn our efforts home, to the plight of our American children. Towards this end, we are planning &quot;Convoy USA&quot;. This will be an effort to help all Americans work together towards a single objective: to heal the children of our inner cities. This Thanksgiving is particularly special to me, with the launch of the single, &quot;Heal The World&quot;. I wrote this song for everyone in our world, in an effort to help bring global harmony. All the proceeds of this song will go to the foundation. Thank you, all, for coming. Special thanks to AmeriCares, for standing side by side with us in this project. To all of you who have supported &quot;Heal The World&quot; with time and donations, our prayers and thanks. Now the children of the African Children&rsquo;s Choir and the United Nations International School Choir will join me in sending messages of hope and peace to the children of Sarajevo. Thank you, and I love you all. Thank you very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://dailyherald.newspaperarchive.com/daily-herald-suburban-chicago/1992-11-25/page-2/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Herald&rdquo; (November 25, 1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop superstar Michael Jackson Tuesday helped send off $2.1 million worth of relief supplies for Sarajevo, where thousands are in need due to fierce fighting in the city. Jackson&rsquo;s Heal the World Foundation has teamed up with Ameri-Cares to deliver the much-needed supplies. The 93,700-pound cargo includes medical supplies, blankets, winter clothing and shoes. They were packed aboard an AmeriCares DC-8 cargo plane bound for Zagreb. &ldquo;Today we come bearing gifts for war-torn Sarajevo. In 1992 Sarajevo has become a symbol of so much that is tragic but avoidable in our world,&rdquo; Jackson said at a cargo hangar at New York&rsquo;s Kennedy International Airport as the plane was being loaded. Jackson paid the $150,000 for the cost of the chartered flight. </span></p></body>
