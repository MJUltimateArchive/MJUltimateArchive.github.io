I was being obedient.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">NARRATOR: Although she appeared nearly naked in photographs and on the runway, this solo erotic dance brought back the shy little girl in the supermodel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">NAOMI: Well, we had black curtains and everything.

It was fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">NAOMI: He had a discipline probably of what it was like to do film, because it&rsquo;s doing the same thing over and over again, picking up,picking up, in the heat, and the continuity of how your hair has to be, how your makeup has to be, like you wanted to change something on the second day, you can&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s the way you started off, that&rsquo;s the way you have to keep going.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">NARRATOR: And what did the King of Pop compare the Queen of the Fashion Kingdom to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">NAOMI: The sweetest thing Michael said to me was, um, that I reminded him of a fawn, which is like a baby deer. He said that is what he thought I looked like. I thought that like a &ldquo;Bambi,&rdquo; and I thought that was very sweet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">NAOMI (during the end of the show, when she was commenting on everybody):</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He is a brilliant artist.

During that time, and in the run-up to the launch, I got to see a lot of Michael Jackson. Our first meeting took place in the middle of the Californian desert: Jackson was throwing a huge dinner party just yards away from where he had been shooting his in the Closet video with the beautiful British model, Naomi Campbell; and fifty miles outside the fashionable Californian holiday resort of Palm Springs. The party was staged in conjunction with top pop TV station, MTV. MTV had run a competition offering dinner with Michael Jackson as the prize, and they had received a staggering 4.1 million entries from all over the world. Thirty lucky winners realized the dream of a lifetime: they were Michael&#39;s and MTV&#39;s special guests that night at the party, which was attended by a hundred privileged guests. Demi Woo from Taiwan told me: &#39;I still can&#39;t believe it&#39;s true. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve met Michael. He&#39;s my absolute hero.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The E150,000 bash was one of the most spectacular parties the pop world had ever seen: it featured leopards, panthers, elephants, camels, near-naked girl samba dancers, magicians and fire-eaters. Michael, decked out in a black shirt with red epaulettes and black satin trousers, arrived at the party at 7 o&#39;clock, just an hour after breaking off from his video-shooting. The normally reclusive pop star revealed a side of his personality that he had kept under wraps for years - that of a fun-loving extrovert. We saw once again what Jackson was like when he really let his hair down. At one point he even led a conga line up and down the length of the makeshift tent where the party was held. As the evening went on, his smile got larger and larger. At one point he even gave us a private preview of his dancing skills: he got up on the dance floor and showed why he is such a disco thriller. He boogied with guests, including some of the skimpily clad Brazilian dancers dressed in yellow bras and G-strings who had earlier entertained him. I danced alongside him but found it hard to keep up with his frantic steps. The singer, then thirty-three years old, was having such fun that he spent a whole two hours at the party, even posing for group pictures with the winners. For much of the time he chatted, laughed and joked with Naomi Campbell, who sat by his side. He seemed more relaxed and at ease than he had for a long time. Also sitting at the table with Jackson was his video director, top fashion photographer Herb Ritts. The video, in which Jackson is featured with Naomi Campbell and four flamenco dancers, was shot in black and white and Ritts was thrilled with it. He told me: &#39;Michael was a dream to work with. He is very receptive of new ideas. We should have finished already but we&#39;ve had some bad weather.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the bash nearly started off on a nasty note. As he arrived, the animal-loving Michael went to stroke a baby leopard which snapped at him viciously. However, the singer refused to be daunted: he joked with the animal&#39;s trainer, gathered up a couple of the children who were waiting outside to meet him, and made his way into the party, where he was greeted with screams and shrieks from the waiting guests. He was escorted to the top table, where he sat down to sign autographs and talk to awestruck fans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He himself was awestruck as he watched the fire-eaters, the acrobats and the dancers who had been summoned to perform for the king of all performers. He was astounded when one of the troupe lay on a four-foot bed of nails while a pretty girl walked all over his back. At this point, Jackson sat a little three-year-old girl on his knee so she could get a better view of some of the show. He was just as impressed with the magician, who came to his table and performed a variety of dazzling card tricks. &#39;I&#39;d like to do some of those,&#39; he told him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the party Jackson confessed: &#39;I&#39;m having a wonderful time. Some of these acts are amazing. It&#39;s a real fun atmosphere.&#39; When his minders and aides tried to get him to go, Jackson wouldn&#39;t budge. He told them: &#39;I want to see the next act, it&#39;s a guy who walks on broken glass and eats it.&#39; The star sat rooted in his chair for the next fifteen minutes as he marvelled at the daredevil performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The food was every bit as good as the entertainment. It had been prepared by Jackson&#39;s special Sikh chef, who runs a catering company called Ashaka and cooks all Jackson&#39;s meals for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The singer admitted he was thrilled about touring again for the first time in four years: &#39;I&#39;m really looking forward to performing again. I love being on stage. I can&#39;t wait to come to Britain. ! had a great time when I was in London recently.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite his enjoyment, the party left Jackson whacked. When one of the MTV winners, Margarietta Carreras from New Jersey, asked him to dance the smiling star told her: &#39;I&#39;d love to, but please excuse me this time, I feel a little tired.&#39; Then the singer told MTV bosses, &#39;Thanks for everything, it&#39;s been a thriller of an evening,&#39; and disappeared into the desert night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/56196641.html"><span class="cs8567212B">USA Today</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.lipstickalley.com/showthread.php/218973-Ladies-in-Michael-s-Life-III?p=4853332&amp;viewfull=1#post4853332"><span class="cs8567212B">Mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The usually shy superstar danced in a conga line and dined on vegetarian fare with model Naomi Campbell and photographer Herb Ritts. &ldquo;He was having a good time,&rdquo; says contest winner Donna Frieden, who shook Jackson&rsquo;s ungloved hand. &ldquo;He was reserved and soft-spoken, but very warm. He was smiling a lot. I jumped right next to him in the conga line.&rdquo; Jackson, who wrapped his In the Closet video earlier on a nearby set, visited with the lynx, panther and other exotic creatures before joining the festivities. &ldquo;He was laughing and chatting it up with everyone,&rdquo; says MTV&rsquo;s Kathy Flynn, who arranged for the party&rsquo;s carnival games, stilt walkers, magician, palm reader, Brazilian dancers and Caribbean band. A camel, an elephant, a black panther and a spider monkey that drank virgin daiquiris were among those at MTV&rsquo;s lavish tented bash Sunday outside Palm Springs, Calif.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Fan who attended, &ldquo;It&#39;s All About L.O.V.E.&rdquo; book</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The cameras flashed; cameramen were filming like crazy, and out of the blue came Naomi Campbell to join us. She is so tall that she had to wear flats, but is so beautiful, not to mention sexy. All of us laughed and danced and had such good time. Michael was giggling and turning the wrong way, we did too, and then he giggled again. The music changed and he and Naomi danced together. I noticed, too, she would constantly be bending her head next to Michael&rsquo;s ear and Michael seemed very annoyed with her that after a while he left her and danced with the kids.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5549FC95">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, Glenda Tapes</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: You like living &ldquo;In the Closet&rdquo; best (laughing)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">G: Yeh..Which one do you like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: I like Remember the Time.

Like many of those projects I was there for much of it, but behind the scenes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time the Dangerous project was winding down I was juggling a lot of things. We had projects rolling full speed at Neverland (I seem to remember the Sea Dragon and Zipper were installed around that time), plus I was working with Bruce, Bill and Teddy in the studio wrapping up the album. That of course meant short films and tour prep were either beginning or just around the corner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael loved a large, portable music playback system I built for him to use on the short films (I have written about it before), but essentially it was an estimated 20,000 watt monster that would and could &quot;hurt you&quot; if you weren&#39;t careful. Michael wasn&#39;t careful. At all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hurt me!! Hurt me!!&quot; he would yell as we set the system up for shooting &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;2Bad&quot;, &quot;Closet&quot;, etc. The volume this thing produced could send even the most jaded, know-it-all production person into the craft services (&quot;Crafty&quot;) snack tent to roll up some napkins and stuff them in their ears. I loved it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on the &quot;Closet&quot; shoot for two reasons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First, I wasn&#39;t in the union, so I couldn&#39;t actually operate my own system - it had to be handled by a union guy. I just set it up, tuned it, made sure Michael was happy and handed over the keys to the union guy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Second, and you might find this odd, but Michael had put my family and I up in a really nice resort in Palm Springs, and we loved the idea of a few days of down-time, so I spent much of that time poolside, knowing that I might have to drive to the set if my system needed attention. It didn&#39;t, so I relaxed much of the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Production shoots were always much more intense than working on the albums. There were people everywhere, with lots of radios and clipboards (this was before iPads) and laminates and stopwatches. Security guys guard every entrance with their official windbreakers and Security baseball caps.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rows production trailers, dressing rooms, star trailers, honeywagons (bonus points if you know what they are), generators, catering trucks, lighting trucks, lighting guys, sound guys, set guys, safety people, production assistants (PA&#39;s), craft services, etc. Shooting a Michael Jackson film in Southern California is like moving, organizing and paying for an army - and they can do almost anything once they are assembled.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So again, it was interesting, but the layers and hierarchy of people and who could stand where and when and why and made my pool and a bottle of Corona really inviting on most days.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5549FC95">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5549FC95"><a class="cs27ADD154" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808122000im_/http://0101.nccdn.net/1_5/14b/3da/169/1226623177623166.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Daily Express&quot; (1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Top model Naomi Campbell, who was photographed naked with Madonna, has been turning on her sensual charms for pop superstar Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Naomi, a former girlfriend of disgraced boxer Mike Tyson and actor Robert de Niro, teamed up with Jackson for his raunchy new video.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...A worker on the film set revealed: &quot;Most people tend to keep a slight distance from Michael, but not Naomi.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sensuous</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;She was asked to give a sensuous performance and she certainly did--she really went for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael was somewhat taken aback, but I think he appreciated someone who was natural with him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson... sent a private jet to fly her straight to Los Angeles from a modeling shoot in London.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Naomi, who was born in Streatham, South London, said: &quot;It was a fantastic experience.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5549FC95">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs5549FC95"><a class="cs27ADD154" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105722/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dtour1.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Daily Mirror&quot; (1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The star invited leopards, panthers, elephants, camels, a bunch of Brazilian [dancers], and some friends... including me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Jackson was so busy making a beast of himself, he barely noticed those saucy samba dancers flashing their South American smiles behind him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael sat at a table beside top British model Naomi Campbell while the buxom beauties swayed in rhythm.

We&#39;re driven to Palm Springs on the border of the Palm Desert in Southern California. Only the driver knows where we&#39;re going. As our bus trundles through the desert, it begins to tip down with rain and thunder rumbles in the sky. The bus is nearly drowned to a halt. Thankfully, after a few minutes, the sky clears, and a double rainbow appears--we&#39;re on our way again!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An hour later, we see a huge tent ahead of us. The other people on the bus--35 winners of an MTV competition to meet Michael--cheer. As we get nearer, we see a midget dressed as America&#39;s Uncle Sam on stilts, a magician wearing a gold lam&eacute; cape and turban, a juggler, and a clown, as well as an elephant, camel, black panther, and kangaroo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just by the tent is the set for Michael&#39;s video. It&#39;s like a spooky, deserted town in a western, with a Mexican ranch and a few dead trees thrown in for good measure. In the tent, a huge party has been arranged for us. There&#39;s exotic food, and [cookies] iced &quot;My Dinner With Michael&quot; to nibble on. Michael, we&#39;re told, was involved in all the preparations for the party--he had the animals flown in and the food that we are about to eat has been prepared by his private chef!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Suddenly, there is a small riot at the tent entrance--Michael is here! Except it&#39;s not him, but a double, Darrick Morgan, who signs a few autographs! He appears in the &quot;Remember the Time&quot; video as the dark stranger in the black robe who throws sand on the floor in front of pharaoh Eddie Murphy. He sometimes helps Michael make a quick getaway: Darrick drives off in a massive limo, while Michael runs out the side door! Michael will arrive at any time now. Knees knocking in anticipation, we stand and wait.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A long black limousine steps in front of us. The king of pop steps out. He is immaculately dressed in black satin, with a red armband and shiny black patent pumps. He goes up to the camel and strokes it. Then he turns and faces us. It&#39;s hard to know if he&#39;s looking in our direction because he&#39;s wearing very dark sunglasses. His assistant introduces us. Michael shakes hands, The king has arrived--let the party begin!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is determined to have a good time. Sitting with his friends, Madonna&#39;s favorite photographer Herb Ritts and supermodel Naomi Campbell, who appeared in the video with him, he pours wine (but drinks only water) and jokes. It seems he&#39;s just one of the lads when the cameras aren&#39;t around.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One by one, the fans come to the table, with small presents (an Australian girl has brought a huge koala) or just a smile. They are greeted by Michael, who shakes hands with the boys and plays with the girls&#39; hair while whispering in their ear. Needless to say, they come away from the [illegible] swooning! Everbody is made to feel at home. What did he whisper? No one remembers. It&#39;s as if you went into a trance at the [sight] of him being just a regular guy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The orchestra in the tent starts to play a conga and the singer in the band asks everybody to join in. Suddenly, Michael jumps up and joins everybody in a tango! The world&#39;s greatest star is dancing with a dozen guests around the tables! The whole troupe gather on eht tiny dancefloor at one end of the tent and join Michael in some lambada steps and hand-clapping.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He then goes back to his table and munches on a plate of macrobiotic tortillas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then it&#39;s &quot;BIG&quot;&#39;s turn to meet Michael and it takes some courage to go up to the table and speak. We thank him for the unforgettable evening. He smiles and thanks us back! Then he goes to ask us some questions! &quot;Are you having a good time? Where do you come from? Did you come to California especially for the evening?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...We ask him why he chose the desert setting for the video. He answers in his high, but soft-toned voice: &quot;The light here is incomparable. There is nothing like it. It&#39;s the most beautiful light on earth. We start shooting very early in the morning and stop as soon as the sun goes down.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A magician arrives and sits at Michael&#39;s table, holding a pack of cards. &quot;Pick a card and write your name on it&quot;, he tells the star. Michael is slightly startled. He picks a three of clubs and marks it with a black cross. The magician shuffles the pack of cards and pulls the right one out. &quot;Is this your card?&quot;, he asks. &quot;That&#39;s wonderful!&quot;, laughs Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then it&#39;s souvenir snap time for the lucky winners, and they gather round the star while the photographer shoots. Michael smiles, nods a lot, and shakes hands once more. And suddenly, he is led away from us by one of the bodyguards. Almost reluctantly, he follows him to his car. But before we have time to realize what&#39;s happening, the black limousine has vanished into the dark. The party&#39;s over and as the DJ plays Louis Armstrong&#39;s &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, there is a lot of sobbing and eyes are filled with tears. Michael has gone!</span></p></body>
