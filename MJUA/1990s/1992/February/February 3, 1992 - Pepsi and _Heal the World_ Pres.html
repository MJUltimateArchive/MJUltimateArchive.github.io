I&rsquo;d like to thank the Pepsi-Cola International for sponsoring the &lsquo;Dangerous Tour,&rsquo; which we plan to kick off in June. The only reason I am going on tour is to raise funds for the newly formed &lsquo;Heal The World,&rsquo; an international children&rsquo;s charity that I am spearheading to assist children and the ecology. My goal is to gross $100 million by Christmas 1993. I urge every corporation and individual who cares about this planet and the future of the children to help raise money for the &lsquo;Heal The World&rsquo; charity. The Heal The World&rsquo; foundation will contribute funds to paediatric AIDS in honor of my friend Ryan White. The &lsquo;Heal The World&rsquo; foundation will also offer support to such worthwhile organizations as &lsquo;Camp Ronald McDonald,&rsquo; &lsquo;Make A Wish&rsquo; foundation, &lsquo;Children Diabetes,&rsquo; &lsquo;Minority AIDS&rsquo; foundation and other charities. I&rsquo;m looking forward to this tour because it will allow me to devote time to visiting children all around the world, as well as spread the message of global love in the hopes that others, too, will be moved to do their share to help &lsquo;Heal The World.&rsquo; Thank you for coming. I love you very much, and thank you all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/339589154/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;UPI&rdquo; (February 4, 1992)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200218180800/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/339589154/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pepsi-Cola International, the international division of PepsiCo Inc., said Monday it has signed its third sponsorship agreement with superstar singer Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The deal, which Pepsi claims is the largest sponsorship agreement between a corporation and a music entertainer, will cover 18 months and a substantial element will include an international tour by Jackson to Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No dollar figure was given on the deal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;He continues to have an enormous following internationally among teens,&#39; said Peter Kendall, vice president of worldwide marketing for Pepsi-Cola International. &#39;And that&#39;s just the audience we&#39;re trying to reach.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The tour will begin in Europe in the summer and will promote Jackson&#39;s first album in four years, Pepsi said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Previous tours, sponsored by Pepsi, and several commercials in which Jackson appeared on behalf of the beverage company, &#39;made an enormous impact on our businesses worldwide,&#39; Kendall said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In addition to the new Pepsi commercials, the deal will combine the production of radio spots as well as print, point-of-sale materials and outdoor advertising. Pepsi also will be involved in promoting Jackson&#39;s tour through television and radio specials.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pepsi said as part of the sponsorship agreement the company will help Jackson raise funds for his new foundation venture designed to provide aid and support for children throughout the world. The foundation &ldquo;Heal the World,&rdquo; will be kicked off with a contribution from Pepsi of $100,000, the company said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/04/arts/michael-jackson-and-pepsi-in-new-deal.html"><span class="cs8567212B">New York Times (February 4, 1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hot on the heels of the premiere of his latest video, &quot;Remember the Time,&quot; Michael Jackson yesterday announced a new deal with Pepsi-Cola International, a world tour this year and the establishment of a Heal the World foundation to help underprivileged children around the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After descending the opulent staircase at Radio City Music Hall to the accompaniment of his song &quot;Black or White,&quot; Mr. Jackson joined Pepsi-Cola in announcing the international deal, which the company said was the largest ever between a corporation and a music entertainer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dressed in black leather and a red armband, Mr. Jackson said his only reason for undertaking the tour was to &quot;spread the message of global love in the hopes that others, too, will be moved to do their share to help heal the world.&quot; He said he hoped the tour would gross $100 million for the foundation by Christmas 1993.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When asked how much money the singer would receive, Peter Kendall, Pepsi&#39;s vice president for worldwide marketing, said only, &quot;A lot.&quot; Later, a spokeswoman for Pepsi-Cola International said the company had a policy of not discussing financial details.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pepsi-Cola International said its deal with Mr. Jackson would cover 18 months and would involve his appearances in Pepsi commercials, as well as a tour of Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America. The schedule has yet to be determined, but Mr. Kendall said the tour would probably begin in Britain in June or July. The United States is not on the itinerary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last year Mr. Jackson signed a contract with Sony worth at least $30 million, with an interest in profits from new albums, including his latest, &quot;Dangerous.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Jackson&#39;s video &quot;Remember the Time&quot; -- nine minutes long and set in ancient Egypt, with a cast that includes Eddie Murphy and Magic Johnson -- is set to a song from the &quot;Dangerous&quot; album, which was released in November on Sony&#39;s Epic label. The video was broadcast on Sunday night on Fox Television, MTV and Black Entertainment Television. When the video of &quot;Black or White&quot; was broadcast in November, it gave Fox its highest overnight Nielsen ratings ever, an 18.4 rating and a 27 share. A Fox spokeswoman said yesterday that &quot;Remember the Time&quot; weighed in overnight with a 14 rating and 19 share.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The company also sponsored Mr. Jackson&#39;s &quot;Bad&quot; tour in 1988 and his &quot;Victory&quot; tour in 1984.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pepsi-Cola International said it would help Mr. Jackson launch and raise money for his foundation and would sponsor special fund-raising concerts in Eastern Europe and India.

That is the most important thing, so they would love to get someone who will speak for them and speak out about their issues. We think Michael is a great person to do this.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs95E872D0"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
