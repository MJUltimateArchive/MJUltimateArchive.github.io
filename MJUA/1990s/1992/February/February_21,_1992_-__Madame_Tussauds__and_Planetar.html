A newspaper reported that he liked the idea of being a lord of the manor. But his spokesman, Jonathan Morrish, tells &quot;BIG!&quot;, that Michael laughed at the story and definitely has no plans to buy a castle!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">4:30pm: Michael visited the Walt Disney Shop in Regent Street. He spent about 10 minutes there but had to leave through a back door due to the commotion from the crowd outside. But &quot;BIG!&quot; can exclusively reveal that he returned after the shop had closed at 7:15 pm! &quot;He was very relaxed and seemed to have fun while he was here&quot;, shop assistant Stuart Roberts tells &quot;BIG!&quot;. &quot;He was quiet, but very friendly. He spoke to me about the products and chose everything himself. He said he&#39;d like to pop back in the summer.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">5pm: Michael arrived at his favorite London attraction, Madame Tussauds, for his fifth visit! Michael took his mom there in 1988 and this time, he took Brett, showing him all his favorite waxworks, including Sleeping Beauty and Tom Thumb. He looked around the workshops where the models are made before seeing the new waxwork of himself! &quot;He was delighted with it&quot;, says Juliet Simpkins, who accompanied him. &quot;He looked at it very closely, and then smiled and did a little jig next to it. He was very pleased!&quot; Michael and Brett stopped for coffee and then had a go on the rifle range in Madame Tussauds. &quot;He was a good shot&quot;, laughs Juliet. &quot;He seemed really cheerful the whole time he was here. He was very chatty!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A"><a class="cs8048ECCE" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103755/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dangerousreviewspart2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Smash Hits&rdquo;</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">21 February</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Friday Afternoon</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gets mobbed outside The Dorchester and falls over in the street. Some fan pinches a red jersey off him for a souvenir. The police escort her off &ldquo;mainly for his own safety&rdquo; and pinch the jersey back and send it to the hotel. Some bloke from Warner Brothers arrives dressed up as Bugs Bunny--the goon--and presents Michael with loads of Warner cartoon videos which he couldn&rsquo;t find yesterday. PM Dawn arrive and attempt to gain an &ldquo;audience&rdquo; with him but fail. They leave a note instead.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Friday night</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Goes to Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s, followed by one million journalists and photographers who he manages to shake off before he gets there. Except for the &ldquo;Hits&rdquo;, who&rsquo;ve had a tip off and get to the waxworks before he does! Runs in covering his nose with a book. Stays for an hour. He&rsquo;s been here before, of course, once with The Jackson 5 when he was 15; then in 1985 to unveil his first wax &ldquo;figure&rdquo;, then twice in 1988, once for a private visit and once with his mum. His statue&rsquo;s in the &ldquo;Superstar&rdquo; section, alongside Joan Collins, Cher, Eddie Murphy, Michael Caine, and Sylvester Stallone. This time, Michael gets very excited about the Roger Rabbit and Mr. T waxworks. He goes right up to his own waxwork for a close inspection and does a bit of the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; dance routine. Then he takes Brett to the cafe bit where they have a go on a shooting range and shoot some [lobsters?] etc. Oh dear. For some reason, Michael never [illegible] up the whole time he&rsquo;s here. He and Brett help themselves to some pick n&rsquo; mix sweeties and Michael asks for some T-shirts, a guide book, and a book on the history of the exhibition. They have a quick look at the Planetarium and a new exhibition called Space Trail, featuring a demonstration on how a black hole works where you get to twiddle some knobs. So, Michael does. For ages. Then they all sneak out a side door into a black mini-coach thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103755/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/dangerousreviewspart2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown newspaper snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael&rsquo;s] unannounced return last night caught security staff on the hop and threw fans into a frenzy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As 50 screaming youngsters surrounded his black Ford Scorpio, one jumped into the car and snatched his red designer sweater.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the star tried to walk the 20 yards to the hotel, he was crushed by a sea of bodies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Friend] Brett held his face in horror as the bodyguards pushed the pair up steps to revolving doors.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson fell to his knees before he was virtually thrown into the foyer and made his way to the [illegible].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fan Adrian Nicholas said: &quot;The poor bloke was getting crushed--it certainly wasn&#39;t an easy ride.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Capital Radio reporter Adrian Nicholas said: &quot;It was absolute bedlam.
