They didn&#39;t care that there would be no singing or dancing by the man who NABOB Chairman Pierre Sutton described as having &quot;revolutionized and dominated contemporary music, dance, video and fashion&rdquo;. They just wanted to be in </span><span class="cs43C038A">the </span><span class="csD5D7D290">place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Squeezing into the packed reception entrance hall-exchanging how-to-do&#39;s with one another-in the nation&#39;s capital were a legion of celebrities in their own right. Rev, Jesse Jackson came with his youngest daughter Jacqueline, who is a self-described &ldquo;ultimate fan&quot; of Michael Jackson. Entertainers Stevie Wonder, Al Jarreau, and Stacey Lattisaw, boxing heavyweights Muhammad Ali, and Leon Spinks (along with promoter Butch Lewis), as well as movie heavyweights Spike Lee, and Robert Townsend rubbed elbows with other NABOB honorees Motown President Jheril Busby, BET President Robert Johnson, Sen, Bill Bradley (D., NJ.) and Rep, Bill Richardson (D., N.M.).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award, Jackson thanked Black Sony/Epic music executive Hank Caldwell, recognized the other honorees who were not present and NABOB for supporting his musical career. &ldquo;This award is great,&rdquo; said Jackson, holding the plaque.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You (NABOB) were there from the beginning and I feel in my heart that you&#39;ll always be there.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And with Jackson as the drawing card, the association had the rare opportunity of mass media appeal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/453062746/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Associated Press&rdquo; (March 7, 1992)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The ever-quiet Michael Jackson was downright wordy Thursday night when he accepted a lifetime achievement award from the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters here Thursday.
