Somebody was able to get the mother and the other child but the baby was drowned. Michael read about it and he immediately went down to Long Beach and everybody was waiting for the funeral and the father came back and saw all the trouble he caused and in a way was responsible for his son&rsquo;s death or whatever someone said, &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t this funeral started?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;The person paying for it hasn&rsquo;t gotten here yet&rdquo;. About that time, up came a limo and who stepped out? Michael.</span></p></body>
