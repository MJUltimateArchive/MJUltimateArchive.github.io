Welcome to Prime Time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Glad you&rsquo;re here. It occurs to me, looking at the two of you, I have got to start, by asking, how this marriage took place, how it began. Let me guess that it was not over miniature golf and a hot dog, or something. When did it start? When was the dating?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, we first met, she was seven years old and I was seventeen. This was in Las Vegas. She used to come and see my show all the time. We had the only family show on the strip, the Jackson 5. And, she used to come, as a little girl, and sit right up front. She came quite often. She came with a lot of bodyguards. And &hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Had you stayed in touch with her?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Sure, sure. And then she&rsquo;d come backstage, then I&rsquo;d, you know, talk and say hi and then she&rsquo;d come again. And I thought she was sweet, and loving, and I hoped , I always hoped I&rsquo;d see her again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And who first talked about marriage?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We didn&rsquo;t stay in touch&hellip;after that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We didn&rsquo;t stay in touch after that, no.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He, he&hellip;go ahead, you wannted to say it. Go ahead.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, you can say it. You can, you have a good memory.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie : </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, you said you were going to say it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Our first argument here, um, this hour. Who, who proposed? I mean, how did marriage actually get discussed?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, well, at first this is what happened. When she was 18, I used to tell my lawyer, John Branca: do you know Lisa-Marie Presley? He&rsquo;d go, well, I represent her mother.I&rsquo;d go, well, can you get in touch with her, &rsquo;cause, I think she&rsquo;s really cute. And he&rsquo;d laugh everytime. He goes, I&rsquo;ll try my best, that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d say. Then he&rsquo;d come back and I said&hellip;well did you find out? He said, no, there&rsquo;s nothing. So I would worry him about this all the time. The next thing I noticed, there was a picture on a magazine cover where she&rsquo;s married, which really tore me to pieces, because I felt that was supposed to be me, I really did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And what, what was the countdown to your marriage? Tell me, who said the word marriage first?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When? Where?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When, where?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> On the telephone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh yeah, oh yeah on the telephone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He first asked me, we were dating now for four months&hellip;right? Four months?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&rsquo;t remember.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Anyway, we were spending a lot of time together. I don&rsquo;t know how it didn&rsquo;t manage to get in the press, because we weren&rsquo;t hiding it. I was in Las Vegas, we were in&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJ and LM : </span><span class="csD5D7D290">We were everywhere together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Everywhere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Went to bookstores,&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> To bookstores. We were not hiding it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And you said </span><span class="cs43C038A">yes</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> right away?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was separated for four months now, and he said: &ldquo;What would you do if I asked you, to marry me?&rdquo; And I said, I would.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> A big </span><span class="cs43C038A">I would,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> you were really enthusiastic! [giggling]&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I have to ask you this, because I can only imagine there are a number of lawyers involved in a pre-nuptual agreement, between these two fortunes. Is there one? A careful one?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, we&rsquo;ve worked out things and we&rsquo;ve signed certain things but, of course&hellip;that&rsquo;s very confidential.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We agreed, we made agreements prior, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> As you know, the reaction to this marriage, and I know you feel strongly about it, but the reaction to this marriage has been across the spectrum, everything from astonishment, to delight, to . . .suspicion. That it was somehow . . .too convenient. Lisa, did you ask Michael about the charges? Did the two of you think about the impact, of the marriage, on the allegations?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Absolutely not. He called&hellip;I was in touch with him through the whole process of this, charges going on. I was talking to him when he disappeared. I was actually supposed to go to Santa Juan, Puerto Rico, when he left and disappeared, and I got a call that he wasn&rsquo;t going to be there, and I was actually part of the whole thing with him, by talking to him on the phone. So&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you say to him: &ldquo;Are they true?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I didn&rsquo;t. No&hellip;I actually did not.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I want to take a minute here, and I&rsquo;m gonna come back to the marriage&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Could I just&hellip;sorry. He, he, went, on and on and on about it, so I didn&rsquo;t really have to say, &ldquo;Are the allegations true?&rdquo; He was </span><span class="cs43C038A">gggrrr</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [imitating Michael&rsquo;s outrage] on the phone, y&rsquo;know, and &hellip;..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Over and over.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Just constant&hellip;yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, [turning to Michael] because I know that you&rsquo;ve wanted to express similar sentiments for a long time, I want to ask a few things about the charges. But first I want to establish for the viewers here, there are no ground rules. You have said to me you are not afraid of any questions. So, I wanted that understood by everybody before we proceed. I think I want to begin by making sure that the terms are clear. You have said you would never harm a child. I want to be as specific as I can. Did you ever, as this young boy said you did, did you ever sexually engage, fondle, have sexual contact with this child, or any other child?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Never, ever. I could never harm a child, or anyone. It&rsquo;s not in my heart, it&rsquo;s not who I am. And it&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m&hellip;..I&rsquo;m not even interested in that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And what do you think should be done to someone who does that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> To someone who does that? What I think should be done? Gee . . .I think they need help . . .in some kind of way . . .you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How about the police photographs, though? How was there enough information from this boy about those kinds of things?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The police photographs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The police photographs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That they took of me? &hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There was nothing that matched me to those charges, there was nothing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There was nothing they could connect to him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sitting here talking to you today. There was not one iota of information that was found, that could connect me &hellip;..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So when we&rsquo;ve heard the charges&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There was nothing&hellip;&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &hellip;markings of some kind?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No markings.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No markings?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why did you settle the&hellip;..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why am I still here then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&rsquo;re not going to ask me about them, are you? [laughing] Sorry. About the markings?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You volunteered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I&rsquo;m just&hellip;.the point is, is that when that finally got concluded that there was no match-up, then, it was printed this big [showing a tiny area], as opposed to how big it was, what the match-up was supposed to be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Because it isn&rsquo;t so!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why did you settle the case then?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The whole thing is a lie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Why did you settle the case? And, it looks to everyone as if you paid a huge amount of money&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That&rsquo;s&hellip;that&rsquo;s, most of that&rsquo;s folklore. I talked to my lawyers, and I said, &ldquo;can you guarantee me, that justice will prevail?&rdquo; And they said: &ldquo;Michael, we cannot guarantee you that a judge, or a jury will do anything.&rdquo; And with that I was like catatonic, I was outraged!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How much money&hellip;..</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Totally outraged. So, I said&hellip;I have got to do something to get out from under this nightmare. All these lies and all these people coming forth to get paid and all these tabloid shows, just lies, lies, lies, lies. So what I did, we got together again with my advisors and they advised me. It was a hands down, unanimous decision &ndash; resolve the case. This could be something that could go on for seven years!&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How much money was&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> We said, let&rsquo;s get it behind us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Can you say how much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It&rsquo;s not what the tabloids have printed. It&rsquo;s not all this crazy outlandish money, no, it&rsquo;s not at all. I mean, the terms of the agreement are very confidential.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I want to ask &hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He&rsquo;s been barred to discuss it. The, the&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The specific terms &hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The specific terms</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Of the agreement.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Lisa Marie:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The specific amounts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The idea, it just isn&rsquo;t fair&hellip;what they put me through. &lsquo;Cause there wasn&rsquo;t one piece of information that says I did that. And anyway, they turned my room upside-down, went through all my books, all my videotapes, all my private things, and they found nothing, nothing, nothing that could say Michael Jackson did this. Nothing!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> But let me ask you a couple of questions&hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> To this day, nothing. Still, nothing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Let me ask you &hellip;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Nothing, nothing, nothing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Nothing. We got nothing. As you may or may not know, we have called everyone we could call, we have checked everything we can check, we have gone and tried to see if what we heard before is in fact the case&hellip;I want to ask you about two things. These reports that we read over and over again, that in your room they found photographs of young boys&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Not of young boys, of children, all kinds of girls and . . . everything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And that they found photographs&hellip;books, of young boys who were undressed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Noooo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Diane Sawyer:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It didn&rsquo;t happen?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No. Not that I know of, unless people sent me things that I haven&rsquo;t opened. People send, people know my love for children, so they send me books from all over the world.

I can hear out in the country people saying &ndash; and you&rsquo;ve been cleared of all the charges, I want to make that clear.

I have never invited anyone into my bed, ever. Children love me, I love them. They follow me, they want to be with me.

But, somehow, people still&hellip;are not, they don&rsquo;t feel they&rsquo;ve heard everything about the whiteness of your skin, and that its not somehow a choice on your part , along with the make-up&hellip;to be. Is it to be&hellip;neither black, or white&hellip;neither&hellip;to look completely male, to be in the androgynous zone? I, I think they wanna know&hellip;it is a decision, on your part in some way, the way you look.
