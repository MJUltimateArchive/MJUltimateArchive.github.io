I mean it. Thank you. Thank you, Morgan for your words. Thank you VH1, thank you for this honor. Thank you all my friends and fans for your love and support. You&#39;ve given me some much, it allowed me to take some of that love and pass it on to those people whose problems in this world need and deserve our help. A perfect example is the recent UN announcement that up to 3 million lives could be saved if Third World children were given a Vitamin A pill three times a year. Cost per child is just six cents, that&#39;s all. So we must join together in healing the world so we can share this beautiful planet in joy and love. I love you very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;VH1 International Honors Award&rdquo; inscription</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The power of music is the power of the soul.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">VH1 honors the musician who goes beyond sharing the soul and shares time, energy and resources to help others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-24/entertainment/ca-16654_1_michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (June 24, 1995)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160817220543/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-24/entertainment/ca-16654_1_michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though he was on stage for less time than any other star at the VH1 Honors awards ceremony Thursday night, Michael Jackson still managed to take home the most prestigious trophy and, predictably, steal the limelight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was among the six honorees at the second annual event at the Shrine Auditorium, a program that refreshingly skips your usual &quot;best of&quot; categories and recognizes musical entities for their charity work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Also saluted were Whitney Houston, Bette Midler, Boyz II Men, Smokey Robinson, Annie Lennox, Vince Gill and the Red Hot Organization.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But they each just received a plain old VH1 Honors Award.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was honored with the brand-new &quot;VH1 International Honors Award,&quot; the terms of which weren&#39;t really clear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You&#39;ve given me so much, it&#39;s allowed me to take some of that love and pass it on to people whose problems in this world need and deserve our love,&quot; Jackson said during his brief acceptance speech.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The remarks followed Jackson&#39;s grandiose, surprise entrance, in which he came up from under the stage floor during Boyz II Men&#39;s performance of &quot;We Are the World,&quot; the &#39;80s charitable anthem that Jackson co-wrote.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While the other performers honored Thursday sang at least two full songs, Jackson only joined in for the final 15 seconds or so of the one song, took his award, and vanished.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This left room for the numerous musical highlights of the evening, most of which featured duets by the honorees and special guests.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;One of the things I&#39;ve most looked forward to tonight was getting together and singing with friends,&quot; Houston said when she received her award for creating the Whitney Houston Foundation for Children. She then went into a soulful, tearful version of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; with CeCe Winans.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Houston was also one of the many, including Boyz II Men, Gill and Wynonna Judd, that kicked off the telecast with a series of Robinson&#39;s songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lennox was the queen of the stage, though, displaying chameleon-like vocal talents with Robinson on his &quot;Tracks of My Tears,&quot; and, then, with Herbie Hancock on Cole Porter&#39;s &quot;Ev&#39;ry Time We Say Goodbye.&quot; Other duets included Midler with Judd, and Gill with Mary Chapin Carpenter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating presented Gill with his award for helping victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. Other charity projects honored were Lennox&#39;s involvement with the Rokpa Trust, Boyz II Men with Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, Robinson with the United Negro College Fund, Midler for the creation of the Manhattan Restoration Project.</span></p></body>
