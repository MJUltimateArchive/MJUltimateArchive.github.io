His hair was tied back and he appeared healthy and in good spirits.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His unbilled appearance came at the conclusion of a promotional program by his record company, Epic, which previewed five new songs from the singer&rsquo;s long-overdue new album &ldquo;HIStory Book I.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now scheduled for a spring release, the 150-minute double album will consist of a greatest-hits disc and a disc of new material. Prior to his appearance, excerpts were played from the five new songs -- &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stranger in Moscow,&rdquo; &ldquo;They Don&rsquo;t Care About Us,&rdquo; &ldquo;Earth Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scream,&rdquo; a high-powered duet with his sister Janet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, who usually limits his public speaking to a sentence or two at best, addressed the audience for nearly two minutes. Most of his comments were about his forthcoming album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;For over 20 years now we have created magic (and) history in breaking new ground, which is something we will also do with `HIStory Book I.&rsquo; My heartfelt thanks to my Epic (Records) family . . . you guys really know how to make things happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I appreciate this very much. All my love. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the crowd applauded, Epic honcho David Glew whispered in the singer&rsquo;s ear. &quot;(He) just told me to tell you something about the new album,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before the singer could continue, Glew grabbed the microphone from him and declared that the still-uncompleted album was &ldquo;absolutely amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While Jackson&rsquo;s Convention Center appearance occurred under heavy security, he earlier spent several hours at a downtown San Diego bookstore, where he browsed for nearly two hours and bought several boxes of mostly out-of-print books. Jackson, who wore a red satin surgical mask, was accompanied by several bodyguards and by his wife, who did not appear at the Convention Center gathering.</span></p></body>
