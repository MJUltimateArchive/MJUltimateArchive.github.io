This scene has also been recreated by other artists, most notably by Henrietta Rae. You will find photos of both these works on this website. The painting depicts a moment in Greek mythology where Hylas is lured into the spring by the nymphs. Notice the nymph pulling Michael by the arm and into the spring. Michael and Brett chose to recreate this magical and mythical scene due to Michael&#39;s own persona of peace and love. It is as if Michael saw himself in Greek mythology and immortality. What has been perceived to be a controversial painting is in fact a magical and romantic masterpiece of such depths few have understood until now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://loversportrait.com/"><span class="cs8567212B">painting collector&rsquo;s painting office listing</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Art and music are timeless. As it crosses cultural boundries, whether in words or in images, art has the power to speak the dreams of a generation. This power must be cherished, shared, respected, and above all, used for worthwhile endeavors. I am gratified to have affiliated with Brett Strong. He, like Michelangelo, is gifted, and like that great Renaissance artist, is a dynamic visionary.</span></p></body>
