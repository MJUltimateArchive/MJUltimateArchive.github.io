Everything has a unique twist. But, the one that ranks at the top is probably Michael Jackson &quot;You Are Not Alone.&quot; We had planned out all these elements for the video and then Michael had this idea where he wanted to use this Greek, classical-styled, artistic imagery. And, he wanted to appear in it naked with his wife, Lisa Marie Presley. Like they were Greek gods. It had nothing to do with the video we were doing, but I said, &quot;OK, that&#39;s cool. We can shoot it.&quot; We set it up and as we&#39;re ready to shoot, he leads me into the trailer and says, &quot;Have you asked her?&quot; He wanted me to ask her to appear in the video. He was too shy. So I asked. And we did it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">1998 Black and White Magazine</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The warmth displayed in the You Are Not Alone video is for real. The shots in the last scene were done without Michael and Lisa Marie knowing it, literally off-camera. Michael never at any point indicated that this was a marketing thing. It was more personal than that. The nude scenes were Michael&#39;s idea. I thought it was ballsy and honnest; you can&#39;t get any more open than that. They&#39;re saying, Here we are, you want to see us? I didn&#39;t look at it as a marketing thing. I thought it was a statement.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The funny thing about my relation with Michael is that I did one of my first jobs serving as an electrician on the Billie Jean video!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was great to work with. When you actually talk to Michael he really is a normal guy; there&#39;s just a lot of layers to go through. And Lisa&#39;s got a great sense of humor. They&#39;re both no-nonsense kind of people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Daniel Pearl, cinematographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/moviegeeksunited/2009/06/28/mike-medavoy-michael-jackson-cinematographer-danie"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Movie Geeks United&quot; (June 28, 2009) [starts at 56:14]</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We&#39;re about to do this video, we&#39;re summoned to a meeting with Michael, we&#39;re gonna go to Stan Winston... he was sitting Michael for some angel wings, they don&rsquo;t really appear in &ldquo;You Are Not Alone&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think, but anyhow we were gonna shoot him with some angel wings on his back. &nbsp;So we were called to a meeting there, [and] Michael&#39;s going to have a word with myself, as the cinematographer, the cameraman. He wanted the AD (Assistant Director) there, he wanted the producer there, he wanted the director there... So we went to the meeting, and as we&#39;re going into the meeting, [the person leading us to the meeting] said, &quot;Ok, you won&#39;t look at him and you won&#39;t speak to him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I thought to myself, &quot;What kind of meeting is this?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As we came in the door, I didn&#39;t look at him, I looked down at the floor. And I said, &quot;Michael, you may remember me, I&#39;m Daniel Pearl, I shot &#39;Billie Jean&#39; and then I shot &#39;Give In To Me&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He goes, &quot;You shot &#39;Give In To Me&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He goes, &quot;He knows exactly what to do, everybody, meeting&#39;s over.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We did stick around for another couple of minutes, but basically he felt confident that I would do a good job on him, make him look good. Basically, everything was gonna be ok. He felt that everybody understood and respected his wishes, and we were gonna take good care of him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, we go and we shoot him. First thing we did is we shot him in the theater. This theater, I must say... alot of people, including one of my very good friends Hype Williams, believe that that theater is CGI, that it&#39;s too pretty to be real, it is not... I had a very good friend from film school at the University of Texas who was my chief lighting engineer, a guy named Jim Bogard, it was his last job and may have been some of his finest work that he ever did. Let it suffice to say, it is a real theater, we did light it, it was there...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After that, the next thing we were supposed to shoot was Michael on a green screen, and we had painted one of the biggest three-wall cycloramas in Hollywood green, and lit the entire thing. And we had a motion-controlled camera in there, the idea was we were gonna shoot several sequences... In the case of &#39;You Are Not Alone&#39;, he&#39;s put in the Grand Canyon, he&#39;s put in the Mojave Desert, he&#39;s put in different places. Also, he&#39;s put in the paparazzi, where he&#39;s walking along the paparazzi in that scene, and with the flashbulbs going off. One of the flashbulbs, while we were shooting, had actually exploded with a loud &quot;pop&quot; that sounded quite like a gun. Michael doubled over at the waist when that went off, and my initial reaction is, &quot;Oh my God.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I thought he had been shot. Fortunately, nothing like that happened, that wasn&#39;t the case at all. But, at this point, he was really not wanting to be around any more people than needed to be. So, anyhow, he chose not to show up the day we were supposed to shoot the green screen, and he notified us about four or five hours into the day that he wasn&#39;t coming. So Wayne Isham, the director, and myself, we were able to get time at the telecine where we were working on the film. We were gonna transfer this footage to videotape for the edit, to do that with one of today&#39;s well-known top colorists, a guy named Stefan Sonnenfeld, and we went there right away and we put up the footage that we&#39;d shot on Michael in the Pantages Theatre the day or two before.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I should say that I lit for quite some time to make Michael&#39;s face flawless, I lit out every unwanted fold and crease and what-have-you; I lit everything out. A lot of light bounced off the white cards... in a way, it&#39;s like frosting a cake for a cameraman when you light in this style, you&#39;re just basically reflecting and bouncing white back into the face. You just drive light into all the problem areas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyhow, when the first footage came up, I went, &quot;Oh my God, I cannot tell if he is male or female. I cannot tell, the person I&#39;m looking at. What&#39;s their gender? Oh my God, what is gonna happen to me?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well, we go ahead and we do it... At this point, now it&#39;s four days later, he comes to the shoot in the green screen, he so doesn&#39;t want anybody around him now, that, at this point, he&#39;s issued a command that Raleigh Studios, there&#39;s about 18 various different sound-stages there, all the stages when he goes from his RV to his studio, all the other stages are gonna be under lock-down. Nobody will be allowed to go in or out of those stages, the other ones, &#39;til he gets into our stage. When he gets in there, only allowing myself, the chief lighting technician, in case he has to adjust any lighting in the gaffer - Jim Bogard in this case, the grip, the guy basically who&#39;s responsible for moving the camera - we do have a motion controlled rig there but we have levers to enable us to [human encode?] the movement of the camera as he moves around the stage... move the cameras to pursue him, or whatever, to compose him as he moves around. I have remote control gear wheels - pan and tilt wheels - to pan and tilt the camera, and the assistant is also allowed in there to pull focus and to work the zoom lens as need be. The director&#39;s not allowed in, the AD&#39;s not allowed in. It&#39;s one of the biggest stages in Hollywood, there&#39;s only the four--myself and three crew members--and Michael and one security guy come in to this room. The director, the producer, everyone else, the vanity departments--the hair, wardrobe, makeup, etc.--all are getting a video feed from our film camera and they&#39;re in another room; they&#39;ve hung a microphone in the middle of this big space that we&#39;re sort of yelling to to speak to them, and they&#39;re speaking back to us over a microphone and speaker system in the room. Well, Michael comes walking into the room with his one security guy, and he starts speaking, and I&#39;m looking around. Who&#39;s he speaking to? I&#39;m looking around. Who&#39;s in here? I mean, there&#39;s nobody in here. Who in the world is he speaking to? And then as I&#39;m looking around, looking around, he goes, &quot;No Daniel, it&#39;s ok, I&#39;m speaking to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He goes, &quot;I have to tell you something. I&#39;ve just seen that footage. I never, ever dreamed that I could look like that. From now on, you can speak to me.&quot; (laughs)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Movie Geeks United: There&#39;s a lot of shots in there with his wife at the time. What was that experience like shooting the two of them together?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Daniel Pearl: Well, that was very interesting. I&#39;ve been asked this question many times, &quot;Was she actually topless at the time?&quot; and she was. That&#39;s a question that&#39;s often asked. She was very cool to work with, he was very much in love with her at the time, and he was very protective of [her], and to make sure that she was dealt with properly, that it wasn&#39;t all about him, it was to be about the two of them. He was very into her, basically spent alot of time, and some of the shots that are in there are actually shots we grabbed when they didn&#39;t even know we were rolling, you know [inaudible] that they were interacting on that level.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Tonya Watt, Debbie Rowe&#39;s Friend, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=44924892&amp;blogId=375534192"><span class="cs8567212B">Myspace Blog</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So She took me to Gower Studio where he was shooting a music video. He works at night so we went around 11pm. I was so nervous (only he and Dolly would make me nervous).. We arrivedand his body guards led us to a trailer. She went in and left me outside of the trailer for a while. Finally, she opened the door and called me in.. She said &ldquo;Michael this is Tonya Tonya this is Michael&rdquo;. he shook my hand.. and I said the dumbest shit ever&hellip; &rdquo; &ldquo;should I faint now or later&rdquo; giggle giggle.. He then said &ldquo;listen to her laugh.&rdquo;. so I sat in the corner in a chair while she, Michael and the makeup artist all carry on while he is getting his makeup done&hellip; not many people can say they have done that.. he is very private about his make up affairs ha ha</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Off to the set we went&hellip; I was so shy and trailed behind.. He stopped and waited on me.. Such a gentleman.. We did go in his personal trailer and there was candy all over the place..just as I would have imagined . We soon had to leave cuz Lisa Marie was on her way. She was in that video and well, it was time to go..</span></p></body>
