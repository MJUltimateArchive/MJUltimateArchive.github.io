It is a Greatest Hits album - to me most Greatest Hits Albums are boring, you know, and I wanted to keep creating. You know, the new songs are very different. They are autobiographical, I mean they came from the heart - they are myself. They are not my songs anymore, it&#39;s the way I feel they belong to everybody now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Scream:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sometimes the only thing you can do is scream. (laughs) Don&#39;t you ever feel this way? You just wanna let it all out. People should listen and decide for themselves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Childhood:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Our personal history begins in childhood and the song &quot;Childhood&quot; is a reflection of my life, years ago, when I was much younger. And it&#39;s about the pain, some of the joys, some of the dreaming, some of the mental adventures I took because of the different lifestyle that I had being a child performer. I was born on the stage and &quot;Childhood&quot; - it is my mirror - it is my story.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Earth Song:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember writing Earth Song when I was in Austria, in a hotel. And I was feeling so much pain and so much suffering of the plight of the Planet Earth. And for me, uhm, this is Earth&#39;s Song, because I think nature is trying so hard to compensate for man&#39;s mismanagement of the Earth. And with the ecological unbalance going on, and a lot of the, uh, problems in the environment, I think earth feels... feels the pain, and she has wounds, and it&#39;s about some of the joys of the planet as well. But this is my chance to pretty much let people hear the voice of the planet. And this is &quot;Earth Song&quot;. And that&#39;s what inspired it. And it just suddenly dropped into my lap when I was in... on tour in Austria.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Stranger in Moscow:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stranger in Moscow was written when I was in Moscow on the Dangerous Tour. And it was just a strange, eerie, lonely time for me. Outside my hotel was just a sea of faces of fans chanting and screaming. But I was inside my room and I felt so all alone, like I was the last person on the planet. And in the song I say, &quot;How does it feel when you&#39;re alone and you&#39;re cold inside.&quot; I say, &quot;It&#39;s like a stranger in Moscow&quot;. And that&#39;s pretty much how I felt. And the people were lovely. They were some of the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met. And the concert was very successful, but, that day, especially that day, I just felt this different feeling and the song &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot; came to me. So, that&#39;s how that was written.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">The Girl is Mine:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of my favorite songs to record of all of my recordings as a solo artist is probably &quot;The Girl is Mine&quot;, because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting. And we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing and throwing stuff at each other and making jokes. It was just a lot of fun, and we actually recorded the track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and we do have footage of it, but it&#39;s never been shown. Maybe one day we&#39;ll give you a sneak preview of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Thriller:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I think the most fun short film or video that I&#39;ve ever made had to be &quot;Thriller&quot;. I just loooooved becoming a monster (laughs) because it gave me a chance to pretty much become someone else. It was just fun hiding behind this mask and just really letting this part of you, your body or your feelings out, but hiding behind a different character. And it was just thrilling for me to make that. And the dance, and all the morphing, and all the fun things that we did...it&#39;s so memorable.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Billie Jean:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I was very little, around 10 years old, I used to go on these tours with my brothers, The Jackson Five, and I&#39;d hear these crazy stories that (laughs) these girls would claim my brothers hand relationships with the, which they didn&#39;t and that they were going to have their children. And I thought that to be so strange and so crazy. And then, a couple of years later, there was this girl, named Billie Jean, who used to stand outside my gate. And I would drive outside the gate and she would say &quot;Here&#39;s the keys to our car&quot; and she would say &quot;Here&#39;s the keys to the front door&quot; She would say that I am actually the father of her child, which never ever happened... And that inspired the song cause the chorus goes &quot;Billie Jean is not my lover, she&#39;s just the one who claims that I am the one, but the kid is not my son&quot; So, I guess that&#39;s how that happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Transcription from &ldquo;Heal the World&rdquo; audio commentary (found in July 4, 1995 videos)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Heal the World:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Heal the World&rdquo; is one of my favorites of anything I&#39;ve ever recorded, because it&#39;s a public awareness song, and it&#39;s something that I think that will live in the hearts of people for a long time, because it&#39;s about something that&#39;s very special and something that&#39;s very innocent, and something that&#39;s very important. Literally healing our planet of its wounds and its suffering, and I think it&#39;s--it&#39;s one of my favorite things to do when we&#39;re on tour. Because, on stage, we blow up this giant inflatable planet Earth right on stage, and we have all these children from different countries, and they dress in their different national attire, and we sing the song. And it&#39;s amazing to look out in the audience, and you&#39;ll literally see, like, 200,000 people holding up candles and seeing the song. It&#39;s a very spiritual experience, and I really enjoy it.</span></p></body>
