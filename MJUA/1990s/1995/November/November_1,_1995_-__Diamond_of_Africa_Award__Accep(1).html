To meet him on a day like this is an honor. What impressed me most is that he&rsquo;s a man of heart.&rdquo; He went on to say: &ldquo;Pain is something I&#39;ve been through. It&rsquo;s only fools who don&rsquo;t learn through pain. Africa has been through some difficult times. All of us are nothing more than the sum total of our past experiences. Africa is not asking for favors. She is going through a very healthy transition. I&#39;m asking you to invest. I&rsquo;m not asking you to gamble.&rdquo; The President and first lady expressed their gratitude to Jackson by presenting him with the elegant Diamond of Africa.</span></p></body>
