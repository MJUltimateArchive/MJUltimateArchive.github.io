The joint venture, with combined assets of about $500 million according to Sony, includes 251 Beatles tunes as well as songs by Mariah Carey, Willie Nelson and Babyface, but Jackson&#39;s own compositions remain separate in his MIJAC catalog maintained by Warner Chappell. Jackson&#39;s share of the deal was not disclosed, but reports said Jackson sought $100 million and settled for $90 million. A published report this week said the self-proclaimed king of pop is relatively low on cash because he has paid huge settlements to parents of boys who have accused him of molestation, while maintaining his lavish lifestyle. &#39;The merging of ATV with Sony establishes our commitment to create one of the largest music publishing ventures in the world,&#39; Jackson said in the announcement. &#39;We have been working on this for over a year and, now, with the two of us together, the sky is our only limit.&#39; Jackson&#39;s role in Sony/ATV was not specified, but a representative of his MJJ Productions said, &#39;He will be active in a decision-making capacity.&#39; Michael P. Schulhof, president and chief executive officer of Sony Corp. of America, said the joint venture is an extension of Sony&#39;s &#39;very special relationship&#39; with Jackson. &#39;Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman,&#39; Schulhof said.</span></p></body>
