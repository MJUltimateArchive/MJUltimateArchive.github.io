Daniele had been diagnosed with AIDS when he was 8 years old after it was transmitted from his biological mother, HIV-positive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Invited Daniele and his mother back stage to meet him before the show. But Daniele&rsquo;s evening was going to get even better later, as during &lsquo;Heal The World&rsquo;, Michael went over to where he was sitting and carried him on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Also attending the show was the late Luciano Pavarotti, Giorgio Amarni and Gianni Versace, who was sadly murdered a month later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Antoinetta Parisi, adoptive mother of Daniele Parisi, &ldquo;Il Messaggero&rdquo; (July 13, 2005) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://mjthekingofpop.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/la-storia-di-daniele/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905203443/http://mjthekingofpop.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/la-storia-di-daniele/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (translated)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Daniele Parisi, a boy from Latina Italy, was diagnosed with AIDS at the age of 8. The virus was transmitted from his biological mother. He was a big fan of MJ and in 1997 when he was 14, he had the opportunity to attend a concert of the HIStory tour in Milan on June 18. Toward the end of the concert during the song Heal the World MJ went to Daniele who was sitting in a chair unable to walk due to the weakness caused by his illness. Knelt before him and filled his hands with kisses. Then he picked him up and walked to center stage posing for several photos. After this experience Daniele started to walk again, sometimes even run, eat better, gain weight but most importantly of all, he gained self-confidence to keep fighting and keep going.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately Daniele died two years later from a brain infection due to influenza. His adoptive mother later recalled &quot;Our meeting at the concert in San Siro June 18 1997 was magical and marvelous. Michael met us in his dressing room decorated in red, with a large mirror and lights around it. At that time all the negative thoughts that I had toward him disappeared, so much so that I apologized for having been swayed by rumors.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later they published their pictures on the cover of the fanzine French Black &amp; White.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Adoptive mother Antoinetta:] &quot;He was a special person and I regret not being able to see him again (I thought about surprising him at one of his concerts). He helped sick children because he had a difficult childhood. With Michael I understood that you should never judge without knowing the person and that we should not forget the good things done to those who are less fortunate.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He seemed thin and frail but he possessed sweetness and infinite humility. He wore a white shirt and black pants and his hair was loose, locks falling on his shoulders. What sight for Daniele! Michael was very attentive. He left many autographs for him and his friends in Latina. His bodyguards took him up on stage where he could watch the fantastic concert. But the best moment was when Michael took Daniele on the stage in his arms in front of 40 thousand people.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 2005 during the difficult time for Jackson the boy&#39;s mother sent him a letter of support.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Dearest Michael, I&#39;ll never forget what you did for my son, Daniele. After meeting you the doctors called it a miracle, because for some months it was like he never had AIDS. Now that justice has been done, I just wanted to express my gratitude and my happiness. Please do not allow more people to take advantage of you. I know that you are a person with a good heart and want to help everyone but not all people deserve so much attention. My child is not here with us anymore but I know that from up there he&#39;s always looking over you. He never forgot what you did for him. God bless you.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s response to Antonietta (the mother):</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Thank you for your letter. May God always bless you and Daniele.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Daniele said &quot;Michael is the kindest person. I remember he had a particular and sweet scent so I thought I don&#39;t want to wash myself anymore. I want to wear his scent for the rest of my life. It was like a dream for me. I remember his scent, the flashlights of photographers and my mother with the camera around her neck, so deeply moved that she wasn&#39;t able to take a single picture all day.&quot;</span></p></body>
