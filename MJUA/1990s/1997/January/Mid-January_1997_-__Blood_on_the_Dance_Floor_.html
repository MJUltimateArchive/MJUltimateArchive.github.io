In the meantime, not having heard Bottrell&rsquo;s finished version Michael wrote his own song, and asked Bottrell if it was OK to use the title.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Teddy Riley had already produced the grooves for the unnamed song in June 1990 after he learned of a friend&rsquo;s death at a party he was supposed to have been at. Michael had invited him to bring his best work to the studio in January 1991. After hearing the song, Michael went away and wrote the medley.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first version of Blood On The Dance Floor included the lyrics from the first verse of &lsquo;Sunset Driver&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Title track of Michael&rsquo;s solo album, subtitled &lsquo;History In The Mix&rsquo;, issued in May 1997. Album opened with five previously unreleased songs, followed by eight remixed songs from Michael&rsquo;s HISTORY album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Originally recorded for Michael&rsquo;s DANGEROUS album in 1991, but failed to make the final track listing. Teddy Riley, reportedly, was angry Michael didn&rsquo;t call him to &lsquo;vacuum clean this old master&rsquo; &ndash; that is, to give the song a more current sound, before its inclusion on BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finalised in January 1997 in Montreux, Switzerland &ndash; Michael played it to some fans that were outside the recording studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some formats of the single release carried the dedication: &lsquo;Dedicated to Elton John. Thank you for everything. I love you&rsquo; &ndash; an acknowledgement to Elton from Michael, for putting him up and supporting him, following his troubles in late 1993.</span></p></body>
