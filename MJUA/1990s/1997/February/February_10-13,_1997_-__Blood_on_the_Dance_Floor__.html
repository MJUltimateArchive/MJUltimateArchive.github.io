He had just been to South America, working on &quot;Evita&quot;, so he had alot of these sort of South American movements in his repertoire and things that he had seen, and been inspired by, and he wanted to bring that to Michael, which I don&#39;t think he&#39;d really done before, and he had found this little dance called [cun-shen-geh?]... and that was the base of what we created for &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;. Vince had been offered which song he wanted to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">The MJCast</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Oh wow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Stea</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Originally, he&#39;d been offered &quot;Jam&quot;, and his idea was fantastic! It was amazing, but then they went with something that was more pop-accessible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">The MJCast</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: A bit more street?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Stea</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: A bit more street. [Laughs] Vince&#39;s idea was spectacular, it was about meandering along this wall like Hamlet, and all this- It was just this amazing background of crazy images and another world, really. But yeah, not nearly as street, like it ended up being.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;, it was a lot of friends, a lot of people that I&#39;ve worked with for years and years and years. And it was also- the last day of our shooting was also the day his son was born.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">The MJCast</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Oh wow. That&#39;s a wrap [Laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Stea</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yeah, and, we didn&#39;t know this. He was there, he just seemed very distracted [Laughs]. I mean, not in a really- I didn&#39;t take it in a bad sense, but just- certainly compared to &quot;Black or White&quot;, where everything he was so present to everything, there was this other world going on in his head that we didn&#39;t know about, because we didn&#39;t know that was happening. And I remember he was racing out the door, and we&#39;re like &quot;Oh, let&#39;s take a picture, [have] a hug&quot; and he was being very generous and courteous and everything. He&#39;s taking a picture- you can kind of see it in his eyes, he&#39;s like &quot;I gotta get out of here!&quot; [laughs] Actually, if you look online, if you see this picture of me with [Luca Tama?], you&#39;ll see me, and Michael, and he&#39;s wearing his red, [Luca?] has blubberdy hair, and I&#39;m wearing a stripey-shirt, or whatever, that&#39;s literally that moment... But yeah, we didn&#39;t know literally &#39;til he walked out the door, and then Vince turned to us and said, &quot;So, Michael had to leave because...&quot; [Laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">The MJCast</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did you feel that the &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; video, was it very different to what was happening with &quot;Black or White&quot;, just did it seem like a different kind of Michael, or a different time in his life?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Stea</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: For me it did. Personally, I guess I made up my own little story about [his reserved demeanor], &#39;cause he did seem different than the first time, the first time there was a lot of playing and laughing and we had video games in the truck outside, and the kids were around, like Macaulay [Culkin] and everybody was running around, and his nieces and nephews, and John Landis and his sons and our son and daughter, and pie fights. It was a little crazier, in terms of the set, and then it was definitely a much more adult set with &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;. It seemed more serious, the song was more serious. He seemed a little more serious. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was because of the lawsuit stuff, but I think in the end, it really just- While we were filming, I was thinking, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s really taken a toll on him.&quot; He&#39;s more reserved, he&#39;s more internal, something was shifted for him. But then, of course, I find out the second week that we wrapped that he&#39;s totally concerned in another world because his son is being born. [laughs] Moral of the story, don&#39;t make up stories in your head about what you think is actually going on. [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">The MJCast</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: [Mentions this leaked &quot;Black or White&quot; footage] How much sort of personal interaction did you get to have with Michael on the set of &quot;Black or White&quot;, or &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; or the MTV performance?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Stea</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Oh, all of it. All the time. I was the one who taught him his steps, so I got to just work with him, all the time... Vince would be off doing his thing and prepping for stuff, and it was my responsibility to teach him what he needed to do. So I had a lot of interaction with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Vincent Paterson, choreographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.gaycitynews.com/choreographer-supreme/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vincent Paterson: Master of All Media&rdquo; (January 13, 2006)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200415185958/https://www.gaycitynews.com/choreographer-supreme/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A never-seen alternate version of Jackson&rsquo;s Blood on the Dance Floor video which Paterson shot with an 8mm camera grainy, overexposed, and sexy as shit was shown, and Paterson said, &ldquo;Michael loved it, but Sony hated it and refused to release it, which is where all the trouble might have started.&rdquo;</span></p></p></body>
