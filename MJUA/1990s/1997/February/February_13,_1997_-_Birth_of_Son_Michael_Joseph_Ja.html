		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Birth of Son Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. (&ldquo;Prince&rdquo;) / &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot; Album Cover Photoshoot</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">Date confirmed in &ldquo;Iconic&rdquo; magazine (&ldquo;turned up on&hellip; the day his first son Prince Michael&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Will Wilson, painter of &ldquo;Blood on the Dance Floor&rdquo; album cover, &ldquo;Iconic&rdquo; magazine (2012), from Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo; (article summary/quotes)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s love of the &lsquo;Sleepwalking&rsquo; painting led to Wilson being approached to do the cover for BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR. Michael missed several arranged sessions, but ironically turned up on the day you wouldn&rsquo;t have expected him to, the day his first son Prince Michael was born on 13th February, 1997.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wilson did the painting from the photographs he shot, but it was several months later until he found out his work had been used, in quite bizarre circumstances. Wilson told Iconic Magazine in 2012.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was getting out of the tube at Champ Elysees and I saw on the side of the Virgin Music store my painting. I was shocked and I couldn&rsquo;t speak to anyone as I was by myself. I was just standing there. I was happy to see it that big. It was so exciting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The day Wilson sent the finished painting to Michael, via FedEx delivery; he had to literally chase after them to pull it back as Michael personally phoned him to ask him to paint a dark armband on his right arm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One privilege Wilson took with the painting was by placing his cousin&rsquo;s initials MH (Matthew Hammond) on the cover in a secret spot. Matthew was a huge collector and Wilson promised him that if he did the painting he&rsquo;d place his initials on it in a secret spot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Spent two weeks at no. 1 on the UK&rsquo;s albums chart, and peaked at no.12 on the R&amp;B albums charts and no.24 on the Pop albums chart in the States.</span></p></body>
