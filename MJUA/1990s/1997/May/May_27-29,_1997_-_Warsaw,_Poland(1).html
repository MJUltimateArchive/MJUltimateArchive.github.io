But I am deeply touched and honored to receive this. And, for me, Poland is such a lovely, lovely, lovely place&hellip; To me, you are people of courage, honor, bravery, resilience, and, most of all, class. And I just want to say, I&rsquo;d actually like to live here. [smiles] I&rsquo;d like to organize &quot;Children&rsquo;s Day&quot; here&hellip; It&#39;s a holiday time not only for children, but also their parents.&rdquo;, declares Jackson, while on a brief, yet elaborate tour in Poland regarding the construction of a unique family theme park there. Major of Warsaw, Marcin Święcicki, and Jackson sign a letter of interest in which both parties agree to prepare for the park&rsquo;s construction, and upon signing the &ldquo;preliminary letter of intent&rdquo;, he addresses a few words to the officials: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say thank you, Mr. Mayor and everyone around the table for &ndash; and my great friend, Jacques, who, pretty much, make a dream come true. And I have something to say: I&rsquo;ve been around the world six times since I was a baby, and no other country has touched me like Poland has.&rdquo; He will later send &nbsp;in a special phone message: &ldquo;To the people of Poland..hmm.. I wish</span><span class="cs5F6B85C7">﻿</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> progress, development, prosperity, to become one of the greatest nations of Europe. Happiness, love and peace for all the children of Poland. My heart is with you. Forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael made a special New Year&rsquo;s speech for the people of Poland later that year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;To people of Poland, I wish progress, development, prosperity, to become one of the greatest nations of Europe, happiness, love and peace for all the children of Poland.

Pretty much I&#39;ve found the house that I&#39;m going to have there so I know I&#39;m going to be living there, as well. I&#39;ll be going in and out a lot&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael returned [to Poland] in May, 1997 with an idea to build a theme park in Warsaw. A letter of Michael&rsquo;s intentions was supposedly written and signed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The idea was to build the park at the old Bemowo airport, where he had held his concert in September, 1996.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Despite several meeting with representatives of Michael&rsquo;s the idea never got off the ground, much to the disappointment of Polish people.</span></p></body>
