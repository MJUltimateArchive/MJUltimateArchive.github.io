It&rsquo;s been my passion and it has been his passion for it. So, the idea was to have Pavarotti and myself as the protagonists to announce it to the world and to pretty much organize like a cavalcade of stars to, to support us and sing this wonderful song where all the proceeds will go to children of the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Nicoletta Mantovani, wife of Luciano Pavarotti, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://operachic.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451c83e69e2011571075490970c-600wi"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vanity Fair Italiano&rdquo; (July 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (translated), &nbsp;(<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190522175648/https://operachic.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451c83e69e2011571075490970c-600wi"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We had to go to his home in New York, and it was the first time we saw him. I knew about him what was read in the newspapers... I had told Luciano, always very outgoing and cordial, that Michael Jackson probably would not have liked his vigorous handshakes, the pats on the back or the hugs that he never skimped on; I had told him not to take it if Jackson had kept us at a distance, if he had been surrounded by bodyguards: &quot;He&#39;s a bit of a special guy,&quot; I told him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael opened the door in a white t-shirt and jeans, all alone, and immediately ran up to greet Luciano. He sat on the couch right between us and started to speak with the enthusiasm of a little boy. After a few minutes, Luciano looked at me from under his glasses, and in dialect, said: &ldquo;But what story have you told me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">-In 1997, with Luciano Pavarotti, inviting Michael Jackson to a Three Tenors concert in Modena.</span></p></body>
