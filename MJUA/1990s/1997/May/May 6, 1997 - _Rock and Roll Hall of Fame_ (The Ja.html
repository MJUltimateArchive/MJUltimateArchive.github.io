I&rsquo;ll never forget it. It was a first in music history and now there&rsquo;s many more singles that went No. 1 for the Jackson Five.

We love you from the bottom of our hearts, sincerely, and I just want you to know that without you, my mother and my father, I don&rsquo;t think we would be here. And of course, God. And to all the fans, I don&rsquo;t want to take too much time, you were there unconditionally and I say thank you very much. Now we are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, oh! The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael stops and talks towards the camera.]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&rsquo;t like that angle, I like this one (looking forward). So whenever you call our name, I promise I love all of you we&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Berry Gordy, Motown founder, speech transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you Michael. Thank you Jackson Five. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon. Can you believe it? It&rsquo;s been almost 30 years ago when you guys came to audition for me in Detroit, not too far from here. From that first day your discipline, determination and incredible talent inspires me. A short time later you moved into my house in California and ate up everything. We worked hard and we played hard. The competition was fierce. The Gordys versus the Jacksons weekly baseball game, do you remember that? These guys were phenomenal. We played hard, the Gordys, but they beat us. Jackie you were the star, you and Tito were stars. Michael was a little shaky. Marlon beat me at chess. The Jackson Five were an all-encompassing group. The ages went from Michael 9, to Jackie who was 17. They had something for everybody. The girls went crazy. They played sold out arenas around the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We had to have such heavy security on the Jackson Five, not to keep the fans from hurting them, but to keep them from loving them to death. Everybody had a Jackson to fall in love with, including my daughter, who married one. If you don&rsquo;t remember where you&rsquo;ve been, you won&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, by enshrining those who created and performed rock and roll is perpetuating its history, so that all musicians and artists now and in the future can look back and see how they evolved. And how they created this great legacy. Thank you Rock and Roll Hall of Fame fathers. And to you Michael, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, thank you for giving me the opportunity to sing. Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Rolling Stone</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Disco fever swept the house, Crosby, Stills and Nash dazzled with their crystal-clear harmonies, and Michael Jackson emerged to give a rare speech. It was a night filled with surprises at the 12th annual Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, held at the Renaissance Hotel in Cleveland, where the Bee Gees, CSN and the Jackson 5 were inducted along with Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Parliament-Funkadelic, the (Young) Rascals, gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe and King Records founder Syd Nathan. The soiree took place in Cleveland for the first time since the Hall of Fame and Museum opened in late 1995.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Parliament-Funkadelic kicked off the night with a house-shaking medley of hits, including &quot;Tear the Roof off the Sucker (Give Up the Funk).&quot; Following their performance, the Artist, with wife Mayte in tow, inducted P-Funk (all 16 members made speeches) and cited their enormous influence on the Purple One&#39;s music. &quot;One time, George [Clinton] sent me a tape and said, &#39;You pee on it, send it back to me and I&#39;ll pee on it. Then we&#39;ll see what we&#39;ve got,&#39; &quot; the Artist said as his wife covered her face in embarrassment. (Later that night, he teamed with P-Funk for a jam at Cleveland&#39;s Odeon.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next up was Steven Van Zandt, who saluted blue-eyed-soul pioneers the Rascals. &quot;To be white and sound that black,&quot; he quipped, &quot;you had to be Italian.&quot; Van Zandt said that the first time he heard the band&#39;s &quot;I Ain&#39;t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore,&quot; he was making out with a girl: &quot;It was the sexiest record I ever heard. Sexier than the sex I was having.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shawn Colvin and Graham Nash inducted the absent Mitchell. After performing a stirring rendition of Mitchell&#39;s &quot;Free Man in Paris,&quot; Colvin noted, &quot;Joni used the word f--- long before it was fashionable.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Bee Gees, presented by Beach Boy Brian Wilson and Tony Toni Ton\&#39;e9 singer Raphael Saadiq, accepted their induction gleefully before giving one of the night&#39;s most popular performances: a sugar rush of disco faves like &quot;Stayin&#39; Alive&quot; and &quot;Jive Talkin&#39;.&quot; &quot;We are the enigma with the stigma,&quot; said Barry Gibb, referring to the group having been fricasseed by critics in the early days. With the Bee Gees&#39; induction, he said, &quot;we feel like we&#39;ve come home.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An especially moving moment followed when Mavis Staples delivered a soaring gospel medley in tribute to the late Mahalia Jackson. &quot;When she sang, you would just feel light as a feather,&quot; Staples said. &quot;God, I couldn&#39;t get enough of her.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Staples&#39; set was a nice lead-in for the night&#39;s most anticipated event: the Jackson 5. Michael Jackson bounded onstage ahead of his brothers to huge applause and said, &quot;I&#39;d like to say to our family, our children and, most of all, our mother and father: You were there to protect us with unselfish love, and because you were there, we are here.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The crowd was dead silent for a moment as Jackson stood on the stage with his arm around a young boy. Then he explained that the boy was his godchild and the son of the Bee Gees&#39; Barry Gibb. (Whew!) At one point, Jackson admonished a cameraman. &quot;I don&#39;t like that angle,&quot; he said, holding up his hand to the offending lens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Motown Records&#39; founder, Berry Gordy Jr., coaxed onstage by Jackson, said of the Jackson 5: &quot;They not only had hit records, they were a cultural revolution. For the first time, young black kids had their own heroes in their own image to idolize and emulate.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The star power continued as Tom Petty inducted Buffalo Springfield with poetic praise: &quot;They were bronze and brunette ... the city and the canyons ... electric and absolutely new acoustic ...They were immeasurably influential.&quot; Buffalo Springfield&#39;s Stephen Stills told the audience, &quot;We were young, and our hearts beat wildly, and we ran amok on Sunset Strip.&quot; Stills became the first artist ever to be inducted twice in the same night. &quot;I&#39;m doubly blessed and doubly honored,&quot; he said backstage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides Mitchell&#39;s no-show, the night&#39;s only other disappointment was the absence of Neil Young, who was in both CSNY and Buffalo Springfield with Stills. Earlier, Young had chastised the Hall of Fame for its $1,500 tickets and for allowing the event to be televised. Not that anyone cared. &quot;This isn&#39;t about Neil Young,&quot; said his Springfield band mate Richie Furay. &quot;It&#39;s about Buffalo Springfield.&quot; Added Stills: &quot;Well, he quit again.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs inducted bluegrass legend Bill Monroe. Skaggs, who broke down in tears several times during his speech, described Monroe as &quot;a musical father to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Elektra Records chief Seymour Stein honored the late Syd Nathan (who had ignited the careers of James Brown and Little Willie John, among others). James Taylor introduced Crosby, Stills and Nash. David Crosby was particularly moved by the honor, given the fact that he had a liver transplant in late 1994: &quot;I&#39;m honored to be here tonight. For a guy who was supposed to be dead a couple of years ago, I&#39;m doing quite well.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the clock struck midnight, the Rascals mobilized to jam on a scorching medley of songs, including &quot;Good Lovin&#39; &quot; and &quot;Groovin&#39;.&quot; Taylor followed with a stunning acoustic version of Mitchell&#39;s &quot;Woodstock,&quot; after which CSN gave another of the night&#39;s big highlights: dazzling versions of classics like &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; and &quot;Wooden Ships.&quot; Petty then joined the group onstage, and the bash came to a rousing finale with an all-star version of Buffalo Springfield&#39;s signature song, &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Judging by the gleeful looks on the faces spilling out of the ballroom just after 1 a.m., the night was worth every penny.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.cleveland.com/pdextra/2015/04/rock_comes_home_cleveland_host.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Associated Press&rdquo; (May 7, 1997)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200224211655/https://www.cleveland.com/pdextra/2015/04/rock_comes_home_cleveland_host.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony held in Cleveland started out last night short on music and long on rambling speeches, but ended up with an all-star jam into the early morning hours today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were barely 30 minutes of music during the first three hours of the event, which brought the biggest names in popular music to mingle with a crowd of local dignitaries in the Grand Ballroom of the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But just after midnight, the (Young) Rascals, who had been in legal feuds for years, put aside their differences and kicked off the jam with a strong medley that included &quot;Good Lovin,&quot; &quot;Groovin,&quot; and &quot;How Can I Be Sure.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Taylor followed with a solo acoustic version of inductee Joni Mitchell&#39;s anthemic &quot;Woodstock,&quot; a 1970 hit for Crosby, Stills and Nash. He was followed by CSN, which offered up &quot;Teach Your Children.&quot; The set ended at 1 a.m. with rocker Tom Petty and members of Buffalo Springfield joining CSN in &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The inductees were a diverse group, representing the broad definition of what has become known as rock &#39;n&#39; roll - the Bee Gees, the (Young) Rascals, Mitchell, Parliament-Funkadelic, Buffalo Springfield, the Jackson 5</span><span class="cs2DE14E7C"> </span><span class="csD5D7D290">and CSN.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the highlights was an onstage reunion of the Jackson 5, who were inducted by Motown labelmate Diana Ross. All five Jackson brothers - Tito, Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael - spoke, but didn&#39;t sing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The speech was a vamp on the Jackson 5&#39;s 1970 hit &quot;I&#39;ll Be There&quot; - a &quot;We&#39;re-Here-Because-You-Were-There&quot; homage to their mother and father and supporters such as Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. and Diana Ross.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson invited Gordy on stage. &quot;Their cultural impact was just incredible,&quot; Gordy told the crowd. &quot;They not only had hit records, they were a cultural revolution. For the first time, young black kids had their own heroes in their own image to idolize and emulate.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is the greatest honor ever,&quot; Jermaine told reporters later. &quot;The Grammys and all those other award shows; this is what we wanted.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All the brothers said it was great the ceremony was in Cleveland. &quot;Hollywood already has everything,&quot; Tito said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash provided some of the most touching acceptance speeches. Crosby, on the verge of death before a liver transplant in 1994, was visibly moved. &quot;I am honored to be here tonight. For a guy who was supposed to be dead a couple of years ago, I am doing quite well. Music is magic. Music bridges the gaps between human beings.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Bee Gees, ridiculed for years for their association with the 1970s disco era, provided one of the few musical highlights before the jam - bringing the crowd to its feet with a tight, rockin&#39; medley of their greatest hits - from early cuts such as &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and &quot;Words&quot; to disco hits such as &quot;Stayin&#39; Alive&quot; and &quot;Jive Talkin&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We&#39;re the enigma with the stigma,&quot; said Barry Gibb of his group&#39;s association with disco. &quot;But we feel like we&#39;ve come home tonight.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Raphael Saddiq of the R&amp;B group Tony! Toni! Tone! agreed, presenting Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibb as great songwriters and performers who remain &quot;hip, current and fresh.&quot; He was then joined by reclusive Beach Boy mastermind Brian Wilson for a touching, if slightly rough version of the Bee Gees&#39; &quot;Too Much Heaven.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s been four decades of making records, but this is what tells you that you&#39;ve been accepted. It&#39;s sort of like you&#39;ve found a home,&quot; Barry Gibb said afterward.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mavis Staples of the Staple Singers kept the music moving with a swinging, gospel medley in honor of Mahalia</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, who was inducted as an early influence on rock.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic were the first artists of the night to be inducted, opening the show with a laid-back seven-minute medley of their greatest hits, including &quot;Give Up the Funk&quot; and &quot;Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Clinton was dressed conservatively by P-Funk standards, decked out in black tails, white shoes and a wild headdress that barely controlled his tangle of multicolored, braided hair.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a brief video tribute, the Artist Formerly Known as Prince (accompanied by his wife Mayte) presented the award to Clinton, calling him &quot;the father of this funk mothership&quot; and a man responsible for &quot;creating the future of music.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The cast of P-Funk has changed over the years, but 16 members were inducted last night, including Clinton, Calvin &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Haskins, Ray Davis, Grady Thomas, Calvin Simon, Billy Nelson, Cleveland native Michael Hampton, Cordell &quot;Boogie&quot; Mosson, Garry Shider, Bernie Worrell, Glen Goins, Jerome Brailey, Walter Morrison and Collins.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Family members of the late Eddie Hazel and Tiki Fulwood accepted their awards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After being inducted, Clinton came into an adjacent pressroom eating ice cream and started chanting &quot;Mothership Connection.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Did the induction mean the mothership has landed? &quot;We parked for a minute,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We have to go to the bathroom and then we&#39;re gonna go around and do it till the next millenium.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Up next were the (Young) Rascals&#39; Felix Cavaliere, Dino Danelli, Gene Cornish and Eddie Brigati. They were inducted by fellow New Jersey homeboy Steve Van Zandt, who delivered his tribute by doing his best impression of an Italian-American standup comic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was only half-joking when he called the group the first rock band in the world. &quot;There were some guys making noise over in England in the 1960s,&quot; he said. &quot;But in the real world, in the center of the universe in New Jersey, the Rascals were the first band ... &#39;You Better Run,&#39; &#39;Good Lovin,&#39; &#39;Girl Like You,&#39; &#39;People Got To Be Free.&#39; To be white and get a sound that black you had to be Italian.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The reason we are here is because we love each other,&quot; Gene Cornish told reporters later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joni Mitchell and Neil Young were the most prominent no-shows. Mitchell cited personal pressures associated with her reunion with a daughter she had given up for adoption 30 years ago.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Young, who was inducted as a member of Buffalo Springfield, boycotted the performance because of a dispute with the rock hall over its refusal to provide him with enough free tickets to bring his family to the $1,500-a-plate dinner.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a letter to the rock hall, VH1, Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun and his Buffalo Springfield bandmates, Young also said he was upset with the rock hall&#39;s decision to sell broadcast rights to VH1, feeling that featuring the ceremony on TV commercialized and cheapened it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The VH1 Hall of Fame presentation has nothing to do with the spirit of rock &#39;n&#39; roll,&quot; wrote Young. &quot;It has everything to do with making money. Inductees are severely limited in the amount of guests they can bring. They are forced to be on a TV show, for which they are not paid.&quot; The show will be aired on VH1 Friday and Saturday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Young&#39;s Buffalo Springfield bandmates Richie Furay, Bruce Palmer, Dewey Martin and Stephen Stills accepted the award, which was presented by Tom Petty. Buffalo Springfield, Petty said, &quot;were bronze and brunette, they were fringe and paisley, ... they were ominous and a country morning ... they were immeasurably influential.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Richie Furay later told reporters &quot;For me, this isn&#39;t about Neil Young. It&#39;s about Buffalo Springfield and what&#39;s being bestowed upon us as a group.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stills was the first person to be inducted twice in the same night, for CS&amp;N and Buffalo Springfield. &quot;If I had to come in a rowboat and stand outside, I would have,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nash accepted the award for Mitchell, saying she couldn&#39;t be there because she wanted to spend time with her daughter. Singer-songwriter Shawn Colvin offered up a nice solo acoustic performance of &quot;Free Man in Paris,&quot; a song from Mitchell&#39;s 1974 &quot;Court and Spark&quot; album, then launched into a rambling induction speech that soon lost the interest of the crowd.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The late Bill Monroe, the bluegrass pioneer, was also inducted as an early influence by Emmylou Harris and Ricky Skaggs. &quot;He represents what rock and roll strives for - the power and the arrogance, the heart and soul, he put everything into it,&quot; Harris told reporters after the induction.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Skaggs gave one of the most compelling induction speeches of the evening, breaking into tears on several occasions.
