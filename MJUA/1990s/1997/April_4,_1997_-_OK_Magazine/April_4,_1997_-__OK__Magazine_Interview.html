I&#39;m in bliss 24 hours a day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Can you talk us through the birth of your son?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: It&#39;s hard to take step by step, but the snapshots in my mind from the birth show our excitement and nervousness. Debbie was so strong throughout the delivery. There were shouts of joy when the baby was born. I couldn&#39;t believe the miracle I had witnessed. It was unbelievable!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, describe the relationship between you and Debbie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Debbie and I love each other for all the reasons you will never see on stage or in pictures. I feel for the beautiful, unpretentious, giving person that she is, and she fell for me, just being me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Debbie, what are your current feelings for Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie: I love him even more now than before our son was born. Fatherhood has brought out a very protective streak in him. He is so loving and strong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: What is the boy&#39;s name? Why is he so named, and which of you does he look like the most?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: His name is Prince Michael Junior. My grandfather and Great-grandfather were both named Prince, so we have carried on that tradition, and now we have a third Prince in the family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie: He is so beautiful! I think he has my eyes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, among all your life&#39;s glittering achievements, how does fatherhood rate?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Words can&#39;t describe it. There is no miracle in life that compares with watching your son come into the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Has the baby smiled or responded in any way to the two of you yet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: He smiles all the time and his eyes twinkle when I sing to him. He definitely knows my voice. Debbie tickles his chin and he giggles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Debbie, does Michael change the baby&#39;s nappies, get up in the middle of the night to feed him, and do his share of the chores?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie: Yes, Michael does everything. He loves being involved in every aspect of caring for the baby. He is such a wonderful father, feeding him, holding him and, of course, singing to him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Debbie, you have married and had a baby with the most famous man on earth. What effect has that had on you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie: I have married and had a baby with the man I will always loved and I am on top of the world. The only time I feel sad is when I see quotes attributed to me that I never said or when I hear late night comedians taking cheap shots at my husband when they are not true. Don&#39;t believe 99% of the garbage you read or hear. I know that we will be under increasing public scrutiny and I don&#39;t look forward to that, but I know that will always be a part of being married to Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, you so rarely give interviews; what is the one thing you would like to say to your fans at this time?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Thank you to all my fans for understanding how important it is to me to protect my family from the public eye. I have lived in a &quot;fishbowl&quot; all my life and I want my son to live a normal life. You&#39;ve stood by me through my career and now you share my greatest joy. I love you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, what are your hopes for Prince Michael Junior&#39;s future?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I want him to grow up being surrounded by love and family, to receive the best education I can provide him with, to discover and develop his talents, and to use his resources to make life better for those less fortunate than he.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Are you preventing Debbie from seeing the child?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: No, that is completely false. We have been together as a family since the birth of our son and we&#39;ve cherished every moment as a family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, what has been your family&#39;s reaction to the birth of your son?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: They are all very excited. I&#39;m already getting tips and advice about schools and such.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: What sort of dad will you try to be?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: The best! My father was always there for us through the stardom of the Jackson 5 and through the ups and downs that followed. I, too, will always be there for my son. It&#39;s the most important thing in the world to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Debbie, what are you family&#39;s feelings about Michael?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie: They&#39;re crazy about him. They were delighted to discover how warm and genuine that he is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: And how would you describe Michael&#39;s strengths as a father?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie: He&#39;s very patient and protective. He never rushes what he&#39;s doing with the baby. I was very proud of how tough he was about our privacy. He&#39;s incredibly strong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, are you still close to your family? How often do you see your parents, brothers and sisters? Have they met your baby yet?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: We talk and see each other all the time. We recently had a big &quot;get-together&quot; where all the cousins met one another for the first time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: We believe the child&#39;s godmother may be Elizabeth Taylor. What is it that draws you to Elizabeth? Many would call it an unlikely friendship. What do you have in common?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Elizabeth knew many of things I went through growing up in the spotlight. I can say a few words, or just sigh sometimes and she knows what I&#39;m feeling. It was wonderful to find someone who understood me so well. I pray for her and I want her to share the joy of my son&#39;s birth for many years to come.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: What sort of gifts have you received for Prince Michael Junior?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: We&#39;ve received some fantastic gifts. Wonderful treasures, stuffed animals, toys and baby clothes from around the world. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all my wonderful fans for helping to welcome our baby into the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Michael, what are Debbie&#39;s strengths as a mother?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Debbie is a very strong and caring woman. She is a wonderful mother!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: Can we expect a song about your son on your new album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: The birth of my son has been very inspirational to me artistically, and there will definitely be a song in the future.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">OK: And one about Debbie, too?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Any song about my son has to be about Debbie as well.</span></p></body>
