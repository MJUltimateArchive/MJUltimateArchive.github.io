Now I ask you for a moment of love and silence&hellip; And tonight we all stand united and ask &lsquo;What More Can I Give?&rsquo; and when we leave here tonight let us take this love and give it to all the people everywhere in every corner of the Earth&hellip; To the families of the victims of September 11th that are here with us tonight, &lsquo;You Are Not Alone&rsquo;.

(Click for photos from the event.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No set screamed that lesson louder than P. Diddy&#39;s six-song maelstrom. The rapper and his posse ambushed the stage, outfitted in army fatigues and combat boots. &quot;We ain&#39;t goin&#39; nowhere/ We can&#39;t be stopped now,&quot; went the chorus of the opening song, &quot;Bad Boy for Life.&quot; Diddy, displaying his supremacy with service medals adorning his camouflage jacket and silver stars pinned to his crooked cap, riled the crowd to get on its feet and make some noise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This is dedicated to being an American, each and every one of you, and everyone we lost September 11,&quot; he said at the song&#39;s end, before launching into &quot;It&#39;s All About the Benjamins.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While moments of silence are customary in the wake of any tragedy, and &#39;NSYNC would later orchestrate one during their set, P. Diddy wanted just the opposite. He conducted the crowd through a stadium wave that circled RFK three times while he asked for 30 seconds of pure noise. &quot;I want the world to hear you,&quot; he shouted above the roar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">P. Diddy was as animated as anyone onstage that night, dancing and marching from one end to the other while goading the audience to grow ever louder. &quot;Check this out, terrorists!&quot; he hollered during an explosive version of &quot;Come With Me&quot; &mdash; the track he recorded with former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page for the &quot;Godzilla&quot; soundtrack &mdash; right before the threatening verse that begins with &quot;I want to fight you&quot; and ends with &quot;I&#39;m gonna take you with me.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With a huge gospel choir that spanned the length of the stage, his finale of &quot;I&#39;ll Be Missing You&quot; featured Faith Evans on backing vocals.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like Diddy&#39;s &quot;Bad Boy for Life&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll Be Missing You,&quot; several songs performed by other artists took on a deeper meaning after September 11. Aerosmith&#39;s &quot;Livin&#39; on the Edge,&quot; with the line &quot;There&#39;s something wrong with the world today,&quot; was eerily prophetic, while James Brown&#39;s &quot;Living in America,&quot; Huey Lewis &amp; the News&#39; &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and Al Green&#39;s classic &quot;Let&#39;s Stay Together&quot; were reassuring.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Backstreet Boys opened the show with the national anthem, and pounced on a five-song set that included their hits &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; and &quot;Shape of My Heart,&quot; as well as the new song &quot;Drowning&quot; from their upcoming greatest hits collection, </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Hits: Chapter One.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve never been more proud to be an American,&quot; Brian Littrell said at the close of the set. &quot;Remember [our] troops in your prayers and thoughts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Red, white and blue seemed to be the required colors of the day, as the crowd was speckled with the colors and nearly all the artists incorporated the scheme into some part of their stage attire. Aerosmith&#39;s Steven Tyler had portions of the American flag sewn into his torn and faded denim trench coat, while guitarist Joe Perry, clad in leather pants and a chest-baring black shirt covered by a D.C.&#39;s Metro Police Department jacket, played a stars-and-stripes-laden guitar for &quot;I Don&#39;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; and the band&#39;s signature tune &quot;Walk This Way.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We thought the world was coming to an end,&quot; Tyler said at the onset of Aerosmith&#39;s high-energy performance, &quot;but we got something you can&#39;t kill: love, liberty and the pursuit of rock and roll!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though P. Diddy took some time to get the crowd going, the frenzied response to &#39;NSYNC was immediate when the first notes of &quot;Pop&quot; swept through the stadium. The group&#39;s choreography was expectedly flawless as they cavorted through &quot;Tearin&#39; Up My Heart&quot; and set-closer &quot;Bye Bye Bye,&quot; which followed a bit of teasing from the guys about forgetting to &quot;say bye&quot; after finishing the ballad &quot;This I Promise You.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s really good to see Rod Stewart fans standing next to &#39;NSYNC fans standing next to P. Diddy fans,&quot; Justin Timberlake said of the common love of music that united the crowd in the huge venue. &quot;It&#39;s good for the country that everybody&#39;s ready to rebuild.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time &#39;NSYNC left the stage, the show, expected to last eight hours, was 90 minutes behind schedule, and the remaining performances were pruned so as not to lapse further behind. As such, sets by Destiny&#39;s Child, Goo Goo Dolls, Train, Mariah Carey and Michael Jackson seemed rushed compared to the casual flow of the first half of the evening.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Destiny&#39;s Child &mdash; looking patriotic in identical stars-and-stripes pants, with Beyonc&eacute; Knowles in a white top, Michelle Williams in a red one and Kelly Rowland in blue &mdash; opened with &quot;Survivor,&quot; another tune which took on renewed significance, and dedicated their cover of the Bee Gees-penned &quot;Emotion&quot; to the victims of the attacks. They ended their set with an a cappella rendition of a gospel hymn.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mariah Carey&#39;s black open-back dress with a plunging neckline brought to mind images of Jennifer Lopez&#39;s infamous Grammy outfit as she emerged to dedicate &quot;Hero&quot; to &quot;everybody in America.&quot; After the moving ballad, she raised the onstage energy with &quot;Last Night a DJ Saved My Life&quot; with the help of Vegas-styled showgirls waving giant white feathers. But even DJ Clue, who manned the turntables for the song, couldn&#39;t resuscitate the mostly lifeless crowd after more than 11 hours of concert.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Minutes after Carey left the stage, those who remained in the audience (many cleared out after &#39;NSYNC) began chants of &quot;Michael, Michael.&quot; Following an introduction by comedian Chris Tucker, a delicate piano instrumental of &quot;We Are the World&quot; wafted through the stadium while images of children from foreign countries, many shown posed with Jackson, were projected on the video screen. In an open, white long-sleeved shirt atop a matching V-neck T and black pants, Jackson lip-synced &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; while prancing around the stage, often posing above an air vent to optimize the windblown effect created by his long hair and loose, flowing shirt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To cap off the display, he boarded a cherry picker that carried him above the first few rows while he danced on the small platform and hung from its railings. After jumping down from the machine, he informed the crowd no less than seven times that he loved them, then spun in circles in a dance that ended with him on the floor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson left the stage right after, much to the shock of fans who had waited 11-and-a-half hours for what seemed to be only one song. The silence grew to modest cheers after an announcement was made to stay tuned for the finale, the first live performance of &quot;What More Can I Give,&quot; the concert&#39;s namesake number, which has been recorded as a benefit single (see<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1450128/"><span> </span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1450128/"><span class="cs8567212B">&quot;Mariah, Celine Join Lineup For Michael Jackson Charity Single&quot;</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finales of this type are usually marked by an all-star gathering of the artists who performed earlier; however, in light of the late hour, many of them had already left the building. So those who took the stage for the evening&#39;s last dance were a picked-over crop of the talent that hit the stage throughout the last several hours.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, now in a glittery silver bolo jacket with an American eagle emblazoned on his chest and left shoulder, was joined by JC Chasez and Chris Kirkpatrick of &#39;NSYNC; Mariah Carey; Usher, who earlier performed his hit single &quot;U Remind Me&quot;; teen country singer Billy Gilman, who had impressively sung the second half of &quot;One Voice&quot; a cappella after experiencing problems with his backing audio track; Angie Stone, whose set was cut entirely due to time constraints; Chris Tucker; Mya; Fabolous and former child actor Macaulay Culkin. Their collective rendition of the song was choppy and disparate, held together solely by Jackson, who, along with Gilman, seemed to be the only ones who knew the words.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Other performance highlights included O-Town (who sang &quot;All or Nothing&quot;), Carole King (&quot;So Far Away&quot;), Pink (Kris Kristofferson&#39;s &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;), Bette Midler (&quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,&quot; &quot;The Rose&quot;), Ce Ce Peniston (&quot;Finally&quot;), America (&quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot;), Goo Goo Dolls (&quot;Slide,&quot; &quot;Iris,&quot; Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;American Girl&quot;), Train (&quot;Drops of Jupiter&quot;) and Rod Stewart (&quot;Hot Legs,&quot; &quot;Forever Young&quot;).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Proceeds from the concert will benefit the American Red Cross Liberty Relief Fund, the Salvation Army Relief Fund, the Pentagon Relief Fund and the Rewards for Justice Fund, which supplies rewards to those who help identify and apprehend individuals who are planning, or have committed, terrorist attacks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.salon.com/2001/10/22/jackson_benefit/"><span class="cs8567212B">Salon (October 22, 2001)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I really wanted to like the concert. &ldquo;United We Stand&rdquo; it was called, an all-day benefit Sunday at RFK Stadium in Washington. I really wanted it to be a great time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We all did. After all, what&rsquo;s not to like about helping the victims of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon? And if it involves a day of performances by more than 20 of the biggest stars of pop music &mdash; so much the better, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Organized by Michael Jackson, and scheduled to be broadcast on ABC in November, the theme of the show was &ldquo;What More Can I Give&rdquo; &mdash; not coincidentally Jackson&rsquo;s new Sept. 11-related single, being debuted live that evening. Unlike New York, D.C. has had few opportunities to publicly grieve and give support to one another. This show seemed a good opportunity to give back to the community, and spend some time healing with 50,000 of my neighbors.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately, among the things being given back were the invites to perform by top billers Mick Jagger, Kiss and others. None of them showed up. With other announced participants Ricky Martin, Aaron Carter and MC Hammer MIA, the lineup for the show had become rather fluid. So much of the lineup had been replaced by showtime that it was an altogether different show than the one fans bought tickets for.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the organizer, Clear Channel Entertainment, part of the massive radio and concert promotion firm that dominates the music industry right now, was a professional outfit &mdash; the sort of operation that could handle anything, right? And hey &mdash; it was a </span><span class="cs43C038A">benefit</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> concert. It didn&rsquo;t matter </span><span class="cs43C038A">who</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> performed &mdash; everyone will like the concert for the cause, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No. To all of the above. This was the worst benefit concert ever. As President Bush might say: &ldquo;The cause is just.&rdquo; But the show was just terrible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is much reason for hope early on for the show. After all, it is billed as the first time the Backstreet Boys and &lsquo;N Sync ever shared a stage &mdash; unless you count the Super Bowl. It is the first time Michael Jackson has performed since &hellip; well, there was the MTV Video Music Awards, and a couple of shows before Sept. 11. It is the first time Mariah Carey has performed since her various breakdowns and her unrelated crappy movie was released. It is the first time I had ever seen any of the above in concert, but only because I don&rsquo;t get out much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Backstreet Boys open with a heavily harmonized &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner,&rdquo; which was also how the group kicked off the Super Bowl. In fact, over half the set is similar to what they played during the weekend&rsquo;s other big rock benefit, Paul McCartney&rsquo;s Concert for NYC. No problem, but you would have thought that with the advance warning, and previous night&rsquo;s practice, the technical problems would be worked out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They aren&rsquo;t. The audio is choppy, and continues to be so for the following act, Crystal, and &rsquo;80s rocker Huey Lewis. No one worries. It is early &mdash; they are just working out the bugs!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Note: This is foreshadowing. They never did work out the bugs. Apparently, Roosevelt Jr. High School&rsquo;s 8th Grade AV Club was unavailable to do sound and tech, and they had to get a less-experienced crew.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some early highlights:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Brown&rsquo;s mike is silent for the first half of &ldquo;Living in America.&rdquo; Maybe he just isn&rsquo;t singing, but I doubt it. No one sweats that much mutely lip-syncing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The pre-taped audio track for pre-teen C&amp;W sprite Billy Gilman gives out midway through his single &ldquo;Down Here on Earth.&rdquo; The kid soldiers on, and gives one of the best performances of the entire event.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is a pixel problem on the Jumbotron. It distorts the logo for the concert, making it &ldquo;Unit We Stand.&rdquo; Various immature people in my row find this quite amusing. OK, only me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It takes </span><span class="cs43C038A">one hour</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> to set up a mike for Carole King&rsquo;s acoustic rendering of her classic &ldquo;Far Away. The settings are too high; the mike is &ldquo;hot,&rdquo; making her even more shrill than usual.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">John Stamos and Kevin Spacey welcome us to the show, three hours after it has already begun. However, the too-high volume, mixed with poor acoustics, and RFK&rsquo;s delayed echo, make their potentially inspiring words totally and completely incomprehensible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">O Town, from the ABC show &ldquo;Making the Band,&rdquo; performs, and unfortunately, you can hear them perfectly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The performances get better as the day wears on, though the waits between sets make the development absolutely meaningless. They really should have called this thing &ldquo;United We Please Stand By, We&rsquo;re Experiencing Technical Difficulties.&rdquo; Each time a good band performs, the audience leaps up and cheers, inspired, energized. Then, after 15 minutes, the stage goes black, and it&rsquo;s back to sitting in the seats for a half-hour, stewing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Which is too bad, because there were strong performances from a diverse lineup: Aerosmith and Bette Midler, Al Green and P. Diddy. Less-strong performances from Ce Ce Penniston and America lead one to wonder, with the show three hours behind schedule, why they are there, and, more important, why we have to wait 30 minutes for their performances.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The most surprising set of the night is by hip-hop artist Pink, who is neither hip-hop nor pink. Sporting blond locks and no pink clothing at all, she performs not &ldquo;Lady Marmalade,&rdquo; her hit of the moment, but two acoustic &mdash; heck, let&rsquo;s call them folk &mdash; songs. One is &ldquo;My Vietnam,&rdquo; off her newest album, and the other was Janis Joplin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Me and Bobby McGee.&rdquo; It is the latter that was surprising, with Pink matching Joplin&rsquo;s throaty words with gritty enthusiasm &mdash; yet showcasing a wider range of notes than Joplin ever reached. It is great. Color me impressed. Ugh, did I actually just write that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the stands, however, people are getting antsy. As night begins to fall, concessionaires are running out of food and beverages. The waits became interminable, and surreal, as John Stamos pops up from time to time to welcome us, yet again, to the show. He proclaims that we would see several bands that have already performed, and promises a good time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I guess they want multiple takes for the TV special. We cheer well for the cameras.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Long after fan-base bedtimes, &lsquo;N Sync finally performs. The mass exodus upon its last number looks like a refugee crisis out of Khandahar. Stamos encourages the rest of us to stay. To be on the safe side, he records a &ldquo;Thanks, good night!&rdquo; for the cameras, while there is still enough crowd to cheer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to reflect on the common wardrobe theme of all the performers: The flag.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Destiny&rsquo;s Child: Flag pants. Each member has her own variation. All three were nice, but I&rsquo;d look silly in them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steven Tyler of Aerosmith: Leather flag jacket. Flashy, and looks warm. Could prove popular this winter, but I&rsquo;d look silly in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">J.C. of &lsquo;N Sync: Heart-shaped flag T-shirt. Makes him look like a patriotic Care Bear. He looked less silly than I would have, but still quite silly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Brown and P. Diddy: Flags as capes. Very dramatic, but just an etiquette note. You can&rsquo;t let them drag on the ground like that. Weren&rsquo;t you ever Boy Scouts? Now they have to be respectfully burned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pink and the bassist of the Goo Goo Dolls: Button-down flag shirt. Nice! But the downward-facing flag is backward on it. The field of blue is supposed to go over the left side, not the right, which is a sign of distress. I don&rsquo;t know why they both have this shirt, or why both were in distress. Maybe they are acknowledging the bored plight of the ever-waiting audience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The waits continued, the show seemingly lasting forever. Most of the performers have to enroll their kids in the D.C. school system. Rod Stewart is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. Whomever you came with you&rsquo;re now legally married to. DMV employees in the audience have gotten impatient and left.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The stadium is totally out of food. Tired and hungry, we scan the skies in hope of a U.S. Army humanitarian aid drop of MREs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the bleachers, people have swiped toilet paper rolls from the bathroom, and are flinging them into the crowd. Hunger has devolved us. Soon, we&rsquo;ll be rendered into Michael Jackson-craving monkeys, slinging our feces to and fro.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The earth slows. The molten core of the planet cools. Glaciers spread, then melt. Mountains crumble. Seas rise, then fall. Some future evolved species, maybe the dogs, will happen upon the ruins of the stadium. They will find us all frozen, yet still plaintively awaiting word from John Stamos saying we can go home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Why we stay: It&rsquo;s a benefit concert, for Chrissakes. Besides, after all this time, we&rsquo;re soldered to the seats with butt sweat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The crowd is nothing but unruly by the time the oft-napping roadies bring out a strange little box of mirrors and lights, such as Siegfried and Roy might make endangered tigers disappear within.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But no tigers come, just more roadies. For 45 minutes they continued to tinker with the box, until the crowd has had enough.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&rsquo;s time for a united audience to take a stand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boos start quietly, then grow to a fevered pitch. The roadies get a bit nervous, then flee. Suddenly, poor Mariah Carey appears from offstage, with little introduction, singing a torch song that sounds slightly unexpected.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We made Mariah appear with our boos! It&rsquo;s a lesson we all file away. And her song &ldquo;Never Too Far&rdquo; elicited some non-boos too. For some reason, she can&rsquo;t hit any of the high notes, but that&rsquo;s OK. All is forgiven. By song&rsquo;s end, she disappears in the box, with the cheers of exhausted fans behind her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The lights dim. This is the biggest production value of the evening. We are all quite excited.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And then: It opens up. Just that. It is just a big dumb mirrored box with the ability to open up. Carey sings something from her failed movie &ldquo;Glitter,&rdquo; complete with copious &ldquo;Glitter&rdquo; logos in the graphics on the screens. In the box, there is a prop glittered telephone, and a flashy glittered motorcycle. Neither is used for the song. They serve no purpose. She doesn&rsquo;t even look at them. There are more &ldquo;Glitter&rdquo; logos. The song &ldquo;The DJ Saved My Life&rdquo; makes no reference I could decipher to telephones and motorcycles, or the Pentagon &mdash; unless the DJs are lingo for 911 operators. The crowd is dumbfounded and silent. Aware she has lost us, Mariah asks the crowd to &ldquo;make some noise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We do. It is not, however, a good noise.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, it may be mean to boo a woman suffering from depression. At a benefit show. But then again, it&rsquo;s a benefit show, and we are there to support terror victims, not Mariah&rsquo;s new CD. The &ldquo;Glitter&rdquo; logos lighting the Jumbotron seem cheap and crass, like advertising at a wake.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And after all that time, she doesn&rsquo;t even use the motorcycle in the song? I&rsquo;d boo my own mom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re depressed, Mariah. But no one misses you after your bodyguards and dancers pull you offstage, seconds after the song ends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It is quite late, after midnight. There are maybe 1,500 people left at the show in a very large stadium, and every one of them needs a nap.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The organizers have to be cognizant how far this show has slipped from them, yet they do everything in their power to make things worse. They bring Chris Tucker out to introduce Michael Jackson, to booming cheers &mdash; and then, nothing. John Stamos comes out one last time, and introduces Michael Jackson, to booming cheers. And then nothing. Stamos then </span><span class="cs43C038A">reintroduces</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Michael Jackson, since he screws up the first time by referring to our city as Los Angeles, not Washington, D.C.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We learn the reason for the screw-up when he rudely informs us he is leaving, flying back to the coast. The Firestone Tire factory has less hissing. Stamos is an idiot. The Olson Twins would have had more support as emcees.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael Jackson takes the stage, and yes, he ultimately does, it is as showy as you could imagine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It starts with a film retrospective of Jackson&rsquo;s humanitarian work in Africa, to the instrumental strains of &ldquo;We Are the World.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The response he gets from the crowd is nothing short of mass cult-like love. As he appears onstage, breaking instantly into &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; there is more screaming and dancing than even &lsquo;N Sync enjoyed. No one cares about about the waiting, or, it would appear, about the Pentagon at this moment. They are here for Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And he is in top form, near as I can tell. His dancing was on. Meanwhile, the video played on, images of JFK, RFK, MLK, and Jesus, you see Mother Teresa, hear applause, and think it was for her. But no, it is just M.J. dancing on a steam grate. His stage presence was greater than all who came before him. When he climbs onto a cherry picker that takes him slightly above the front rows of the crowd, it is impressive. When he jumps off onto the stage, it gets me out of my pissy funk. It&rsquo;s a fun song. This is his concert, and for many in the crowd, it is worth the wait.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A quick observation. At some point, a woman runs up onto the stage and grabs Michael, hugging him, and screams &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; over and over to his face &mdash; you don&rsquo;t have to be a lip reader to see those words. It seems like minutes before security notices and pulls her off. Through it all, a showbiz trooper, M.J. keeps singing, and doesn&rsquo;t miss one note.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But there&rsquo;s the problem. At several points, the crazed fan&rsquo;s face is closer to the mike than M.J.&rsquo;s mouth. Yet we never hear her voice, we only hear Michael. Maybe she is just mouthing the words, respectfully, so as not to ruin the song! Maybe the ever-alert audio crew &mdash; folks I wouldn&rsquo;t trust to press play on a tape recorder &mdash; are able to mix her out of the sound on the fly!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Or maybe M.J. is lip-syncing. I doubt we&rsquo;ll ever know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Another observation: Like James Brown and P. Diddy, Jackson drapes himself throughout his song with an American flag, and uses it for effect throughout the song. However, at a particularly enthusiastic moment, he swings it around, and throws it to the ground, the flag hanging limply off the lip of the stage for the rest of the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Someone has to discourage the use of the U.S. flag as prop by musicians until they attend some kind of seminar in Not Desecrating the U.S. Flag for Dummies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Finale time, and a now costume-changed Gloved One (who wasn&rsquo;t wearing any gloves, but it&rsquo;s fun to call him that) begins to speak. Calling for a time of healing, he introduces his new song, &ldquo;What More Can I Give.&rdquo; There are many other songs this evening written for and dedicated to the tragedies &mdash; even more performed in New York on Saturday, and who knows how many more are down the pike? But with &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; on his r&eacute;sum&eacute;, Michael Jackson has the inside track on writing </span><span class="cs43C038A">the</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> song, and we all wonder what it would sound like.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As promised, he brings out many of the performers from the day. &lsquo;N Sync. The Goo Goo Dolls. Mariah Carey. The Backstreet Boys and Aerosmith had to head off to other concerts, but luckily there were several performers and actors to take their place, many of whom had nothing to do with the show. But not one note is sung before the real star of the show appeared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;m talking, of course, about Technical Problems. M.J.&rsquo;s mike &mdash; in fact, all the mikes it seemed &mdash; were hot, and squealed throughout the song. The other performers seem lost as they sing, if they sing at all. Michael runs like a cheerleader down the line, trying to get them in order. At one point, several techies run </span><span class="cs43C038A">in front of</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> the stars, trying to pull cords. How these people are employed during a time of recession I&rsquo;ll never understand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And as the song ends, the smoke machines come on, filling the stage with gray clouds. Then glitter cannons go off, and the sky over RFK was filled with fluttering, shiny, multicolored pieces of tinsel.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yes &mdash; for a finale of a Sept. 11 benefit show, the stage is covered in smoke and falling debris.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song is a disaster, and with its merciful end, the show does well. But Michael speaks: They&rsquo;re going to do it again!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But not for us in the audience. He thanks us and tells us to go home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs6F683FBB">&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The walk from the stadium is not a happy one. For 12 hours of attendance, there was maybe four or five hours of music. Many in the crowd grumble about being unwilling extras. They should: This was supposed to be a benefit concert, but it turned out to be as fake as the applause they&rsquo;ll add to the retaped &ldquo;finale.&rdquo; We were not informed on our tickets that the show was merely a chance for Mariah and Michael to plug new music, or for ABC-TV to plug John Stamos&rsquo; new TV show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If there&rsquo;s any justice, no one will watch Stamos. If there&rsquo;s further justice, no one will watch this benefit, or even ABC, ever again. I&rsquo;m really hoping for charred earth retaliation right now. That the victims of the Pentagon disaster will see some charity from this cluster fuck of a show is the only worthwhile aspect of the day, and probably the only thing keeping the masses from rioting. Just to be on the safe side, there appears to be more armed police as we leave then when we arrived.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The stadium behind me, my mind harks back to an early technical problem. It caused an attendee near me to misread the title of the show as &ldquo;What More Can I Stand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No more benefit concerts, that&rsquo;s for sure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Timothy Tilghman, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.rockontour.net/rfk21.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Rock</span></a></span><span class="cs8567212B"><a class="cs8567212B" href="http://www.rockontour.net/rfk21.html"><span class="cs149B5A36">on</span></a></span><span class="cs149B5A36"><a class="cs149B5A36" href="http://www.rockontour.net/rfk21.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Tour Issue # 2</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">United We Stand was a essentially a television production in desperate need of a full house of fans in the stands to convey an illusion, presenting the event for broadcast on television as a humanitarian charity effort. Alternative titles for the actual 11 hour long concert might have been &#39;United We Please Stand By&#39; or &#39;What More Can I Stand&#39; as stagehands lumbered about on stage to set up and break down after each performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Coincidentally, ABC got lucky that the weather was wonderful at RFK Stadium on Sunday, October 21, 2001. One could not have asked for a more pleasant day to hold an all day affair outside. The weather was comfortable, and the temperature fell slowly late into the evening without ever getting too chilly too early under a starless sky.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This event was actually a staged spectacular rather than a tribute concert. The audience were merely extras needed as spectators to record a star studded array of performers for a television special broadcast on November 1. I made the drastic mistake of ordering my concert ticket online. If I had only waited and showed up outside the venue, I could have scored a seat on the walk for one third the face value of the ticket! Scalpers and individual music fans were hawking fistfuls of open seats.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately, the concert was marred by amplification bouncing at the back of the stadium, drumbeats echoing over the live music on stage, repeated microphone problems, camera crews not always in focus, and sound levels out of sync for many performances. Stage preparation between acts was not conducted in a timely fashion. The stage may have been swarming with stagehands, but nobody coordinated their actions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Besides emcee John Stamos, the few notable celebrities to greet the stadium crowd were Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey, soccer player Mia Hamm, D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams, Miss Washington D.C. Shawn Evans, and U.S. shadow-Senator Paul Strouse. After James Brown&#39;s set, a stagehand came out with a long ladder to place white tape over the question mark after the concert&#39;s subtitle WHAT MORE CAN I GIVE (?). Since the ? itself appears on the ticket stub, several of us pondered the motivation behind this action during an early intermission.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was no big surprise roving packs of female teenyboppers were in the stands squealing and wailing over their favorite boy bands. Darling John Stamos, the ABC anointed host of the program, was serenaded with the chant &quot;Uncle Jessie&quot; from the young girls in the audience several times during his stage appearances.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Both the Backstreet Boys and &#39;NSYNC were on the bill together - literally hours apart. As an impartial observer, the B-Boys actually take time to sing and project their collective stage persona. &#39;NSYNC, on the other hand, is more preoccupied with calisthenics choreography for their synchronized dance moves. &#39;NSYNC seemed to generate a louder reception, but that may have been because more of them had waited longer for this group to appear on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Backstreet Boys had the prime position of launching the United We Stand concert with the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; sung a cappella. Their early set contained the selections &quot;I Want It That Way&quot;, &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot;, and a new song &quot;Drowning&quot;. With a starting time of 1:00 pm, many ticket holders were still streaming into the stands during their set.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was dark by the time &#39;NSYNC took the stage. Parents chaperoning gaggles of young girls were getting antsy as the concert wore on with many adults asking their charges whether they wanted to stay until &#39;NSYNC had performed or leave early. The N-Boys began their set with &quot;Pop&quot;. They also sang &quot;Tearin&#39; Up My Heart&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, and &quot;This I Promise You&quot;. During their set, &#39;NSYNC asked the audience for a moment of silence to remember those lost at the Pentagon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The lead singer for Train, Pat Monahan, solicited screams of desire from the teenybopper crowd as well. Their brief mini-song set consisted of &quot;Meet Virginia&quot; and &quot;Droplets of Jupiter&quot;. The band&#39;s posturing on stage wavered unevenly from that of rock&#39;n&#39;rollers to wanna-be babe magnets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Even when P. Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy Combs, Sean Combs, or the Puff Meister appeared on stage outfitted in battle fatigues, his arrival rivaled the applause reception bestowed upon Aerosmith. Ole Puffy rapped around the stage like a possessed evangelist. His animated set included &quot;Bad Boy for Life&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s All About the Benjamins&quot;, &quot;Come With Me&quot;, and &quot;I&#39;ll Be Missing You&quot; complimented by a choir for the survivors of 9-11.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Instead of observing a moment of silence, Mr. P.D. challenged the RFK crowd to make as much noise as possible during a repetitive triple wave throughout the stadium stands. Several of his rap segments contained samples of songs from Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, Diana Ross, and The Police, leading one to retort his musical originality is only exceeded by his prolific talent.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The mic stand was draped in red, white, and blue scarfs. The lead guitarist jammed on a Stars &amp; Stripes guitar. The lead singer was wearing an Old Glory floor length jacket. The hottest live set of the 11 hour long event belonged to Aerosmith. &quot;We&#39;ve got something you can&#39;t kill&quot;, Tyler announced, &quot;Freedom, love, God, liberty and the pursuit of rock &#39;n&#39; roll!&quot; He even recited lines from &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The boys from Boston banged out four bombastic hits, &quot;Living On The Edge&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t Want To Miss A Thing&quot;, &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, and their 1975 classic &quot;Walk This Way&quot; during a brief 20 minute set. Aerosmith was the only serious rock band on the bill at UWS. The stadium audience was clearly animated, up on its feet chanting the band&#39;s name in unison. I only saw the A-Boys live once before in December 1989, and they rocked their way at RFK.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Young and old alike were singing along to &quot;Don&#39;t Want to Miss A Thing&quot;. During &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, Tyler was belting out the lyrics through a megaphone for effect, revealing his painted finger nails. For his guitar solo on &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, Perry held his guitar up behind his head and played the lead effortlessly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Aerosmith&#39;s third leg of their 2001 Just Push Play Tour is currently underway, but the band was compelled to participate in this worthy endeavor. Lead guitarist Joe Perry mentioned his personal visit viewing the Pentagon and wore a black D.C. police jacket in a display of solidarity. Aerosmith had another engagement to perform later that evening and demonstrated their commitment by chartering their own flight, Aero Force One, to reach their headlining concert in Indianapolis.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rod Stewart was the only British artist on stage at UWS. Stewart appeared on stage with a large band, sporting women dressed in red miniskirts. Stewart launched into the Faces classic &quot;Hot Legs&quot; with projections of WWII pinups and performed his recent solo hit &quot;Forever Young&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rod the Mod characteristically kicked out soccer balls into the field audience. Stewart delivered a heartfelt set, dedicating &quot;Rhythm Of My Heart&quot; to the Allies, engaged in maneuvers in Afghanistan. The tall blonde on saxophone was one of the many talented musicians in his band who attracted a lot of attention.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several major American icons were on the bill. It was a rare treat to have James Brown, Al Green, Carole King, and Bette Midler all perform during the same afternoon. Although the show had begun to be running behind and stage set up between gigs was entirely too long, all of these artist were able to deliver micro-sets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Brown began his set with &quot;Living In America&quot;. His band was a massive ensemble, featuring synchronized gyrating women. &quot;Killing Is Out, School Is In&quot;, &quot;I Feel Good&quot;, and &quot;Sex Machine&quot; were all subsidized by Brown&#39;s fancy footwork on stage. Al Green came out bouncing on stage ready to perform an upbeat set that included his signature song &quot;Let&#39;s Stay Together&quot; and &quot;Take Me To The River&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Carole King was backed by Rod Stewart&#39;s stage band. She sang her staple &quot;So Far Away&quot; and debuted a song from her new album, &quot;Monday Without You&quot;. Bette Midler sang a well received &quot;From A Distance&quot; and the surprise &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;. Her final selection of &quot;The Rose&quot; was another major crowd-pleaser.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Huey Lewis and The News was the inaugural rock band on stage, opening with &quot;Heart of Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll&quot; to jump start the stadium. &quot;Power Of Love&quot; sent a positive message for the future. The micro-set by America was a stunning unplugged performance, featuring three acoustic guitars and bass guitar arrangement. The audience responded enthusiastically to their classic &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Young Country singing sensation Billy Gilman has a tremendous future if his career is judged by his ability to recover singing &quot;One Voice&quot; a cappella after his backing tapes began to falter. The girls let loose when Billy smiled on stage. The outstanding female vocal performance must go to Pink for her unplugged performances of &quot;My Vietnam&quot; off her new album and her incredible rendition of &quot;Me And Bobby McGee&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Goo Goo Dolls were one of two acts on both bills in NYC and D.C. that did double duty over the weekend. The Dolls opened their UWS set with &quot;Slide&quot;, but performed &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;American Girl&quot; only at both charity concerts. Destiny&#39;s Child also appeared at both the Garden and RFK Stadium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Host John Stamos did not walk out on stage until after Billy Gilman&#39;s impressive a cappella version of &quot;One Voice&quot;. Stamos was joined by Kevin Spacey, one of the few guest stars to put in an appearance at the benefit and make a pitch for the fund to help support the victims of the Pentagon tragedy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once again as during the Concert for New York City, Janet Jackson was projected live on the jumbotron via satellite feed performing &quot;All For You&quot; from on stage in Charlotte, NC. Ms. Jackson was looking mighty fine. Her workout on stage night after night has ribbed her stomach to perfection.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">An announcement that the Washington Redskins had won their first football game this season, 17-14 against the Carolina Panthers in overtime, brought the crowd a momentary respite from sitting on their rears during time lags in between set preparations which was business as usual for the 11 hour concert.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stamos appeared on stage for the second time following the Goo Goo Dolls set to record his closing comments. He had to do this twice after stating another city name as host to United We Stand. His segments for the ABC program were filmed out of sequence, soliciting both cheers and jeers from the crowd. Taping his introduction for the Michael Jackson finale was rather comical.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Having attended both charity concerts, there are striking differences between the two of them. Many more women were in attendance at RFK Stadium as opposed to the municipal personnel who were invited as honored guests at the Garden. Some 5,000 prime tickets on the Garden floor were distributed to the heroes and families in NYC.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were no loved ones holding up photos of the missing or victims from the Pentagon attack. There were no rescue workers welcomed on stage to introduce the performers. There were no moving stories about acts of heroism and sacrifice. There was no real thrust on the part of ABC to personalize the tragedy of 9-11.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several one hit wonders sang live vocals to the accompaniment of recorded backing tracks. These dubious performances included: Krystal - &quot;Supergirl!&quot;, Christina Milian - &quot;AM to PM&quot;, Ce Ce Peniston - &quot;Finally&quot; (she projected herself well), O-Town - &quot;All Or Nothing&quot;, and Usher - &quot;U remind Me&quot;. The gloved wonder could have phoned in his performance as several media sources have reported he lip-synched his vocal on the lone number he performed prior to the big finish.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mariah Carey put on a good facade for her stage appearance. Curiously, she was out of her element while on stage. She lost sight of the cause remembering those who suffered on 9-11. Her 11 minute prance about on stage was dwarfed by the stage production time stagehands needed to prepare for her overblown entrance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Many of the girls and women seated around me began barking openly, complaining about her slinky black dress. Was this outright jealousy over her ability to flaunt herself in that skimpy dress? So many catty remarks, one would think they were expressing personal anger over the pretty Prom Queen&#39;s coronation on stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Her overproduced set didn&#39;t really connect with the audience. Although &quot;Never Too Far&quot;/&quot;Hero&quot; was dedicated to the spirit of the evening, the lifeless audience could not muster the enthusiasm necessary after her tardy stage performance. Seats began to empty all across the stadium in the stands and on the floor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Carey&#39;s big number, &quot;Last Night a DJ Saved My Life&quot;, was simply ridiculous. Her shameless self promotion of the film Glitter during her performance was totally out of touch. The choreography for this had her emerging from the center of a large monolith with male dancers, a motorcycle prop, and a troupe of dancing girls in white glitter dresses with oversized white feathers surrounding her on stage. Her stage posturing bordered on neuroses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">By the time the grand finale was ready for taping, many of the event&#39;s major performers had already left the building because the television production had been running so far behind. By the stroke of midnight, many seats on the field and in the stands were hemorrhaging heavily. Announcements were made that D.C. Metro would be running an extended timetable, and patrons were reminded to remain patient for the main event.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Aaron Carter, Bon Jovi, M.C. Hammer, Kiss, Ricky Martin, Carlos Santana, and Matchbox Twenty were all reported in the media as participants, but these acts failed to perform on the bill. Even Britney Spears and Bruce Springsteen were rumored to be performing, but did not post.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It became painfully evident that this event was more of a staged happening being choreographed for television packaging then a tribute benefit for the lost loved ones of the Pentagon. It is sad that a major television network and a mega-sensation would unconsciously conspire to place their corporate and commercial concerns above the contribution made by members of the audience who donated both their money and personal time to participate in the stadium at this fundraising function.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shortly before midnight, comic Chris Tucker delivered some form of an introduction for Jackson, but it was only a dead end. Stamos had to tape his final segue before the big shoe could commence. Prepping his stage entrance, a video with &quot;We Are The World&quot; as instrumental music projected images of Jackson as an international humanitarian shown comforting children of multiracial complexions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Running out on stage after midnight, the audience managed to erupt in euphoria at the eighth wonder of the world live on stage. Michael Jackson sang a song from 1988, &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;. During the performance, images of JFK, RFK, JFK Jr., MLK, Mother Teresa, and Jesus were splashed upon the monitors as MJJ posed before a stage fan for a windblown effect.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Some of his tricks [included] being lifted over the crowd in a cherry picker and firing confetti glitter into the audience from strategically placed pipes. However, using dry ice to produce clouds of stage smoke and spewing debris into the stadium was an odd way to end a concert in remembrance of attacks that reigned this same kind of junk in their aftermath.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Embarrassingly, the grand finale was flawed by lack of preparation on the part of the performers. None of the singers appeared to know the words to &quot;What More Can I Give&quot;, and there was the recurring problem of hit or miss microphones malfunctioning. Technical problems did seem to plague many performers throughout the 11 hour charity marathon. In an incredible move on the part of MJJ as patrons were leaving in droves, he stated his desire on stage for a reshoot of the finale. After yammering into the mic for two minutes about his displeasure over the botched version, he was interrupted and informed that this was not an option.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://ultimateclassicrock.com/aerosmith-united-we-stand/"><span class="cs8567212B">The Ultimate Classic Rock (October 21, 2016)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...the network had to mostly cut around Jackson&rsquo;s participation.
