Geller, a former Israeli paratrooper famous for using mysterious mental powers to bend spoons, told the news service that the record company had deleted the words &ldquo;God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; &ldquo;USA&rdquo; and &ldquo;Angel 2000&rdquo; and had replaced a Star of David with a pentagram. &ldquo;Invincible,&rdquo; released this past Tuesday (and earning respectful but not enthusiastic reviews), is Jackson&rsquo;s first album containing all-new material since his 1991 &ldquo;Dangerous.&rdquo; &ldquo;The sensitivity of not wanting any religious symbols in my drawing I found quite extraordinary, because God is universal,&rdquo; said Geller. &ldquo;I went along with it because I understood that one of the removed items is a very Jewish symbol, and Michael is an international pop star, but I never did understand why the creator&rsquo;s name was eliminated.&rdquo; Sony Music could not be immediately reached for comment. Geller, who drew the detailed black-and-white illustration on a napkin in Jackson&rsquo;s New York hotel room last year, says that Sony technicians in Los Angeles had spent two days using a computer to scan the picture for hidden words in case he had written anything obscene. However, the Hebrew letter Shin, used to symbolize God, was left in the picture. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t know what that was,&rdquo; he said.</span></p></body>
