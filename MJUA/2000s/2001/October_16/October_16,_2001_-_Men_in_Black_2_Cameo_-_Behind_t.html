His scene was shot earlier this week on October 16. The movie is a sequel to the 1997 hugely successful film &quot;Men In Black&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of &quot;Men In Black 2,&quot; said: &quot;We shot a small scene with Michael on Tuesday. He was charming, funny, and really cool to work with.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The movie is planned for a July 3, 2002 release.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Barry Sonnenfeld, director, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.upi.com/Interview-of-the-week-Barry-Sonnenfeld/39881025222661/"><span class="cs8567212B">UPI (June 27, 2002)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Director Barry Sonnenfeld knew he was in for a wild ride when he signed on to make &quot;Men in Black II.&quot; But computer-generated aliens, a wise-cracking pug dog, speeding police cars and even the hilarious hijinks of co-stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were nothing compared to the wacky experience Sonnenfeld had directing pop icon Michael Jackson, who appears briefly in the film as—what else—a spaceman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Will thought it would be really cool,&quot; Sonnenfeld remarked before launching into a very funny description of his dealings with the enigmatic Jackson. &quot;We had many discussions, Michael and I, on the phone about what his role would be.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The director of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; and &quot;Big Trouble&quot; said that among the demands Jackson made before he agreed to take the part was that he appear in &quot;many scenes.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I kept saying, &#39;The script&#39;s already written,&#39;&quot; Sonnenfeld lamented. &quot;Then he said, &#39;Could I wear the [&quot;Men in Black&quot;] suit?&#39; and I said, &#39;Yes.&#39; So, once I said he could wear the suit, then he was really excited about being in the movie and then the next issue was he said, &#39;And I really want to be on the poster.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sonnenfeld said he failed to convince Jackson that only Smith and Jones, the stars of the original blockbuster, were allowed by contract to appear in print advertisements for the movie. The director said he tried to impress upon Jackson that his image on a poster would cause a ripple effect and then everyone in the cast would want to be on it as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He said, &#39;That&#39;s okay!&#39;&quot; Sonnenfeld recalled. &quot;And he said, &#39;Since the day I way born the only dream I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life was being on the poster for &quot;Men in Black&quot;...And I said, &#39;Since the day you were born?&#39; and he said, &#39;Yes.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The incredulous director went on to recount how Jackson refused to let the point go until studio executives at Sony Pictures set him straight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Although I suspect he may be on a poster in like South Korea. I think there was some arrangement,&quot; he joked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All that for a cameo? According to Sonnenfeld, that was just the beginning. The fun really started when he arrived on set and wanted to explore his character and scene in depth.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Since Jackson&#39;s scene took place in Antarctica, he had to act against a blue screen where computer-generated scenery and animals were added later. Sonnenfeld said Jackson wanted to discuss everything about the brief scene from the size of the icebergs to the type of penguin that was standing behind him. The &quot;meeting&quot; didn&#39;t end until Sonnenfeld finally said: &quot;There&#39;s a sky. It&#39;s blue with clouds. I gotta go.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It might have meant more work for Sonnenfeld, but Smith insists that the payoff is worth it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/16/1026802691721.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Sydney Morning Herald (July 17, 2002)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I very much wanted Michael Jackson to be in the first Men In Black. There was a scene in it when we showed all these aliens and George Lucas, Sylvester Stallone, Danny De Vito and Steven Spielberg were all there and I really wanted Michael to be in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But for some reason he didn&#39;t want to be considered as an alien in Men In Black I. But 15 months into shooting Men In Black II I got a message saying Michael Jackson really wanted to be in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I had a lovely conversation with Michael in which he told me he had seen the first Men In Black in Paris and had stayed when all the other people left the theatre and sat there and wept. I had to explain to him that it was a comedy.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sonnenfeld added: &quot;He said he would love to be in Men In Black II wearing the black suit, all that mattered to him was that he wore that black suit.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mary Vogt, costume designer, &ldquo;FrockTalk&rdquo; (June 30, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133904/http://frocktalk.com/?p=961"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Kristin Burke (Frocktalk)</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did you guys know, when you started the movie, that he was going to be in the movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Mary Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;No, Not at all. &nbsp;I think it was his idea actually; I don&rsquo;t know for sure. &nbsp;You&rsquo;d have to ask Barry Sonnenfeld, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that he had asked to be in it because he was a fan of the first movie, and this was the sequel. &nbsp;It was Sony Pictures, and he had his music deal at Sony, so he has a lot of Sony contacts and when they contacted Barry, he was like &ldquo;Oh yeah! &nbsp;That would be great!&rdquo; &nbsp;They were all excited that he wanted to be involved in this movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When they told you he was going to be in it, what was your reaction?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290">	I just thought it was great; I was sorry that it was just a cameo! &nbsp;I was hoping that he would have, like, a part! &nbsp;But it was just strictly a one-day cameo. &nbsp;But I was so excited about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When you got the word, did you call him for his sizes? &nbsp;How did you get his sizes so you could create the garment?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Well, you know, I am sure you&rsquo;ve dealt with actors who are super, super busy and I knew there was no way I was ever going to get a fitting with him. &nbsp;&nbsp;So, we contacted his agent, and of course they give you these sizes that are not really sizes, they&rsquo;re more like clues instead of sizes&hellip; When you know what people&rsquo;s measurements should be, and you get this stuff like, a human being could never possibly have these measurements&hellip; &nbsp;&nbsp;So I knew that those were completely wrong. &nbsp;I knew that he had a designer that he&rsquo;d been working with for like thirty years (Michael Bush), and I thought, &ldquo;Well, if anyone&rsquo;s gonna know, he&rsquo;s gonna know&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;At the time I think he was out of the country; I had trouble getting in touch with him. &nbsp;I knew that Rick Baker had body casts of him; it turned out to be a little bit of a hunt to find his sizes. &nbsp;Another designer had just done something with him where he made suits, and I found out where those suits were made. &nbsp;And, yeah. &nbsp;So it was a little bit of detective work! Michael&rsquo;s designer contacted me, a couple weeks later, and then we pieced together sizes. &nbsp;I was able to hire a body double that we did the fittings on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;So tell me about when you met him &ndash; was it the day he was supposed to work? &nbsp;And then you had to fit him that day?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Yeah, exactly, it was like the day he was going to work, and I had the suit and the shirt and the shoes and the whole thing. &nbsp;And it was on the Sony lot, and he had a trailer, just like a normal Starwaggon, nothing special. &nbsp;He had one security guard, and he knew I was coming &ndash; it was just me, because we didn&rsquo;t want to crowd his trailer with a whole lot of people &ndash; so it was just me, and his outfit, and the security guard let me in. &nbsp;And like, he was there, in like sweatpants and a robe, and you know how they have these like little small kitchens in those motor homes? &nbsp;He was at the table, making sandwiches! &nbsp;And there were these two kids, like little kids, his kids, and they were coloring. &nbsp;It was like the most perfectly normal family scene you could ever imagine. I never thought that his kids would be there, for one thing, because he was working. And I never expected for him to be making them sandwiches! &nbsp;I was expecting something, I guess, a little more elaborate! &nbsp;Or a little more bizarre&hellip;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (laughs)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;And he was just like, &ldquo;Oh Hi! &ndash; Oh, you have my suit?&rdquo; &nbsp;And he was like, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll put it on!&rdquo;, and so he went to the back of the trailer and put it on. &nbsp;I had pre-tied the tie, you know, velcroed it in the back so that he, well he&rsquo;s probably used to stage clothes that are already pre-rigged, and so&hellip; everything was fine. &nbsp;He said that he wanted to keep the clothes, and I just said, &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure everyone expected that. &nbsp;And then he went out and shot the scene, and it was just him shooting against a green screen. &nbsp;I think it took a couple of hours. &nbsp;And then, that was the end of it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was really interesting because he was really quiet, more concerned with the kids&rsquo; lunch than anything else. &nbsp;A phone call came in about music, a business call, and he suddenly, completely changed. &nbsp;He was then a very efficient person, you know, efficient voice and it was just all business, like a Wall Street stock trader or something. &nbsp;You could really see how he was, a businessman. &nbsp;It was very interesting.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Yeah. &nbsp;I mean, when you think about the superstars you&rsquo;ve worked with in your lifetime, he&rsquo;s gotta be up there in the top!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Oh, definitely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;We&rsquo;re very privileged.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Yes, I had worked with Sting, this was way in the beginning, like a million years ago, I was an assistant to Bob Ringwood on Dune. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even know who Sting was, and I was filling out his stuff, and I said, &ldquo;Sting, what&rsquo;s your last name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;(laughs)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;I needed it for the customs! &nbsp;He goes, &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; &nbsp;And then he gave me like his real name, Gordon Sumner. &nbsp;But I have found that working with sort-of the big stars, it&rsquo;s always a maze to get to them, you have to go through all of these people, and then when you finally get to them, they&rsquo;re usually, like, very nice. &nbsp;But accommodating them is tough, because you really feel like time is ticking, is at a premium. &nbsp;You have to be very efficient.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;This has been great Mary. &nbsp;But unfortunately here at my house, somebody has decided to turn on their leaf-blower so I am having some trouble recording this conversation!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vogt:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (muffled laughing) &nbsp;That&rsquo;s basically the story, anyway! &nbsp;The clothes (suits) were very simple, they were like tailored, and we made a million of them. &nbsp;But the fact that he was so nice, and so, you know, unaffected, which is interesting&hellip; he was just a very nice person! &nbsp;You know, making sandwiches for his kids.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Burke:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &nbsp;Well it&rsquo;s a great story. &nbsp;Thank you so much for sharing this, Mary!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you, Mary, for your time and for sharing your story about costume icon Michael Jackson. &nbsp;I look forward to talking with you in the future about more of your fabulous work!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Will Smith, actor, &ldquo;A Current Affair&rdquo; (May 2002) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjackson.net/forum/michael-jackson/michael-jackson-fan-aktionen-events/15739-michael-und-karate?p=682442#post682442"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Listen, Michael Jackson is really funny.

He plays Michael Jackson who is an undercover man in black. And he&#39;s an alien, so he only has partial MIB status. You know, he&#39;s in on the alien affirmative action program.
