Are there any artists that influence you?</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Lots of artists. Mostly entertainers. I would say Sammy Davis Jr., James Brown, Jackie Wilson. There&#39;s so many great singers from Aretha Franklin to Streisand, and I love Beatles music.

It was crazy. I remember staying up late to write my questions like I always did, and I wrote a bunch of questions for Michael Jackson. I had to turn them in to the record company, and then the day of the interview, they basically regurgitated one question and gave it back to me and said, &quot;Here &mdash; just ask him this.&quot; It was very well crafted, well worded. Something to the effect of: How does it feel to have a No. 1 album again in 13 countries? That just spoke to the team that was around him. I walked over across the street maybe an hour before we went live. It reminded me of a presidential process in the sense of the handlers and the route I was to walk: across Times Square and through Virgin Megastore, through the back door. I finally got in. I remember coming down the huge escalator at Virgin Megastore, and it was empty. And Michael was sitting in an aisle, flipping through records. The last handler sort of took me maybe 50 feet away, and I started walking down this aisle toward one of the greatest men ever. The first thing that struck me was how tall he was. Everybody I had met in Hollywood up until that point was disappointingly short and sort of underwhelming. I remember he made a bunch of very humble social gestures that just made me take a great liking to him. He took his glasses off &mdash; he was wearing gloves &mdash; he took his glove off, and I shook his hand. And he was gracious and, of course, famously soft-spoken. He said, &quot;Very nice to meet you, Carson,&quot; and then we just sort of sat there for a minute and flipped through vinyl. We talked about music and how much he loved vinyl. It was just a very bizarre, amazing 20 minutes with Michael Jackson in the aisle of a record store talking about music.</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20011107/aponline163704_000.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Washington Post&rdquo; (November 7, 2001)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20011107/aponline163704_000.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was at the Virgin Megastore at Times Square on Wednesday to... sign copies of his disc for fans.</span></p><p class="cs50A1639E"><span class="csD5D7D290">At one point, he made a grand appearance in front of the store, stepping onto a podium outside to acknowledge the huge crowd.
