King of Pop to begin humanizing himself...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Jackson, who hobbled onstage with the aid of a cane to give his acceptance speech, said he broke his foot recently while dancing, and so he couldn&rsquo;t perform. He then retreated to the wings after a few words of thanks--despite cries from the audience for him to sing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Given his injury, he clearly couldn&rsquo;t have done a high-octane, dance-minded number such as &ldquo;Billie Jean.&rdquo; But he could have sat on a stool for an intimate rendition of &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; one of the most introspective songs in his repertoire, or maybe a new ballad...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That was a major missed opportunity on a night when Jackson was not only one of the few artists ever to be inducted for a second time (he was already enshrined as a member of the Jackson 5), but, at 42, also the youngest solo artist ever inducted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The interest level was so high in the press room that a security official warned photographers at the start of the evening to behave when Jackson and boy band &lsquo;N Sync (who later inducted Jackson) came to the room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We are not going to compromise anyone&rsquo;s safety for the sake of a photo of Michael Jackson or &lsquo;N Sync,&rdquo; the official said sternly. &ldquo;We have to keep some sort of order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lisa Robinson, interviewer/journalist/writer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is wearing a white suit and is surrounded by huge bodyguards as well as his friend Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, who, at that time, was&mdash;for lack of a better word&mdash;his &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; adviser. Michael is standing against the wall in the kitchen to the left side of the stage (which serves as &ldquo;backstage&rdquo; at the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies) when I catch his eye. &ldquo;Lisa?&rdquo; he says. We start to move toward each other and his bodyguards are on me. &ldquo;No! It&rsquo;s O.K.,&rdquo; he says to them forcefully&mdash;in that other voice, not the whispered one, not the public one, but the one he uses when talking, say, to a lawyer or record-company executive. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, speech transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hmm, can you hear me? OK. Thank you very much. Thank you &#39;NSync, I am so proud to call you my friends, you&#39;re all so wonderful. Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is such a tremendous honor and I am so happy to be here. As you can see [pointing at his broken foot], there is not going to be any moonwalking tonight, &#39;cause I broke my foot dancing. I fell down the stairs in California and I broke my foot in two places. So, but I have like six more weeks with this cast, so it&#39;s gonna come off soon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I am honored to be inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It&#39;s a great blessing. For me, the gift of music has been a blessing from God from the time I was a child. So, I first of all would like to thank my parents who bequeathed me that gift. To my mother Katherine and to my father Joseph Jackson, I love you both. To my brothers and to my sisters: thank you, you are all wonderful. Rabbi Shmuley, I love you and thank you for helping me launch Heal The Kids.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Berry Gordy, Berry Gordy, Berry Gordy, Berry Gordy! As it was in the beginning to so many of us, I just want to say thank you. He was so important in our lives. He is really my real inspiration and I owe him so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy Jones, thank you. We talk about a thriller. Quincy, you are incredible. I love you, Quincy. He&#39;s the man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The glamorous and talented and beautiful Diana Ross, who is my second mother. Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tommy Mottola, Sony. I love you. Thank you fans. Thank you. Bye.</span></p></body>
