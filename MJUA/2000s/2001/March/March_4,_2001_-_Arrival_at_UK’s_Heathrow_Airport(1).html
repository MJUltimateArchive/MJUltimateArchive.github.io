He was on crutches after injuring his foot in an accident last week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, 42, went to the store with his friend and actor, Macaulay Culkin, 20, and spent two hours picking up &pound;1,500 worth of music and videos.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His purchases revealed him as a fan of controversial rapper Eminem, alternative rock band Radiohead and Brits winners Coldplay.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also took away an Ali G video, the entire back catalogue of folk-rock act Bread, a box-set of David Attenborough wildlife videos plus a copy of Home Alone 2 - starring Culkin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A HMV spokesman described the star as &quot;incredibly approachable&quot; and said he chatted to the staff and signed autographs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is to address the Oxford Union, a 178-year-old debating institution, on Tuesday alongside Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rabbi Boteach and Jackson are co-founders of the Heal The Kids charity, which is dedicated to &quot;promoting nurturing relationships between parents and children&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Heal The Kids&#39; board members include former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and actress Elizabeth Taylor, a close friend of the singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson and Rabbi Boteach will also appear in London on Monday evening to launch the rabbi&#39;s book, Confessions of A Rabbi and Psychic - a collection of letters between the Jewish leader and Uri Geller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The rabbi is best known for his 1999 book Kosher Sex, which caused controversy among many Orthodox Jews.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s other British engagements this week include attending Uri Geller&#39;s wedding on Wednesday and a fan club event at the Hammersmith Apollo, west London, later the same day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Pain</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson wore his trademark black mask as he arrived in Britain, and winced in pain as he hobbled up an airport staircase before being whisked away by limousine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s painful - I&#39;ve broken two bones in my foot and it hurts,&quot; he told reporters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Asked when he would be dancing again, the father-of-two replied: &quot;I hope very soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">More than 20,000 people have applied to witness Jackson&#39;s Oxford lecture, although only 500 will be allowed into the debating chamber itself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reporters will also be kept away from the address, having to make do with watching a video feed of the lecture from a nearby building.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan Margolis from &ldquo;Sunday Mirror&rdquo; (March 11, 2001) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020209040625/http://home.c2i.net/mjj/michael_jackson_articles_realmanchild.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">):</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So now here we were, travelling out to the airport in a minicab.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s people, a tribe of burly blokes, were already there, of course.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were the squat, silent, watchful American minders, and the drivers, all English and experienced at whisking celebrities around in convoys of blacked-out Mercedes and people-carriers. There was even a photographer employed to video and photograph Michael&#39;s every move for his personal archive.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then the travelling party arrived - Jackson&#39;s young manager, his elderly Lebanese doctor, there to look after the star&#39;s bad foot, plus yet more watchful and burly men.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Michael and his men cleared Customs, the four-car entourage got into position in a public part of the airport, next to people getting out of cars to go on holiday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s physical distress at Heathrow, too, was palpable. He was stressed and exhausted, hobbling on crutches and putting every effort into staying upright.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was too focused on merely walking to say hello to anyone apart from Rabbi Shmuley and, unfortunately for me, his crutches and outstretched leg took up what was going to be my place in his people-carrier. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The fans were out en masse at the back of Michael&#39;s hotel, dozens of them camping in plastic bags on the pavement for a glimpse of their idol.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Michael settled into his suite, I watched his video man going around the crowd, who screamed and wept messages to Michael into his camcorder.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Upstairs in the suite, Michael was seeing his doctor. I wondered when he emerged if he would have any idea who I was. However, he spotted me and greeted me with a funny military salute. I&#39;ve no idea if he really recognised me, but he made a convincing job of making me feel he had.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&#39;s makeup and quiet, shy manner make it seem as if he is detached and unaware of what is going on around him, but he has almost 360-degree vision and rarely misses anything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Everybody, of course, wants to know what this mysterious man is really like. To me, he comes across as childlike, funny, generous spirited, considerate, if quite demanding, and unfailingly polite. He is also unexpectedly gossipy, though never really malevolent. He has, for instance, a pet snake jokily called Madonna - but is always anxious to say how he really thinks the world of his rival for the number one superstar spot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His voice is light and has a distinct Western twang and, although he speaks quietly and dreamily, also laughs loudly and often, especially at any physical joke. People bumping into things and throwing food about crack him up. He hates even the mildest swearing and is always asking questions. He listens carefully, watches you with ever-so-slightly suspicious eyes and ensures by not saying much that he is listened to intently.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael wanted to sleep for a few hours and we agreed to see him later as Shmuley had a list of charity-related matters to discuss. I was to be allowed to tag along as an observer again.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was a knock on the suite door as Michael and his mentor were deep in conversation that evening. Michael asked if I wouldn&#39;t mind going to the door. Outside was Macaulay Culkin, in London for his West End play and here to hang out with Michael. &#39;Hi, there, you big, fat monkey head,&#39; Culkin said to his friend.</span></p></body>
