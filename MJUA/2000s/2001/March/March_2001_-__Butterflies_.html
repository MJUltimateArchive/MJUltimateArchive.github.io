Music&rdquo; (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjjcommunity.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-119698.html"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190701172423/http://www.mjjcommunity.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-119698.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The song was co-written by Marsha Ambrosius, one half of the London bred neo-soul act Floetry, which also includes Natalie Stewart. Stewart was surprised that Jackson invited them to the studio, and asked for their input on the recording of the song. &quot;It was incredible because he asked, he continually, asked, &#39;Marsh, what&#39;s the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? Is this what you were looking for? He was so open,&quot; Stewart told LAUNCH.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It took Ambrosius a few minutes to calm down. &quot;To begin with, I was kinda shook,&quot; Ambrosius told LAUNCH. &quot;Because you don&#39;t realize how you&#39;re going to feel until you&#39;re put in that kind of situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But as I got into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.rap-up.com/2011/02/04/marsha-ambrosius-remembers-michael-jackson-i-was-his-singing-heifer/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rap-Up&rdquo; (February 4, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160323000306/https://www.rap-up.com/2011/02/04/marsha-ambrosius-remembers-michael-jackson-i-was-his-singing-heifer/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not many artists can lay claim to collaborating with a legend before they&rsquo;ve even gotten their feet wet, but they&rsquo;re not Marsha Ambrosius. Ten years ago, the English songstress worked alongside Michael Jackson to create &ldquo;Butterflies,&rdquo; a hit single off the King of Pop&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> album, and has fond memories from the once-in-a-lifetime experience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The former Floetry member played a pivotal role in the song&rsquo;s evolution, but she was just happy to be part of the process. &ldquo;The original record I produced and wrote myself,&rdquo; Marsha tells Rap-Up.com. &ldquo;Andre Harris co-produced it with me. I worked with Michael Jackson on the record here in New York in March 2001. Wow, it&rsquo;s 10 years later and my album is going to be out. I just did the math on that. It&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As a sign of appreciation to the late pop icon, Marsha offers a remixed version of &ldquo;Butterflies&rdquo; on her debut solo LP, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Late Nights &amp; Early Mornings</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. The 33-year-old is grateful for the memories, even years later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Getting the opportunity to work with the best who ever did it, on planet Earth, period, is just a blessing,&rdquo; she shares. &ldquo;For me, it was just paying my respects. For those who don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ve worked with him, but I knew him outside of music. I knew him as a father, as a friend. It was me paying my respects back to him and just thanking him for doing something for me so early in my career I never expected. When I came in the industry at such an early age&mdash;for me, 20, 21&mdash;it was way early to take on as a businesswoman and having Michael Jackson be one of the first artists that you work with as a producer and a writer, I just think that&rsquo;s a blessing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though the public knew Jackson for being reserved and soft-spoken in interviews, behind studio doors he was anything but. &ldquo;Michael Jackson was a practical joker,&rdquo; reveals Marsha. &ldquo;He was just funny. And his laugh just made you laugh. When we were in the studio, his engineer kept calling me a singing heifer. And [Michael] would tell the engineer, &lsquo;You know a heifer is a cow, that&rsquo;s a cow.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll never forget that. So I&rsquo;ll always be Michael Jackson&rsquo;s singing heifer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.bet.com/video/themoniqueshow/guestrewind/monique2112-marsha-s1.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Mo&#39;Nique Show&rdquo; (May 20, 2011)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I wrote &ldquo;Butterflies&rdquo; in 1997 about a boy I had a crush on that worked at McDonald&rsquo;s, and I had no idea that three years later I would be sitting in the studio with the legend himself creating that song together. It was an amazing experience and I have had many more thereafter.</span></p></body>
