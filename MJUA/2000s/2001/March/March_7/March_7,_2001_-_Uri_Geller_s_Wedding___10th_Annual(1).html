Michael was late again (more trouble with that foot, exacerbated when he slipped on it - believe it or not - in a fish and chip shop in Marylebone.) People were sorry, especially for Uri&#39;s wife, Hanna, but then Michael also had to cancel a helicopter trip from the Gellers&#39; out to George Harrison&#39;s home. Harrison, he told me, is the Beatle he is closest to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My 11-year-old daughter shook hands with Michael and pronounced him, &#39;Not as scary as in photos, actually really nice looking.&#39; And I was asked to dance under the wedding canopy with Uri, Shmuley and David Blaine, the American magician - and with the world&#39;s number one song-and-dance man, Michael Jackson, sitting in a chair three feet away, clapping along.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Noting my hippopotamus-like attempts at rhythm, the King Of Pop winked at me. I do not expect to be signed up for his next video any time soon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He, on the other hand, seemed happy, as if some sort of weight had been lifted from his shoulders.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Patti Boulaye, singer/actress/artist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/patti-boulaye-friend-michael-jackson-fell-love-spirit/"><span class="cs8567212B">Telegraph (published by Mick Brown)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This photograph (Image 001) was taken at the renewal of Uri&rsquo;s wedding vows to his wife, Hanna, after 25 years of marriage. It was in a marquee next to Uri&rsquo;s house in Berkshire. Michael Jackson was best man. There were 100 guests there, including people such as Dave Stewart, Barry Gibb, Sir David Frost&ndash; a lot of celebrities.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was two hours late because he had to go to hospital &ndash; he had a fractured leg. So, as you can imagine, those who drank were pretty tanked by the time he arrived.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Michael finally showed up we were told, &lsquo;No photographs, no videos, please&rsquo; &ndash; and, of course, as soon as he walked in, everyone&rsquo;s cameras were out. But Michael being Michael really didn&rsquo;t mind. He was bopping away to the music. It was a very funny wedding. I don&rsquo;t drink, so I could just observe all of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When I look at this picture (Image 001), I remember a very happy day. Every day with Michael was a happy day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">10th Annual &quot;Michael Jackson Day&quot;:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you very much... for that wonderful reception. I&rsquo;m overjoyed; I&rsquo;m humbled by the incredible entertainment tonight. It was just beautiful; I love you from the bottom of my heart. I&rsquo;m, um, working on the new album... 2 more months! Adrian Grant you&rsquo;re incredible, the entertainment... and I love you all from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.</span></p></body>
