This was most likely around the time that Michael met Sisq&oacute;.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Sisq&oacute;, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/849522/Rapper-Sisqo-impressed-with-Michael-Jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">Deseret News (June 23, 2001)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shaking Michael Jackson&#39;s hand was nothing like Sisqo imagined.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The rapper, who was nominated for a Grammy this year for the &quot;Thong Song,&quot; talked during a Thursday appearance on MTV&#39;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; about meeting Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;That was cool, man. When I first walked in, he was chillin&#39; with his son, Prince,&quot; Sisqo said. &quot;I reached out to shake his hand and I thought he&#39;d be kinda cold and clammy. . . .</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was kinda rough, like he&#39;d been lifting weights or something.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-big-brother-sisqo-reveals-192671"><span class="cs8567212B">Mirror (January 26, 2012)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Celebrity Big Brother housemate Sisqo has revealed that Michael Jackson once flew him out because he wanted to meet the Thong Song singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a conversation with Stephanie, who has also met the King of Pop, Sisqo explained that Michael sent for him to meet up at an arcade in West Virginia back in 2001.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said: &quot;I will never forget that day. He was my hero. He introduced me to his kids, not Blanket but Paris and Prince Michael, and he took me to an arcade and he had the whole arcade shut down just for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I will tell you two things about that man. One his voice was not that high pitched and two he was not a frail dude like everyone made out. When he shook my hand I could feel power.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84"><a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.vibe.com/2014/09/interview-sisqo-jagged-edge-fight-michael-jackson/sisqo-vibe-interview-2/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; Magazine (September 23, 2014)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vibe</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: What was meeting Michael Jackson like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sisq&oacute;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I was maybe 4 or 5 years old when I saw Michael Jackson do the moonwalk and that&rsquo;s when I was like that&rsquo;s what I want to do. Michael Jackson flew me out to meet him in 2001 and he told me, &lsquo;Man you&rsquo;re really talented and you&rsquo;re going to go very far in this industry.&rsquo; To be honest, after he told me that I was the shit, I didn&rsquo;t really care about doing another album (laughs).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vibe</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Like on some &ldquo;Nobody could tell me nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sisq&oacute;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: They couldn&rsquo;t and you know what&rsquo;s the worst part about that? If you noticed after 2001, [there was] this negative connotation of who I am as an artist. That nobody could tell me nothing. Even though I never really said that, that may have been the aura I was giving off because I was like, &lsquo;Michael Jackson flew me out.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vibe</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Where did he fly you out to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sisq&oacute;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It was Virginia Beach and me, him and Teddy Riley were down there together and hung out. I met his kids and that was when Teddy had worked with me on my second album. He did my first single &ldquo;Can I Live&rdquo; and I got the photo too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Vibe</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: So you mean to tell me Michael Jackson really bumped &ldquo;Thong Song&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sisq&oacute;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: He clearly knew my music but we didn&rsquo;t talk about that. I was just wondering why he wanted to meet me, like, &lsquo;Dude you&rsquo;re freaking Michael Jackson.&rsquo; Everybody else goes to meet him. And just for the record, a lot of the preconceived notions of who Michael Jackson was as a person were literally upside down. His voice was deeper and when I went to shake his hand, he gave me a pound and he&rsquo;s like a sturdy dude. He seemed like he could whip your ass for real. He was brolic. He was the first dragon. I&rsquo;m the last dragon.</span></p></body>
