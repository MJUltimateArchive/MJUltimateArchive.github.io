You&#39;ve been very kind, but I&#39;m not prepared to answer any questions. I&#39;m very sorry,&quot; a very Michael-sounding voice told reporter Carter Evans over the phone.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Tell Norfolk I love them, OK?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of course, details about what Jackson might be doing here were hard to come by. But sources within the area&#39;s music community said that Jackson, who in the 1980s made wearing one glove fashionable, has been in town doing some recording for a new album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s not as far-fetched as it sounds.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">First off, Jackson has visited Virginia Beach at least once before. Teddy Riley, who leads the group BLACKstreet and operates the studio Future in Virginia Beach, produced tracks for Jackson&#39;s 1991 album &quot;Dangerous.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Riley has said that Jackson has visited his studio, although the star then had better luck keeping his movements under wraps.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Secondly, Hampton Roads has hip cachet in the world of R&amp;B music because local hip-hop stars Missy Elliott and Timbaland are still putting songs on the charts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How did WAVY reporter Evans manage to get his apparent scoop? It was surprisingly easy. Hearing wild rumors about Jackson being spotted at Barnes &amp; Noble near Pembroke Mall in Virginia Beach on Monday, radio station WNVZ-FM (104.5) asked listeners to call in with Michael Jackson sightings.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Incredibly, someone called up offering the name of the hotel where the star was staying, even the specific room number.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">WAVY and the radio station teamed up. At first, Evans didn&#39;t take the story all that seriously. But once he started reporting, he couldn&#39;t believe his good luck.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;At the station, we were talking, and we said, &#39;You know, this is the water cooler story of the day.&#39; So I started digging. And everywhere I dug I was striking gold.&quot;</span></p></body>
