Later, Jackson wanted to make an acting DVD with Brando. The project fizzled because of the enormous cost, Schaffel said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There were several messages from Jackson saying Brando wanted to know what was going on with the project.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">June 2001 voicemails to Marc Schaffel, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/12/ng.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nancy Grace&rdquo; (Jul 12, 2006)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170608182347/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/12/ng.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: ...Marc, it&#39;s Michael Jackson calling. Don&#39;t forget for the studio we&#39;re building at Neverland we agreed to put the editing bay for filmmakers and a whole editing compound area for the side for rehearsal. That&#39;s important to remember that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I want to give Nicky your number, and Nicky will call you directly, OK? Nicky will call you, also. Thanks, bye.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Marc, we must -- Marlon Brando has been pushing. He&rsquo;s a wonderful man. He&#39;s a god. We have to get this done. We want it done before Christmas. Put together a business plan. The whole thing is fine for TV. He just wants to make a big deal. He wants a lot of money. And we would own it together. We would form our own company. Start putting that together so when we see him -- when I see him, I can just give him a presentation that we have been busy working.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He really wants it. I mean, I think that&#39;s there&#39;s -- maybe he&#39;s not going to be living too much longer. That&#39;s what it is, I think. Please, Marc, get this done. Let&#39;s get the jive thing done. I need that money for the house. Let&#39;s move mountains.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The album is going to be turned in. Sony&#39;s going crazy. So we are looking good. I hope to talk to you soon. I&#39;ll see you today at the studio at 3:30. I love you very much. Thank you. Bye.</span></p></body>
