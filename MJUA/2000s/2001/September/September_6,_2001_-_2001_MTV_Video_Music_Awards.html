He performed in front of a U.S. audience for the first time in years when he joined &#39;NSYNC onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Toward the end of the group&#39;s performance of &quot;Pop,&quot; the words &quot;King of Pop&quot; appeared on a giant Etch a Sketch, only to be replaced by a silhouette of Jackson. As the oversized drawing device was elevated, Jackson, dressed in a white V-neck T-shirt and a black shirt and pants, came onstage and started to do the robot, pop-lock and show off his often-imitated spins and feet shuffling, but he did not sing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s only acknowledgement to the audience, which gave him a standing ovation, was a single point of the finger.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">CBS News</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It wasn&#39;t listed on the program and it lasted less than a minute, but Michael Jackson&#39;s surprise performance with &#39;N Sync was the most talked-about moment of MTV&#39;s Video Music Awards.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fatboy Slim&#39;s six awards for &ldquo;Weapon of Choice,&rdquo; and &#39;N Sync&#39;s four for &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; were overshadowed Thursday night by Jackson&#39;s brief appearance, which came at the end of &#39;N Sync&#39;s performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After a giant Etch-A-Sketch drew his frame, Jackson emerged, doing his trademark, gravity-defying moves. Afterward, he received a standing ovation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ben Stiller, Sheryl Crow and Sean &ldquo;P. Diddy&rdquo; Combs were among the stars who considered Jackson the evening&#39;s highlight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I thought he did a good job pop-locking,&rdquo; rapper Snoop Dogg said after the show.</span></p></body>
