Those are our parents.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson says that he hopes to have individual artists take on the verses with all the guests singing together on the chorus. &quot;I want the whole world to sing it, to bring us together as a world,&quot; he says. &quot;Because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over. And we need peace, we need giving, we need love, we need unity.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson debuted the song two years ago as part of a pair of &quot;Michael Jackson and Friends&quot; concerts that benefited the Nelson Mandela Children&#39;s Fund, the Red Cross and Unesco. Jackson hopes to enlist additional stars to perform the song and plans to record and release it as soon as possible.</span></p></body>
