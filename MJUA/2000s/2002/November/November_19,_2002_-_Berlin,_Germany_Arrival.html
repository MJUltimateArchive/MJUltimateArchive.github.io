The baby loves to be swung around, and I know you could see the sheer part of the curtain. It&#39;s a game for him and I know why you coverd his face. All celebrity kids are shielded from being recognized for an obvious reason - they&#39;re under constant threat from would-be kidnappers. I went through it as a child actress, Michael, and i know you did, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael, I have never seen a better or more loving parent. You are bringing your children up with singleminded love and manage to gently discipline them, as well. I have never seen two better behaved or lovable children. (including my own)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You are an exemplary father. You would no more take a chance with your children&#39;s safety than fly to the moon. If people could only see you with the children, and the time you spend with them, and the love. Not just pretty clothes and gifts, but pure unconditional love. And they respond so completely in kind.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If only you would let people see the real you more, but I understand how shy you are and you understand also how shy I am, but we are both professionals. I did my best to keep my kids away from the public eye, and they have grown up so beautifully. I am so proud of them, and yours are kids I am proud to know. They are so beautiful inside and out, like you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Don&#39;t ever let them get you down, Michael. You&#39;re loved by too many, especially this kid. I love you just as much as I always have and understand you just as much as I always have. Don&#39;t hide. You haven&#39;t done anythging to be ashamed of. Be proud of how you are bringing up your children. God knows I am.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love you with all my heart, and because I know you so well, I will always understand where others may not. But you know something: Screw the others!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">All my love,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Elizabeth</span></p></body>
