How are you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Becker: I&rsquo;m well].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you so much for the nice words. Oh boy. Sorry, I have to wear these reading glasses. Oh Jesus...here we go. Dear Dr. Burda Ladies and gentlemen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I have wonderful memories of my visits to Germany. Coming back to Berlin...Berlin, a city so full of energy - it&rsquo;s very special to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Berlin, ich liebe dich (I love you)! September 11 has changed our world. Not long ago the Berlin wall came down. But recently new walls have been built. In 1989, people in Germany said: &ldquo;Wir sind ein Volk.&rdquo; We are Germans. We are Armenians. French, Italian, Russian, American, Asian, African... many other nationalities. We are Christians, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu. We are black, we are white. We are a community of some many differences, so complex and yet so simple. We do not need to have war!!!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And to the children of Germany I want to say this: We need you! The world needs you! Please go for your dreams. Whatever your ideals...you can become whatever you want to become. Become an astronaut or famous scientist, famous doctors. And of course become an artist and maybe you get a Bambi award like me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I want you to know that I love Germany and that you have a very special place in my heart.

Michael put up for auction a silver sequined jacket worn by himself at the 2002 American Music Awards ($ 15,950) and an autographed white trademark fedora ($ 2,303). These were auctioned on eBay with proceeds going to &ldquo;Off-Road-Kids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Organiser of the Bambi Award and publisher of German magazine &lsquo;Bunte&rsquo; Dr.Hubert Burda met Michael in his room at the Estrel Hotel before the Bambi Awards ceremony. Speaking of his support for the homeless children the world over Burda said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He is not only the idol, he is not only the king, he is someone superior, gives encourage, encourages them to go forward and to fight for a better life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael thanked Burda for his kind words.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Prince Jackson, son, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/2U_mlg9l8Fg"><span class="cs8567212B">2011 &ldquo;Bambi Awards&rdquo; interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Host: You have been to Germany before with your dad. Do you remember any of that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Prince: I remember that when he got the award he brought it in and I always wanted to play with it because it was such a shiny little deer. But he didn&#39;t allow me to because it was a very important award for him and he valued it a lot as it was a recognition of his charity work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;Bunte&rdquo; Magazine Interview:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &ldquo;Bunte&rdquo; magazine interview, from MJNI (November 28, 2002) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.michaeljackson.ch/2002an.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130218171820/http://www.michaeljackson.ch/2002an.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t like pop music,&quot; the King of Pop has told Bunte, a German magazine which interviewed Michael Jackson when he wasin Berlin last week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The comments come in what many are assuming to be a tongue-in-cheek answer to the fact that he was spotted buying two classical music CDs, but no pop, during a shopping excursion in Berlin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reuters of 27th November quote Michael further from the interview:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;d like to go shopping again for CDs in Berlin.
