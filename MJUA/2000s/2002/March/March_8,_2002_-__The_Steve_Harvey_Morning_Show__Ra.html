And I didn&#39;t come on the air and tell anybody, because I considered that just a private thing between us, you know. I didn&#39;t go out and go, &quot;Man, I was in Michael Jackson&#39;s trailer&quot;. You know, the brotha invited me to his trailer, and I met his kids. Great kids, man. Michael, great kids, man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Thank you very much, sir.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Can I pay you this compliment?

And got something else for you too, Mike. I talked to your personal assistant, I got a new DVD out, I&#39;m sending you that. You have that today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Wow! Cool! Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Playa, playa, thank you Mike. Mike Jackson on the phone! I don&#39;t even know what to ask!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hey, Mike I got another one for you!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yea?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Hey man, let me ask you this question. When you were performing on the 30th anniversary special... Did you have an emotional moment when you and your brothers was on stage? Cause there was a moment when you were performing where you kneel down and you stayed there and your brothers were looking at you like &#39;OK Mike, come on&#39;. Was that real, dog?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: It&#39;s always real, and I take that moment and I pray not to cry, and I usually do. But it all goes back for me, you know, to conception, you know, when we were really little babies and children. And now to see all the adulation and notoriety, and it&#39;s just a work from God, and it all goes through me real fast.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Oh yea...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: It&#39;s a blessing, and I just break down and I cry at that moment. I try not to show it to the audience, but I can&#39;t help it. You know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yea. Well, I saw it and I thought that was real you know. I think, man, that people, when they see these things in you brotha, I think that that allows them to see a glimpse of the real Michael Jackson that oftentimes only your closest friends get to see. And I thought that that was a great moment, man. I enjoyed it, that was my favorite part of the show. I said, &quot;If I ever talk to this bro&#39;, I&#39;m going to ask him about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: That was hot man, that was real hot. Hey man, there&#39;s so much man, that we can talk about. Your career and everything. Your sister called the radio station.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Oh yeah?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Janet called, when did Janet call?... First of all Michael, let me introduce you to my co-hosts on the show: Shirley Strawberry and Dominique De&#39;Creme, cause they are busting to say hi.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: [laugh] Good morning Michael!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Good morning!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: Hi Michael!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: How are you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: Great!

Then you drop &#39;Butterflies&#39;...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: Oh!

Uh, it&#39;s mainly these other 2 girls who mainly composed that one.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Wow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: And um, I think they&#39;re British. Yea, they&#39;re British girls...They&#39;re black British girls, and they were just phenomenal. And I thought it was something that I just really, really liked and we did some kind of counter hooks and lines, painted it with different sounds and everything, different colors, and so we produced it, and I produced it, and just created something that was just acceptable and it ended up going on the album. &#39;Cause I&#39;ll do at least over 100 songs, until I come up with about 20 or 30 that I like.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: No doubt...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: And I&#39;ll decipher it down...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Wow, 100 songs, dog, before you come up with 20 or 30 you like?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yea, it was more this time, actually, than 100.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Gee...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: Well, he is Michael Jackson, you know....</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: He&#39;s Bad...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: He&#39;s Dangerous....he&#39;s working day and night, that&#39;s what he is...Yes he is!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yeah.

I speak at prisons across the country often times, and I was at Pritchard&#39;s Detention Center out here, and one of the brothas that was locked away, he says, &#39;Steve, the love you be givin&#39; Michael Jackson on the air — he said, if you ever, ever talk to him, tell him that we up in here, man, we been feeling his music for a long time&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Wow, that&#39;s beautiful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yea man, that&#39;s a great compliment, man. For what you&#39;ve been to people, Mike, for all these years, man... I mean, brotha, I don&#39;t know if any body&#39;s ever said thank you to you for the way you put it down, for all of the music you gave us that&#39;s still in our hearts, man, and I don&#39;t know if nobody ever said thank you to you man?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Well God bless you, that&#39;s so beautiful. I appreciate it. It&#39;s not easy being in my position, because it creates so much sensationalism and tabloids, people lie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Come on man...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: They create rumors and stories and none of it&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: And it&#39;s very, very difficult, you know, it&#39;s not easy, it&#39;s very hard. And you end up, you hurt sometimes, &#39;cause you try to be as resilient as possible.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: But it&#39;s very, very difficult because there&#39;s tabloids and lies...they hate — they&#39;re jealous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yeah, I dig it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: ...When you read that stuff, know it&#39;s a lie, don&#39;t believe it. Burn it. We should have a tabloid burning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve/Shirley/Dominique: [laugh]...Yea, dig it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: We should have a tabloid burning. Make a mountain out of them and just throw the match....cause they...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yea, man!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: &hellip;&#39;cause they just hate to see us grow and build and build, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. They can, but it&#39;s ok. But, what can I do but to reinforce the talent God gave us, and that&#39;s all I wanted to do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yea...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Just share the love and gifts of entertainment. That&#39;s all I want to do. I don&#39;t want to hurt anybody.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: No. That&#39;s real, and man, you know what man....um, I&#39;m just going to say this man, um, I talked with your mom off the air before through Jermaine...he and I had a conversation on the air, and then he called me off the air and I was talking to you mother, Mrs. Jackson, off the air...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: She&#39;s wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Aw, man, your mother is....and I gave her her propers too. I told Ms. Jackson, I said a phenomenal job you&#39;ve done in raising as many talented children that you have and still maintain them as a family. And she was uh, thanking me because I had came forward on your behalf on more than one occasion, concerning several issues, man, that were just totally false about you. And I prompted everybody to go out and get a copy of the GQ article, from 1994.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: Oh, yea...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: And uh, GQ had a lot of back issues re-ordered because of this. And um, a lot of people read the article and found out the real truth behind a lot of things that were so false man, and um, your mom was thanking me for saying that on the radio, man. And I just wanted to say man, that there are a lot of people out here man, that really feel you playa, that really wish that they could just feel you some more, and a phone call like this Mike. I gotta tell you playa, it goes a long way, man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Well thank you so much. I don&#39;t do it often at all. I never do it, I never do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Thank you Mike.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: This is a first.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: [laughs] Yea!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: It is the first and thank you! Wow!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: For you, I&#39;m happy to do it for you. And it&#39;s from the bottom of my heart. You were so kind, and wonderful to me. Somebody, people used to tell me different places; there&#39;s this guy who talks about you everyday!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve/Shirley/Dominique: [laugh]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: ...And I&#39;d go, &#39;Who is it?&#39;, and they&#39;d go, &#39;His name is Steve&#39;. I&#39;d go &#39;Steve&#39;...and then I saw the Kings of Comedy show, and I go &#39;This is the guy?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve/Shirley/Dominique: [laugh]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: And I said, &#39;Oh my god&#39;, I said, &#39;I&#39;m a fan of him now!&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Yeah, and it was...and you gave me a call and it was real crazy. &#39;Cause going to see Mike ain&#39;t no...you don&#39;t just walk up and go &#39;Hey, Mike, how&#39;s it going&#39;. No no, you gotta go through some channels. But it was great, man, and you helped me out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hey Mike, listen man, um, can you tell us exactly what is Never-Never Land? Can you clear that up for the listeners?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: NEVERland!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Sure, sure...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Oh, I thought it was Never-Neverland...but that ain&#39;t right, no...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: That&#39;s ok too if you want to call it Never-Neverland. It&#39;s just a serene and tranquil place, to just relax and enjoy yourself and leave your troubled mind and the things that irritate you in your heart and your soul, behind.

Hey Mike man, you invite me out to Neverland but let me ask you this.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My wife and I, we got a foundation, it&#39;s called the Steve and Muriel Harvey Foundation, and we been trying to put together man, you know there are so many children out here in the LA school districts that just don&#39;t have books. They just do not have a book, man...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Wow.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: ...and they- with all the budget cuts that goin&#39; down. Most of these schools that&#39;s in really, really impoverished neighborhoods and they just not getting the education.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We, for example, Mike, I walked into classrooms with children in it, where they had 38 children, 23 books...no, 23 desks, and 8 books. With 38 kids, 23 desks and just 8 books, and it broke my heart man. So I took some news cameras down there. So, instead of having me come to Neverland, because I know it would be great for me, but, if my foundation got together a bus of really, really, uh, inner-city kids, man, that were real young and had never been out of their neighborhood and never saw anything great, if I could arrange it through your people man, if I paid for the bus and everything... If we could get a bus load of kids man....</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: You got it, we&#39;ll do it. That&#39;s what we do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley/Dominique: Oh! Wow!

Some of these kids never been to Beverly Hills out here. If we could get that worked out man, at the top of the year, my foundation would happily pay for the buses and the lunches, but I know you&#39;d take care of them out there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Of course!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: I think that would be great...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Wow, I&#39;d love to do it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: Cool that&#39;s what I mean man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I&#39;d love to do it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: That&#39;s the bomb deal right there.

Regardless as to what you hear in the media, what you read about, the tabloids, that garbage, they print stuff about everybody false all the time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: False, false.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: They just... this cat right here is one of the nicest people in this business, and been that way a long time.

And I mean man, it was very revealing, and I was stunned, but then not really, cause I know how people are. &#39;Cause I only get a taste of it, and I ain&#39;t even, I ain&#39;t even Michael Jackson. Plus Mike, I&#39;m dangerous. When you come in here, I cuss, spit, I do all kinds of things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: [laughs]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Steve: I got friends in low places.
