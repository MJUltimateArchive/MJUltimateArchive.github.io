If that happens I am very happy. Giving joy makes one happy. Unfortunately there are many children that are not happy. In Germany and in other countries.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During Christmas this is especially hard for those children because it is on Christmas when they see what they miss. For some it may be just a small present, for some it may be a warm meal, for some it may be a family, for some it may be just a little bit of love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That is why I need you! I need your help. Let us work together and help those children. Let us reach out to those who are alone - Let us all tell them: &ldquo;You are not alone&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This year it is I, only I speaking to you, children in Germany and sending you a few little gifts. If you help me, then next year, we will do the same but in many more countries. We will speak together - maybe we will sing together - and we will give gifts together. Let us think big. Let us find many people to join our effort.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here and all over Europe and then all over the world. We can do it! I know we can do it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To all of the grown-ups I like to say this: To us, so many things seem important. Sometimes, we think we are important. We are not important. Nothing is more important than our children! They are the future. They can heal the world. It is our obligation to be there for them. To advise them. To motivate them. To help them and to love them. Let us encourage them to go for their dreams. And let us as parents, friends and relatives help them to have good dreams.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I look forward to the new year, to working with you children and to create an organization that will help other children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I promise, I promise you, if you come along, it will make you feel good and it will be so much fun!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Merry Christmas! I love you from the bottom of my heart!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thank you so much!</span></p></body>
