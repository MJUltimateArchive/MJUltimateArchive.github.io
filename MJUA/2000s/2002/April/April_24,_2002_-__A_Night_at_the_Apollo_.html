The occasion was a Democratic National Committee voter drive/fundraiser... Before Michael came out, Tony Bennett crooned, Chris Tucker joked, Bill Clinton pontificated and the Harlem Boys Choir kept their distance (hey &mdash; just kidding).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While the show was in progress, members of a choir dressed like they were putting on a PTA show about the United Nations spent an agonizing amount of time on the third floor of the Apollo pre-recording an augmented version of &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; to be used with Jackson later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Unfortunately, that never came to pass. Since the Apollo show was running long, the DNC cut that number. Jackson performed to a pre-taped version of &ldquo;Dangerous,&rdquo; then did &ldquo;Black or White&rdquo; mostly live, and finished with... &ldquo;Heal the World.&rdquo; Instead of a fourth song, he showed the [HIStory teaser video].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was no denying that Jackson&rsquo;s appearance in the small (1,300 seats) Apollo generated heat. Despite everything, he is still an electrifying performer. The crowd was happy to see him, and he obliged them. After &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; &mdash; well danced, but mechanically portrayed &mdash; Jackson must have realized that he needed to act human. He made one of his famous &ldquo;woo-hoos&rdquo; into the mike, and sounded real. His voice is intact. He sang &ldquo;Black or White&rdquo; with enthusiasm and grit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...After the show, Jackson took pictures with Bill Clinton and with hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael was brought into this DNC fundraiser by commercial real estate broker James Meiskin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Meantime, a smattering of celebs did show up for the Apollo show, all impressed with the theater&rsquo;s glittering refurbishment. The Apollo really is a New York treasure, and it was great to see it filled with life. Among the notables: actor Joe Pantoliano, singer Ruben Blades (who performed), Johnnie Cochran, Cicely Tyson, Don Cornelius and Diana Ross, who made a surprise appearance at the end of Jackson&rsquo;s show.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I did enjoy meeting the great boxer Joe Frazier, looking dandy in a fedora. I asked him, &ldquo;Did you ever see the movie Ali?&rdquo; Frazier hesitated until a friend reminded him he had. &ldquo;Actually I slept through a lot of it!&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Frazier did, however, miss the scene in the Apollo lobby when an overzealous security guard threw a well-dressed man of about 60 &mdash; who&#39;d paid for his ticket and had it with him &mdash; out into the street. The man, who is a regular at the Apollo and a professional person, never managed to get back inside. He was literally chased outside by a phalanx of security people &mdash; quite frightening, and very Kafkaesque, to watch. That&#39;s one problem that may have to be tweaked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This surreal night ended at around 1 a.m. at Elaine&rsquo;s, where the great character actor Dabney Coleman was holding court. A nice young woman who&rsquo;d had too much to drink approached his table and pointed. &ldquo;Were you in You&rsquo;ve Got Mail?&rdquo; she asked of the Golden Globe winner who&rsquo;s starred in his own series (Buffalo Bill, Slap Maxwell) and countless movies (Nine to Five being the best). Getting her answer (which was yes), she returned to her pals at the bar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I thought you handled that well,&rdquo; I said to Coleman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t at all,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If I had, she&rsquo;d still be here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was that kind of night.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bill Clinton, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://nbc25news.com/archive/bill-clinton-on-haiti-trip-praises-michael-jackson-10-23-2015-030942897"><span class="cs8567212B">Associated Press (July 7, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190529164133/https://nbc25news.com/archive/bill-clinton-on-haiti-trip-praises-michael-jackson-10-23-2015-030942897"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He basically helped save my party from terrible financial distress, so he was very kind to me personally.</span></p></body>
