The crowd went wild. He travelled up Great Marlborough Street and Oxford Street.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It&#39;s the happiest I&#39;ve seen him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, &ldquo;Killer Thriller&rdquo; party speech, transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I want to thank all the great, incredible talents. [DJ plays &quot;Speechless&quot;] As long as you play the music, I want to dance! I want to thank this guy for a wonderful performance [referring to Ernest Valentino] I thought Bryton McClure was amazing, too. He&#39;s a great singer as well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyway, I first wanted to say, I really don&#39;t like to talk that much. I really don&#39;t. I prefer performing than talking.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I really want you to know what I say. The tradition of great performers: from Sammy Davis Junior, James Brown, to Jackie Wilson, to Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly. The story is usually the same though. These guys worked really hard, and they&#39;re crabbed, for the story ends the same. They are usually broken, torn and usually just sad, because the companies take advantage of them, they really do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And being the artist that I am, at Sony I&#39;ve generated several billion dollars for Sony, several billion. They really thought that my mind is always on music and dancing. It usually is, but they never thought that this performer - myself - would out think them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So, we can&#39;t let them get away with what they&#39;re trying to do, because now I&#39;m a free agent. I just owe Sony one more album. It&#39;s just a box set, really, with two new songs which I&#39;ve written ages ago. Because for every album that I record, I write - literally, I&#39;m telling you the truth - I write at least 120 songs every album I do. So I can do the box set, just giving them any two songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I&#39;m leaving Sony, a free agent, owning half of Sony. I own half of Sony&#39;s Publishing. I&#39;m leaving them, and they&#39;re very angry at me, because I just did good business, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So the way they get revenge is to try and destroy my album. But I&#39;ve always said, you know, art - good art - never dies. Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Tommy Mottola is a devil! I&#39;m not supposed to say what I&#39;m going to say right now, but I have let you know this. [Points to crowd] Please don&#39;t videotape what I am going to say, ok? Turn it off, please. Do it, do it, I don&#39;t mind! Tape it!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mariah Carey, after divorcing Tommy, came to me crying. Crying. She was crying so badly I had to hold her. She said to me, &quot;This is an evil man, and Michael, this man follows me.&quot; He taps her phones, and he&#39;s very, very evil. She doesn&#39;t trust him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We have to continue our drive until he is terminated. We can&#39;t allow him to do this to great artists, we just can&#39;t.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I just wanted to let you know, I appreciate everything you&#39;ve done, you&#39;ve been amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You&#39;re so loyal! [Scanning the audience] Diana, everybody, Waldo, all the people here! I love you all. You&#39;ve been amazing, I love you!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Worldpop.com (June 17, 2002) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190124163100/http://prince.org/msg/8/16485?pr"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror archive</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael Jackson has confirmed that after over 25 years on the label, he has parted with his record company Sony. Speaking at a Michael Jackson fan club day at London&#39;s Equinox club on Saturday, Jackson appeared before thousands of screaming fans and made a surprisingly eloquent speech about the nature of record company politics and artist contracts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;It&#39;s true I have left Sony,&#39; Jackson told the fans. Referring to the perceived poor promotion of his last album, Invincible, Jackson said: &#39;A record company leaves you no choice when they virtually give up on promoting your album. But I&#39;ve always said that great art never dies and this isn&#39;t the end of Michael Jackson.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is rumoured to be discussing releasing his next album on a label set up by Harrods owner, Mohamed Al Fayed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sony Music have released a statement confirming Jackson&#39;s split with the label</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s official website, www.michaeljackson.com hasn&#39;t been updated for over a year and a scheduled release for his next single, Unbreakable, was recently cancelled by his record label.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the US, Jackson recently aligned himself with the Rev Al Sharpton and attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr, who have formed a coalition to investigate whether artists are being financially exploited by record labels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;Record companies have to start treating their artists with respect, honor and financial justice, said Jackson at the launch of the coalition. &#39;Therefore, I am proud to join this coalition which represents all artists.&#39;</span></p></body>
