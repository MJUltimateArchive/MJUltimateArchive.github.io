He really could have FedExed the stuff and been through with it. Then his ad-libs at the end, he was fine with that. It was a lot of stuff that made me feel confident in it. The same way that &#39;P.Y.T.&#39; was, I was hoping &#39;All Eyez on Me&#39; would be &mdash; more relaxing and you could have a good time. It&#39;s not based on anything emotional or anything sad.
