The event netted $200,000, to be divided equally between the museum and AIDS foundation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Taylor and Jackson arrived fashionably late at the dinner--filet mignon and raspberry souffle whipped up by Mark&#39;s restaurant--staged in the art-filled home of Barbara Alexander Stiles and Thomas B. Stiles II. &quot;Elizabeth, the party was last night,&quot; guest Merv Griffin quipped upon the star&#39;s arrival.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With Jackson standing quietly at her side, the violet-eyed actress mingled briefly with fans before being whisked by limousine to the museum. There, she stood before a sold-out crowd, praising her friend Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS in 1985, and pledging her ongoing support for AIDS research and patient services. &quot;I, for one, will never stop my personal fight against AIDS, and I ask the same of you.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Feb. 9 tribute to Hudson, a frequent visitor to Laguna Beach, seemed like a natural, observed Beverly Hills dermatologist Arnold Klein, co-chairman of the benefit with Jack Kenefick and Al Roberts. &quot;Rock was grateful that the AIDS Services Foundation was being founded [in 1985]. And Elizabeth has been a driving force for fundraising.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Guests also included Penny Marshall; Ken Jillson; Jose Eber; Mark De Palma; Anita May Rosenstein; David Canzoneri; Santina Davies; Ray and Beverly Redfern; and Mark and Donna Merhab.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-xpm-2009-07-03-cpt-jackson070309-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (July 3, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190611181717/https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-xpm-2009-07-03-cpt-jackson070309-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">AIDS was decimating the arts when Hollywood and television celebrities came to Laguna in the early 2000s to help raise funds for the Laguna Art Museum and AIDS Services Foundation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson escorted Elizabeth Taylor to the first Art for AIDS fundraiser Feb. 9, 2002 at the museum.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dr. Arnie Klein, Jackson&#39;s dermatologist and friend of ASF founder Al Roberts, had arranged for Jackson, Taylor, Penny Marshall and Merv Griffin to attend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Taylor was one of the most outspoken celebrities helping to raise awareness of AIDS. And yes, her eyes were every bit as beautiful as reported, violet and double lashed. But her hair was a surprising blond.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although heavily made up, Jackson looked better in person than he did in photographs and his demeanor toward Taylor was endearing. He held Taylor&#39;s bejeweled hand throughout the press conference, his slender, costumed body curved protectively around her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was a rocking event here at the museum, complete with the Orange County Sheriff and lots of traffic,&quot; museum director Bolton Colburn said. &quot;I was amazed that Michael was willing to come out to support the arts and AIDS like he did. It was truly amazing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://mjjtime.blogspot.com/2011/02/today-in-mjj-history_09.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Michael Jackson For All Time&rdquo; blog</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (archived) (only source, so take with a grain of salt)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the beginning of the event commemorative t-shirts signed by various stars including Michael, Bob Dylan, Madonna, Ringo Starr, Sharon Stone, Halle Berry and others were auctioned. Michael&#39;s, which was signed twice, went for an amazing $ 700, well above the average. The gala was expected to raise $150,000.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was wearing a black suit with white trim and Elizabeth was adorned with jewels. They arrived late, to the strains of &quot;Elizabeth, I Love You&quot;. He held Taylor&rsquo;s bejeweled hand throughout the press conference, his slender, costumed body curved protectively around her.</span></p></body>
