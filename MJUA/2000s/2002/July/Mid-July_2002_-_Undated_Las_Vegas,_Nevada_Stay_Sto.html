Michael was shopping with his children, but word had spread all over. I was with my assistant, Shirley Washington and we heard about it from the valet who took our car: &ldquo;Michael Jackson is in the mall!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley took control. I was more interested in finding the men&rsquo;s room.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley remembers: &ldquo;When I saw the huge crowd that had gathered, I pushed my way to the front where the security guards were and told them, &lsquo;Tell Michael, Eddie Holland is here and wants to say hello to him. He went up in the glass elevator to where Michael was and come down a few minutes later and asked, &#39;Where is he?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &quot;I&#39;ll go get him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Eddie: It was the last thing I wanted to do. I didn&rsquo;t want to disturb him, so I walked away. Of course, Shirley then had to run halfway across the mall to find me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shirley continues, &ldquo;I returned five minutes later with Eddie and the guard escorted us through the crowd - Eddie said it was like Moses parting the Red Sea to allow us to walk through. &ldquo;I was so excited I could hardly breathe, but all Michael wanted to do was introduce us to everyone - &#39;This is the great Eddie Holland, the songwriter. He&#39;s a genius!&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He introduced us to his two children, Prince and Paris, and invited us, with Brian, to visit him at Neverland. Eddie said we&#39;d only go if he was going to be there, but Michael said sure, he&#39;d be there and even gave us his private numbers to call him. Unfortunately, before arrangements could be made, Neverland was raided, time passed, and it never felt like the right time to call...&quot;</span></p></body>
