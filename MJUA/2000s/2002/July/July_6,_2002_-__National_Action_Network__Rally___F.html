Thank you, Johnnie Cochran. Thank you for inviting me here and all the lovely people here tonight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember a long time ago, in Indiana&mdash;of course I was like six or seven years old&mdash;I had a dream that I wanted to be a performer, an entertainer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whenever I&rsquo;d couldn&rsquo;t get to to sleep at night, or my mother would wake me up and shout, &ldquo;Michael, Michael, James Brown is on 2! Turn it on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;d jump out of bed and I&rsquo;d just stare at the screen and he&rsquo;d twist and he&rsquo;d turn and he&rsquo;d bump and he&rsquo;d grind. And then there was Jackie Wilson. He&rsquo;d just go on and on, just phenomenal, unlimited, great talent. It&rsquo;s very sad to see that these artists really are penniless. They created so much joy for the world, and the system, meaning the record companies, totally took advantage of them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And it&rsquo;s not like they always say, you know, &ldquo;They built a big house, they spent a lot of money, they bought a lot of cars.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s stupid. That&rsquo;s just an excuse. That&rsquo;s nothing compared to what artists make. I just need you to know that this is very important, what we&rsquo;re fighting for. Because I&rsquo;m tired&mdash;I&rsquo;m really, REALLY tired of the manipulation, I&rsquo;m tired of how the press is manipulating everything that&rsquo;s been happening in this situation. They do not tell the truth! They&rsquo;re liars!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And they manipulate our history books. The history books are not true! It&rsquo;s a lie! The history books are lying. You need to know that. You must know that. All the forms of popular music: From jazz to hip-hop, to bebop to soul. You talk about the different dances from the cake walk to the jitterbug to the Charleston to breakdancing. All these are forms of BLACK dancing!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What&rsquo;s more important than giving people a sense of escapism, and escapism meaning entertainment. What would we be like without a song? What would we be like without a dance, joy, and laughter, and music? These things are very important!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But if you go to the bookstore down at the corner, you won&rsquo;t see ONE BLACK PERSON on the cover! You&rsquo;ll see Elvis Presley. You&rsquo;ll see the Rolling Stones. But where are the real pioneers who started it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Otis Blackwell was a prolific, phenomenal writer. He wrote some of the greatest Elvis Presley songs. And this was a black man. He died penniless. And no one wrote about this man ever, they didn&rsquo;t write one book about him at all. His songs were heard all over the world. I met his daughter today, and I was so honored. To me, meeting her was on the same level as meeting the Queen of England.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;m here to speak for all injustice. You gotta remember something&mdash;the minute I started breaking the all-time record in record sales&mdash;I broke Elvis&rsquo;s records, I broke Beatles records&mdash;the minute it became the all-time best-selling album in the history of the Guinness Book of World Records, OVERNIGHT they called me a freak, they called me a homosexual, they called me a child molester, they said I bleached my skin! They made everything to turn the public against me!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And this is all a complete, complete conspiracy. You have to know that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I know my race! I just look in a mirror. I know I&rsquo;m black.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You know, it&rsquo;s time for a change! Let&rsquo;s not leave this building and forget what has been said. Put it into your heart. Put it into your subconscious mind, and let&rsquo;s do something about it. We have to. We have to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Because this has been a long, long time coming. And a change has got to come!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So let&rsquo;s hold our torches high, and get the respect that we deserve.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Sings] I love you!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PLEASE don&rsquo;t put this in your heart today and forget it tomorrow, or we will have not have accomplished our purpose if that happens. This has got to stop. It has got to stop. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here with the best, to make sure it stops.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I love you folks! And remember, we&rsquo;re all brothers and sisters, no matter what color we are.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Fox News&rdquo; interview, speech transcript</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Speech outtake] MJ: &quot;We must put an end to this racism... racism is bad.

Those..uh.. great artists who pioneered, you know, entertainment business as well as songwriting as well as incredible staging, you know. The fact that they have been taken by the system.

I mean beautifully, and he understands we need a mouthpiece. A voice for the voiceless, you know... and he&#39;s.. he&#39;s the guy.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">R: &quot;One other quick question... just because you&#39;re in New York... one of the frustrations of 9/11 was the charity album... just what are your thoughts about 9/11 when you&#39;re here in New York?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">M: &quot;I hated it. I&#39;d hate it if it was anywhere.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">MTV</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson took on Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola this past weekend, accusing the head of his record company of being a racist and part of a racist conspiracy against black artists.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though it was anticipated that Jackson would challenge standard practices of the music industry and champion artists&#39; rights when he spoke at the Rev. Al Sharpton&#39;s National Action Network in New York&#39;s Harlem neighborhood on Saturday, his personal attacks against the Sony executive came as a surprise, not least of all to Sharpton himself.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Most of Jackson&#39;s comments were constrained to the overall treatment of black artists, the struggle of whom he said he shared. The pop star compared his troubles with his record company to those of artists who struggled financially, saying that there was an &quot;incredible injustice&quot; taking place.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;They steal, they cheat, they do everything they can, especially [against] the black artists. ... People from James Brown to Sammy Davis Jr., some of the real pioneers that inspired me to be an entertainer, these artists are always on tour, because if they stop touring, they would go hungry. If you fight for me, you&#39;re fighting for all black people, dead and alive.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Jackson may have taken a wrong turn when he turned the fight for him into a fight against Mottola. Claiming that Mottola had used the &quot;N-word&quot; to refer to an unidentified black Sony artist, Jackson singled out the company chairman for being &quot;mean ... a racist ... and very, very, very devilish.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those accusations expanded on previous comments Jackson had made at a fan club event in London on June 15, where he told the crowd, &quot;Tommy Mottola is a devil.&quot; At that event, Jackson didn&#39;t address any aspects of racism, and he limited his remarks to his troubles with Sony, which he claimed had tried to destroy what was to have been his comeback album, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> by failing to promote it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to sources close to the album, Sony spent $30 million to make </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and $25 million to promote it; only two singles and one video were released, however. And while Jackson did perform two high-profile anniversary concerts in September that were later televised (see [article id=&quot;1448761&quot;]&quot;Michael Jackson Smooth At Tribute, But Wait Was Criminal&quot;[/article]), he did not tour to support the album &mdash; another source close to the project said that Jackson refused to. Jackson also made few public appearances and granted even fewer interviews. Though </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> sold an estimated 6 million copies worldwide and went double platinum in the U.S., it was not a blockbuster.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Still, the pop star has since escalated his troubles with his album sales and record company into an artist rights&#39; issue, one that garnered him the support of not only Sharpton but also Johnnie Cochran. While Sharpton still supports Jackson&#39;s view on the record industry overall, Sharpton told the </span><span class="cs43C038A">New York Post</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> that he was unaware that the pop star would vilify Mottola, an action he said was unfair and unfounded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was the first record executive to step up and offer to help us with respect to corporate accountability, when it comes to black music issues,&quot; Sharpton told the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Post.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &quot;I have known Tommy for 15 or 20 years, and never once have I known him to say or do anything that would be considered racist. ... I didn&#39;t know that Michael planned to personally attack Tommy, but nobody tells Michael Jackson what to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For its part, Sony was quick to defend Mottola as well, releasing a statement saying the company was bewildered by the pop star&#39;s remarks, which it called &quot;ludicrous, spiteful and hurtful.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We were deeply offended by the outrageous comments Mr. Jackson made during his publicity stunt this past Saturday,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;The executive he attacked is widely supported and respected in every part of the music industry and has championed both Mr. Jackson&#39;s career and the careers of many other superstars. In launching an unfounded and unwarranted attack on this man&#39;s reputation, Mr. Jackson has committed a serious abuse of the power that comes with celebrity. The bizarre, false statements Mr. Jackson made on Saturday make it clear that his difficulties lie elsewhere than with the marketing and promotion of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Invincible.</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As the lines get drawn, Sharpton told the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Post</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> that he&#39;s already received a flurry of calls from top-level artists and producers upset with Jackson and coming to Mottola&#39;s defense, including producers Steve Stoute and Corey Rooney (Jennifer Lopez, Destiny&#39;s Child, Marc Anthony). It will soon be apparent whether Sharpton can separate Jackson&#39;s remarks about Mottola from the broader industry concerns their alliance is supposed to address, such as artist contracts and royalties, when National Action Network&#39;s Music Industry Initiative summit takes place Tuesday at NAN&#39;s New York headquarters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/nyregion/record-industry-is-attacked-by-a-top-star.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; (July 6, 2002)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527203632/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/nyregion/record-industry-is-attacked-by-a-top-star.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson took a feud with his record company to the streets of Manhattan yesterday, charging the recording industry with racism and opportunism at the expense of minority performers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Jackson appeared with the Rev. Al Sharpton at that National Action Network in Harlem, and rode a double decker tour bus past the Sony building on Madison Avenue in a protest against his own recording company, Sony Music, and its chairman, Thomas D. Mottola.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;&#39;The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists -- they steal, they cheat, they do everything they can,&#39;&#39; he told an audience at the National Action Network, headed by the Rev. Sharpton.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Jackson told the group that Mr. Mottola was &#39;&#39;mean, he&#39;s racist, and he&#39;s very, very, very devilish.&#39;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr. Jackson&#39;s relations with Sony have frayed since the release of his most recent album, &#39;&#39;Invincible,&#39;&#39; which has had disappointing sales. Fans of the singer have criticized Sony Music for failing to do enough to promote the album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But some in the music industry say weak sales of &#39;&#39;Invincible&#39;&#39; reflect the flagging appeal of Mr. Jackson, 43, who has been one of the most successful pop singers since he was a child.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a statement yesterday, Sony Music said it was &#39;&#39;appalled that Mr. Jackson would stoop so low in his constant quest for publicity,&#39;&#39; according to The Associated Press.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The statement called the singer&#39;s charge of racism &#39;&#39;ludicrous, spiteful and hurtful,&#39;&#39; and said the criticism of Mr. Mottola was &#39;&#39;particularly bizarre&#39;&#39; since Mr. Mottola has championed Mr. Jackson&#39;s career for many years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&quot;30 Years of Magic Fan Celebration&quot;:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE"><a class="cs104BA6B9" href="http://www.michaeljackson.ch/awardfan.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;3Generations&rdquo; Michael Jackson Fan Club (2002)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191231155539/http://www.michaeljackson.ch/awardfan.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The MJ 30th Anniversary Award is an award for Michael from YOU - the fans - celebrating him being on stage for 30 years!
