		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Statement After Processing in Santa Barbara</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The big lie against Michael Jackson is anchored in the most vicious allegation imaginable, one that resonates across every culture: the spectacle of harming a child. That spectacle invites outrage, and it should. But this spectacle is rooted in a lie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">			</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael said, &quot;Lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons. The truth will win this marathon in court.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">			</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is going to defend himself with the force of his spirit, as would anyone falsely accused of something so monstrous.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Charles Thomson, freelance writer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two days after the Neverland raid Jackson&rsquo;s depression turned to anger. When it emerged that the boy behind the accusation was none other than Gavin Arvizo, the boy whose hand Jackson had held in the Martin Bashir documentary, Jackson decided to fight.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You know, when it was clear that this allegation was because of the Arvizos, then he started to really fight the situation,&rdquo; says Wiesner. &ldquo;Michael told me, &lsquo;Dieter, you know what, they should bring this young boy into a big place, invite all the press and he should look me in the eyes and tell me that I did this.&rsquo; So he was ready to fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That the allegation had come from the Arvizos made the ruination of the MJ Universe project even more galling for Stuart Backerman.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Sneddon didn&rsquo;t have anything except the word of Janet Arvizo, and she was totally crazy,&rdquo; says Backerman. &ldquo;And I know that because I was there and I saw her. She had a track record as long as my right arm. Sneddon just wanted to get Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very frustrating to this day. We had the world&rsquo;s greatest celebrity and he was more focused than he had been for a long time. But the whole thing got cut off by Sneddon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Almost unbelievably, Sneddon had managed for the second time to steal Jackson&rsquo;s movie dream away from him just as he was on the cusp of achieving it. Prior to the 1993 allegations, moving into the movie industry had been Jackson&rsquo;s greatest preoccupation. His chances ruined by the scandal of the Jordy Chandler debacle, he&rsquo;d wound up back on the road &ndash; the one place he&rsquo;d least wanted to be &ndash; and grown ever more weary of the music business.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Movie success was the one type of success which had always managed to evade Jackson &ndash; the most decorated entertainer in history &ndash; and it had long been the one type of success he truly longed for. Believing that </span><span class="cs43C038A">One More Chance</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> would fulfill his contract with </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sony</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Jackson had felt he was finally free to pursue his vision.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I really have to say, he was a very sharp guy. He knew exactly what he wanted,&rdquo; laments Dieter Wiesner. &ldquo;I think if he would have had the time and if nobody had come in-between, he could have been very successful in the second part in this career, with the movies and the animated videos. In my opinion, he would still be here today.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With movie success set firmly in his sights, Jackson was merely jumping through the necessary hoops before he could pursue that goal with one hundred percent of his attention and energy. </span><span class="cs43C038A">One More Chance</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, he had thought, was the final hoop. Michael Jackson had believed that the single and music video would win him back his freedom. It is one of life&rsquo;s cruel ironies that the next time his fans saw him, he would be in handcuffs.</span></p></body>
