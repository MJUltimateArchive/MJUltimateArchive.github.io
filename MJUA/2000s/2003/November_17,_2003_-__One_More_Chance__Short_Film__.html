A new greatest hits compilation, </span><span class="cs43C038A">Number Ones,</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> was due to be released on November 18th and, thinking it would fulfill his contractual obligations to </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sony</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Jackson had contributed an unreleased track, </span><span class="cs43C038A">One More Chance</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, and agreed to promote it as a single.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Seeing the opportunity to fulfill another contractual obligation at the same time &ndash; he owed </span><span class="cs43C038A">CBS </span><span class="csD5D7D290">a performance - Jackson decided to record an accompanying music video. The video would debut on November 26th at the end of a </span><span class="cs43C038A">CBS</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> special about the star and then go into rotation elsewhere...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nick Brandt, a seasoned Jackson collaborator, was scheduled to direct the new video. Brandt had worked on numerous short films with the star in the past - most famously on the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Earth Song</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> video, which combined Jackson&rsquo;s strong environmental views with the director&rsquo;s acclaimed wildlife photography. Their most recent outing had been 2001&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Cry</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, a video Jackson reportedly refused to appear in due to his conflict with </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sony</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The shoot would take place at the </span><span class="cs43C038A">CMX Productions</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> studio and the concept was simple. The song was a yearning ballad about lost love in which Jackson pleaded with an ex-girlfriend for &lsquo;one more chance at love&rsquo;. The video would feature a unique role reversal in which an audience would stand onstage and watch Jackson as he performed the track in an empty, upscale nightclub, hopping banisters and jumping on tables. The set-up seemed to have little correlation with the song and appeared to be more of a comment on the press and public&rsquo;s perpetual invasion into Jackson&rsquo;s privacy &ndash; a common theme in the star&rsquo;s videos &ndash; essentially showing a crowd of bystanders watching over Jackson in an intimate, off-stage moment, transfixed by his heartbreak.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson technically owed </span><span class="cs43C038A">CBS</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> a performance so the aim was to create a hybrid that would satisfy the broadcaster and also work as a music video. An idea was hatched to give the video a live feeling by following Jackson seamlessly through the club rather than cutting from scene to scene in the typical music video style.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We had five cameras rolling on him at all times,&rdquo; says a senior crew member, who asked to remain anonymous after speaking without record label permission. &ldquo;The idea was to try to capture Michael, as much as possible, doing one routine through the club, to give it kind of a live feeling. It would literally flow from one camera to the next. We also had kind of a limited time with Michael because he would set his own schedule, so we also decided to capture it that way to make sure we could get it all shot cohesively.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Running the production on a tight schedule and a tight budget, the crew got one rehearsal day with Jackson. &ldquo;Michael came in that day to do dance rehearsals with Nick and to work out how he would move around the club,&rdquo; says the crew member. &ldquo;That was where we determined which tables he would jump on so we could light them properly and so on. So that was probably about two to three hours of just Nick and other key crew members working with Michael &ndash; maybe four hours.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Watching his process with Nick was quite inspiring. He really liked to create with Nick. He was involved in everything. He was obviously an experienced artist in music videos and knew what the process was all about, knew who the key people were to talk to. I mean, he and the crew had a definite conversation about composition and lighting and how to capture various dance moves with the camera and what angles to use. He was truly an artist. He didn&rsquo;t just show up and not care. He was definitely excited to be there and involved in the process and really wanted to create something special.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s manager Dieter Wiesner, however, says the singer wasn&rsquo;t quite as excited as he seemed; much of the video had been devised in the star&rsquo;s absence and he was annoyed by the modest budget.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael was not too happy about it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was a relaxed situation but it was not what Michael really wanted to do. He looked still for the biggest thing and this was not something he would pick. It was not one of his high class things he did before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wiesner says Jackson was also unhappy with the set&rsquo;s resemblance to one of his best known videos from the 1980s. &ldquo;When we arrived there, the set was already done. He was saying, &lsquo;This is like </span><span class="cs43C038A">Smooth Criminal</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&rsquo;. But he did his job. I think when he started to do something, he did it right. He was not so happy but he had to deliver something and that&rsquo;s what he did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Monday 17th November 2003 a crowd of extras waited in a holding area at the </span><span class="cs43C038A">CMX</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> studio. They knew they were there for a music video, but that was all they knew. &ldquo;We auditioned on the Friday and knew we were going to shoot at the soundstage on Monday,&rdquo; says Ken Yesh, one of the extras chosen for the shoot. &ldquo;We went the entire weekend wondering who the video was for. &nbsp;Then, when we got there, we signed some papers and on the back page it said &lsquo;</span><span class="cs43C038A">Michael Jackson, One More Chance, Sony Productions&rsquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. We all just flipped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;That right there was such a moment,&rdquo; says fellow extra Juliette Myers. &ldquo;As we were going down the line we were cheering because wow, you know, what an iconic moment. We were going to be a part of something that&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the excitement was short-lived. &ldquo;When we went into the soundstage they told us that &lsquo;yes, this is a Michael Jackson video but he will not be here&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Ken Yesh. &ldquo;So we were all pretty disappointed. He had a body double that was doing all the camera sets and all the arrangements. We thought that that was all that was going to be there &ndash; just a lookalike.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The extras were put in bleachers on the stage in a choral arrangement while the crew tinkered with the lighting. A few extras were selected to look into the distance or look amazed and the crew panned the audience a lot, but the extras spent much of their time standing around. &ldquo;If they weren&rsquo;t going to use us for a scene then they&rsquo;d take us back out to the waiting area,&rdquo; says extra Stephen McClelland. &ldquo;I remember us waiting outside while they were trying to set up some of the table things to get a rough idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Being extras, we started early but we didn&rsquo;t really have to do much,&rdquo; agrees Juliette Myers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d set us up, they&rsquo;d do some lighting and cue the music and we&rsquo;d stand and do our part, then we&rsquo;d cut for a break. There was never really much work. There was a very free, fun and fancy type air about the day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several hours into the shooting day, Michael Jackson, wearing dark jeans and a white t-shirt, slipped onto the set through a back door. &ldquo;When he made his entrance it wasn&rsquo;t anything grand,&rdquo; says Ken Yesh. &ldquo;It was kind of on the down low - really hush-hush. We were onstage at the time so there were a few whispers of, &lsquo;Oh my God, I think that&rsquo;s him!&rsquo; The room was pretty dim. The whole ambience was the nightclub scene so there were some lamps on the tables and the stage lights were very dim, but he&rsquo;s pretty hard to miss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was like electricity through the air,&rdquo; adds Stephen McClelland. &ldquo;Everybody was getting really excited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t even prepared for him to come out,&rdquo; says Juliette Myers. &ldquo;We were standing in the bleachers and I was talking to somebody and all of a sudden I heard cheering. I looked up and he was just there. It&rsquo;s weird how you don&rsquo;t even realize how powerful he is until he&rsquo;s there. It&rsquo;s like a presence. I couldn&rsquo;t stop screaming. I tried to be professional but that didn&rsquo;t work. We were all screaming our heads off. But he let us have our time. I&rsquo;m sure he knew that he was going to have fans so he gave us time to just embrace him and then we got to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The crew had spent much of the day preparing for Jackson&rsquo;s arrival in order to avoid keeping him waiting once he arrived. With everything in position and ready to go, Jackson launched into his first performance almost immediately, meandering around the nightclub and showcasing his famous dance moves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I think they told us he wasn&rsquo;t going to be there because they wanted to see our responses on film when he started dancing,&rdquo; says Ken Yesh, &ldquo;because when he first came in, it wasn&rsquo;t five minutes and he jumped right into it. He started going into the sequences, walking through the tables at the nightclub, going up to the stage, singing, jumping onto the tables and onto the chairs &ndash; and I was looking at everyone else and their faces were like mine. It was just disbelief.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was amazing,&rdquo; recalls Juliette Myers. &ldquo;Part of our reaction was supposed to be shock and awe, but it was real. We were just like &lsquo;Oh my gosh, he&rsquo;s here. This is him in real life. He&rsquo;s right in front of us&rsquo;. It was so easy to be happy and to have the wondrous looks in our eyes. He did a move standing on a table right in front of us and it was like, &lsquo;Wow. There it is. This is what we grew up with&rsquo;. It made that reaction and that moment real.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;They had genuine surprise on everyone&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; says Ken Yesh. &ldquo;Everyone had a permanent smile across their face. They couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I think we all understood what it meant. &nbsp;We were in the presence of one of the best entertainers ever on the face of the earth. I mean, who has the chance to do something like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was like seeing Elvis perform live, or the Beatles,&rdquo; agrees Steve McClelland. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a legend in front of you performing. It was magical. All those rumors about him being past it were, I believe after seeing him, completely unfounded. He was still perfectly capable. He was truly magic. Truly blessed.&ldquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Each time Jackson finished the routine, shooting would pause while the crew fixed the set for continuity; in each performance Jackson would kick lamps and wine glasses off of the nightclub tables. Between takes Jackson would interact occasionally with the extras, says Stephen McClelland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We&rsquo;d all been standing there for a long time. He&rsquo;d say thing like, &lsquo;I hope you guys aren&rsquo;t too uncomfortable back there&rsquo; because the lights would come up on us and we were standing really tight together and we couldn&rsquo;t move. Between takes we had to stay there. &nbsp;So he was just feeling for us a little bit. When he started to perform he was very focused but then he would go back to being just casual. He&rsquo;d say things to us like, &lsquo;I hope you all liked that one&rsquo;. He was being funny, witty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mostly, though, Jackson kept to himself. &ldquo;He was kind of separate,&rdquo; says Juliette Myers. &ldquo;I think he was just really shy. I remember there was direction that he was very shy so they didn&rsquo;t want us to look directly in his face.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was extremely surprised at how humble he was,&rdquo; adds Ken Yesh. &ldquo;But when the camera started rolling and the music was on, it was like electricity. The guy was completely amazing. He would do the same dance sequence five or six times, flawlessly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael was soft spoken and kept to himself,&rdquo; confirms a crew member. &ldquo;But when the cameras started rolling he just became Michael Jackson instantaneously. The moves and the walking and everything, it was just Michael Jackson through and through. It was amazing. I remember him jumping up on a table and doing a spin at one point and his hands went up in the air and it was just 100% pure Michael Jackson. I&rsquo;ll never forget that memory.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After performing the routine five or six times across roughly three hours, Michael Jackson made his exit. &ldquo;He was really sweet with all the extras,&rdquo; says a crew member. &ldquo;When he was leaving he said a great big goodbye to them and thanked them for all their hard work. He was such a gentleman.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t just scurry out,&rdquo; says Juliette Myers. &ldquo;He respectfully said thank you. I don&rsquo;t even know what he was thanking us for, though.&rdquo; She laughs. &ldquo;He was the star. We were just backdrop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was scheduled to return the following day to film frontal shots and close-ups. &ldquo;Our intention was to shoot from behind Michael towards the audience and then, to save money on all the audience members, the following day we would flip around and shoot Michael&rsquo;s close-ups,&rdquo; says a crew member. &ldquo;So pretty much everything we got on the first day was head to toe and shot either in profile or from behind, with the audience in the background.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The day&rsquo;s rushes showed Jackson on good form, leaping energetically from table to table, running around the club and looking genuinely happy as he high-fived the crowd. He paid subtle homage to older videos; a shot in which he pulled his jacket down over his shoulders before the excited audience was reminiscent of the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dirty Diana</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> music video while his kicking the table decorations as he danced called to mind his controversial short film for </span><span class="cs43C038A">Black or White</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the end of each take Jackson had nodded and bowed to the audience, turned his back on the stage &ndash; an enormous grin on his face &ndash; and walked out of frame. This shot would serve as the end of the music video and the moment was loaded with connotations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson turning his back on the stage - and on his audience - was symbolic of his intention to leave the music world behind and embark on a brand new career path. Perhaps smiling with as much relief as happiness, he was also turning his back on his final music video for </span><span class="cs43C038A">Sony</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and, he thought, walking away from the contract that he so desperately wanted out of. In essence, he was turning his back on his old career and walking away from it, ready to follow the dream that had been snatched from him ten years previously. Michael Jackson was finally going to make movies.</span></p></body>
