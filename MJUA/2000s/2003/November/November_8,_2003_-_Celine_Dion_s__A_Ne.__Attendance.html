We spent about an hour together, and he had a lot of questions for me. He was very -- to me, he seemed to be like, &quot;I want to know so much. I want to know how it is to be in Las Vegas, how it is to sing every night here. Is it difficult? Is it difficult to sing here every night? Is it demanding?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I felt that he wanted to know so much. And me, I wanted to know so much. I wanted to know so much from him.

And the whole coliseum, the whole crowd went crazy, because Michael Jackson was not only an extremely talented person, he was unique. And he was a genius. And when I said, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Jackson is with us tonight,&quot; the people -- I thought people were going to jump off the balcony. The people went crazy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
