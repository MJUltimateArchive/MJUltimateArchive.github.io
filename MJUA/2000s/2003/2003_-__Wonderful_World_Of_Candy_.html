Michael Jackson has been working throughout 2003 on a brand-new studio album (initially intended for release sometime in 2004). At that time (2003), Dieter Wiesner was Michael Jackson&#39;s manager and he introduced young music artist Nisha Kataria, his newest prot&eacute;g&eacute;, to Michael. Michael Jackson invited Nisha onto his Neverland Valley Ranch to record with her some tracks in his private recording studio (contrary to claims by some individuals, Michael Jackson had such a place at his home). She stayed there for about six weeks and Michael wrote this song and they both recorded it as a duet. After Michael&#39;s dramatic moral conduct in November 2003, all plans have been put on hiatus since. At the present moment (June 2009) it is still unknown if and when the track will be used. It could possibly be included on Nisha Kataria&#39;s forthcoming debut album, set for release THIS YEAR (2009).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Nisha Kataria, singer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.myspace.com/nishakataria"><span class="cs8567212B">Myspace page</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://mjhideout.com/forum/showpost.php?p=1367791&amp;postcount=3"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My big break came when I was discovered by MICHAEL JACKSON!............After hearing my voice, he invited me to stay in Neverland! I performed at his 45th birthday bash and recorded a song together with him, which he has never done with an unestablished singer before.....</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was supposed to make my debut with him, but due to his personal problems, I was unable to, but it was amazing to get my big start with the King of Pop ....</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/v20llybrxQU"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Insider&rdquo; TV show interview (August 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first time I met him, I was very, very nervous because I didn&#39;t know what to expect, but Dieter brought me into Michael&#39;s private library and he told me to sit down and wait while he got Michael. So, I remember sitting down just very, very nervous and a few moments later, I heard footsteps on the floor, and I look over and Michael comes in, and he has a big smile on his face, and Paris and Prince follow him, and Grace and Dieter come in. And Michael came up to me, and gave me a big hug and introduced himself, and I did the same. And then Prince and Paris put their hands out to shake my hand, and Michael said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t shake hands in his family. We give hugs&quot;. So, then the kids gave me a hug and it was so sweet, and we all sat down and began talking. That day, he was just like, &quot;Okay, well, I want you and your family to go enjoy Neverland, and we&#39;ll see you soon.&quot; So, I remember--right when we left the room, that&#39;s when my heart started racing and I was like, &quot;Oh my gosh! Mom! Dad! I just met Michael Jackson!&quot; We went around the ranch and we went on rides, and Dieter came with me and my family, and he kind of showed us where to go and we all drove little ATVs, and we went on the swings. And I just remembered going on the swings with my brother and sister, and you can request music, so we always requested &quot;Thriller&quot; and we were listening to it while swinging. It was a fairy tale, because we did things there that we would never do anywhere else. I don&#39;t know of any other home that has--when you wake up in the morning and you look outside your window, we would look at the lake and two elephants were being bathed in the lake. So, I mean, it was just a fairy tale. Michael actually invited me and my mom to live with him in Neverland, where we stayed for a couple months, and I recorded with Michael. It was just surreal, because I remember they were just preparing the room for us, and I remember his nephews Eli and Lee. They were also very helpful, and they showed us to our room, and it was just a beautiful, big room, and it was just crazy moving in. It was a magical experience, because this man--he is incredibly talented, and he&#39;s the man behind &quot;Thriller&quot; and all these amazing songs, but actually seeing him at work, coming up with these melodies. He would pace the room, like walk around, and he would come up with these melodies, and he would say, &quot;Okay, I need you to sing this&quot; and he would sing it, and then I would sing it into the microphone. And he would come up with these harmonies, it was just so beautiful. I was just really--I do well under pressure, because I was able to do everything he wanted. He was able to say, &quot;Okay Nisha, sing this line&quot;, and then we would do it in one take, and it was done. So working with him was excellent, because he had these visions, and it would come out through me, and so it was just a really great experience doing that with him. It was an absolute dream. I mean, on the days that we weren&#39;t recording, we were going horseback riding, watching movies, in the theater playing games all day long, it was just a lot of fun. The next plan was to go on tour. We went to the Radio Music Awards, and five days later we were supposed to fly to Germany where he was to present the Bambi award, and then we were going to go to South Africa to visit Mandela, and Brazil, and we were going to shoot the &quot;One More Chance&quot; video, and the plan was that he would introduce me to the world. I would go on stage for the first time next to Michael Jackson. After the Radio Music Awards, just days later, the police raided the ranch, and so, he had to deal with the trial for the next two years. I thought that everything would be over and that was a great chapter in my life, and I was really sad. And at the same time, his manager said &quot;You&#39;re good, and I don&#39;t want to see this end&quot;. So he took me to Germany where I pursued my career, and the plan was that we would always--once Michael was ready again, we would get back together with him... Me and my mom and him and his family, we all lived there and it was all a great time. And I think that after the police raided the ranch, it was just too hard for him to go back, so he never went back either. It&#39;s just an honor to have been the last girl to record with Michael, to have been the last girl to have been invited into his home, and it&#39;s just a huge honor that he opened up his heart and home to me. He was feeling good again, and my manager had been contacting all the organizers for the show, and I was going to be an opening act for at least two or three of the shows, so I was really looking forward to seeing him again... Michael Jackson was the best artist that the world has ever seen, and I think that every artist will continue to look up to him, because we&#39;re all inspired by him. He was the best, and not only that, he was a really amazing down-to-earth human being, and I think everybody can learn something from him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
