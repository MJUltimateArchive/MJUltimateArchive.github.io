Everybody is so incredibly jazzed. Now I have seen your wonderful, beautiful ranch. But most people just fantasize about what it would be like to just walk the grounds...and now we&#39;re going to get a chance. Now will you be there?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Uh...yes, I will be there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Alright!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Girl in background: That&#39;s what we wanted to hear.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yep, I will be there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Commander Chuck Street said that he really enjoyed taking you up in the helicopter.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Aww, that guy is so nice.

Thank you. Well, you know you&#39;re always welcome. You know that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: What a nice thing to say Michael. And you know Saturday is very special too because I don&#39;t think that people understand that there are different ways to raise money for great causes, but for you to open your home for Make A Wish and other foundations is really special to us.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Aw, God Bless you. Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Can you catch us up to speed, now, over the last few months.

And when I saw the shot of you...I think it was about 2 or 3 weeks ago...you&#39;re still in really good shape. Is it still just dance that keeps you in shape?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I just like to dance around to music that I like.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: M-hm.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ellen Kaye: And chasing two kids, that&#39;ll keep you in shape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yes, running after the children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ellen Kaye: I have 2 toddlers myself and once they get those tennis shoes on, there&#39;s no slowing down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: I know...but it&#39;s mainly just I enjoy dancing... I just walk around the lake at Neverland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: And I&#39;d like to point out ...the lake at Neverland, is absolutely, it&#39;s right in the very front, at least one of them...and you just wanna dive in. It really is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Now Prince and Paris, how are they different? What are their likes and dislikes? What can you tell, as a parent, you know, &#39;Prince likes this, and Paris likes this&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Well they like, in truth, they like the same things. Prince, he doesn&#39;t like girl toys. I always wanted a daughter, and through all the years I&#39;ve toured, I bought all these dolls, and I filled the whole room up full of dolls for when I have a daughter...and that would be her bedroom. And the first time I brought her in there, when she was old enough to walk, she just walked right passed it. (laughs)...she likes boy toys. She likes trucks, cars...whatever prince wants, she wants.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: You&#39;re kidding! And there&#39;s a whole room of dolls and she just walks right through them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah...(laughs)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: The first time I met Michael, Ellen, it was um, not in a, well first of all we we saw each other on a tv show, but the first time we got a chance to socialize it was at a place called &quot;Robbies&#39; Hobbies&quot; and we both got into little, uh, they&#39;re radio controlled cars...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ellen Kaye: I like those too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yeah...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: And they were so much fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: You have a great memory.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Well, thank you. So I had a jeep made up for Michael. And he would take it on tour. And he would hide behind like a curtain or something, and this car would just show up at someone&#39;s feet. And it would stop, and they would jump around, and he&#39;d bring the car back to him. They never knew it was Mike behind the controls! (laughs)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: (laughs)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Great.

I&#39;ll be kinda watching from a distance and enjoying it. I hope I can get to say hi to you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: Oh, absolutely. When you go back to your bedroom, like really late?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael: Yes</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Rick: I&#39;ll be in the closet.
