Michael would never harm a child in any way. These scurrilous and totally unfounded allegations will be proven false in a courtroom. Naturally, the implications are distressing to everyone who hears them, which is precisely the point.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">			</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We are disturbed by the levity of the environment surrounding the announcement of these very serious charges. When the evidence is presented and the allegations proven to be malicious and wholly unfounded, Michael will be able to put this nightmare behind him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">			</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael through his attorneys, led by Mark Geragos, has already made arrangements with the District Attorney to return to Santa Barbara to immediately confront and prove these charges unfounded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Charles Thomson, freelance writer</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson spent much of those two days crying, says Dieter Wiesner. &ldquo;I was sitting with him day and night. He was shocked; he was crying&hellip; he didn&rsquo;t know what to do. It was such a bad situation. We were supposed to go to Europe. He was ready to move on in his life and everything was prepared. It was just a beautiful situation and this news shocked him deeply. Really, it killed him.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
