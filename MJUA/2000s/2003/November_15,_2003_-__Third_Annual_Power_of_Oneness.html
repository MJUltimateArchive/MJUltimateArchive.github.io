Sorry, I have the hiccups. [Smiles] I have to be honest. I would like to thank, personally, K. C. Porter and the staff members of Oneness, whose work on &ldquo;What More Can I Give&rdquo; and the Spanish version &ldquo;Todo Para Ti&rdquo; has been invaluable. &ldquo;I love you&hellip; and thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. And I&rsquo;m sorry about the hiccups. Thank you so much. I love you.</span></p></body>
