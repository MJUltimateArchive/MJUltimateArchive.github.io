Although &lsquo;The Footage You Were Never Meant To See&rsquo; was provided by Michael and Hamid Moslehi, they did not have editorial rights on it. Contrary to opinion and what was reported, Bashir was fully aware that Michael had his own cameraman filming at the same time. What Michael&rsquo;s footage showed was how Bashir twisted and betrayed Michael with his version. In &ldquo;The Footage You Were Never Meant To See&rdquo;, you hear Bashir constantly praising Michael. Making appearances are Debbie Rowe, Jermaine Jackson, Karen Faye, Hamid Moslehi and Michael&rsquo;s mother and father. Debbie Rowe confirmed she received no payment for her interview.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2786385.stm"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;BBC News&rdquo; (February 21, 2003)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090105120811/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2786385.stm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Journalist Martin Bashir has been seen lavishing praise on Michael Jackson in a two-hour show - the star&#39;s response to a documentary on his life - shown in the US on Thursday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The footage was shot by the pop star&#39;s own cameraman during the filming of Living With Michael Jackson, broadcast on ITV1 in the UK.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was presented in a show entitled Michael Jackson, Take Two: The Interview They Wouldn&#39;t Show You, on the US television network, Fox.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">British viewers will be able to watch the documentary on Monday, 24 February, after it was bought by Sky One.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson sold the footage to Fox for &pound;1.6m because he felt he had been misrepresented in Bashir&#39;s original programme.</span></p></body>
