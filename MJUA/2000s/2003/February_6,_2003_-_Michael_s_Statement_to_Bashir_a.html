Michael Jackson has never, and would never, treat a child inappropriately or expose them to any harm and totally refutes any suggestions to the contrary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael would never betray the trust that a child, or their parents, might place in him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was today moved to make the following personal statement:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs2DE14E7C">____________________________</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I trusted Martin Bashir to come into my life and that of my family because I wanted the truth to be told.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Martin Bashir persuaded me to trust him that his would be an honest and fair portrayal of my life and told me that he was &lsquo;the man that turned Diana&#39;s life around&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I am surprised that a professional journalist would compromise his integrity by deceiving me in this way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Today I feel more betrayed than perhaps ever before; that someone, who had got to know my children, my staff and me, whom I let into my heart and told the truth, could then sacrifice the trust I placed in him and produce this terrible and unfair programme.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Everyone who knows me will know the truth which is that my children come first in my life and that I would never harm any child.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I also want to thank my fans around the world for the overwhelming number of messages of support that I have received, particularly from Great Britain, where people have e-mailed me and said how appalled they were by the Bashir film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Their love and support has touched me greatly.&quot; These comments are excerpts from a videotaped statement from Michael Jackson, which shall be released after the airing of the Bashir television special in the United States.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Debbie Rowe, Michael&#39;s ex-wife and the mother of two of his children reacted: &quot;It breaks my heart that anyone could truly believe that Michael would do anything to harm or endanger our children: they are the most important thing in his life.&quot;</span></p></body>
