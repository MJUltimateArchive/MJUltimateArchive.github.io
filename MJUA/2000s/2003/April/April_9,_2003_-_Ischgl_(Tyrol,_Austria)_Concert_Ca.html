Well, with Wednesday, the 9th of April at 17.00 - and not as mistakenly communicated on Monday, April 7, it is clear:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wednesday, 17.00 clock was canceled. In a personal conversation between Michael Jackson and Recardo Patrick (co-organizer of Message from the Mountains), Jackson stated that he would not come to Ischgl for security reasons. The current global political situation makes it not easy for him to appear as an American citizen in public. He announced in the conversation a later Ischgl appearance at an unspecified date.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The organizer of the event, G&uuml;nther Aloys, had until recently tried to win Jackson over his management in Frankfurt for the performance. Earlier this week, in an ORF interview, he said, &quot;Michael Jackson is never 100% sure until the last moment, but we believe everything is over.&quot; That was not the case.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The cards are withdrawn!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Message from the Mountains - It will continue That with the surprising cancellation of Michael Jackson&#39;s last-minute event this year&#39;s event is about to end, G&uuml;nther Aloys - a man with the courage to be extraordinary and the strength to implement it - is an incentive for the future and challenge at the same time. He does not give up because he believes in youth and always creates new ideas for a peaceful future and a more dynamic economy in the Alps.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With Message from the Mountains, the first event for young people started in Ischgl in April 2002 against the extraordinary backdrop of Id-Alpe. First guest speaker was Bill Clinton. At the 2,200-meter-high Id-Alpe, internationally renowned personalities are expected to give a lecture on the future of Europe&#39;s youth and economy, thus generating positive, optimistic impulses. With a signal from above, Ischgl, a trendy meeting place for active youth and the alpine center of adventure tourism, wants to establish itself as a symbol of a young European identity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.n-tv.de/archiv/Michael-Jackson-in-Ischgl-article112604.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;n-tv&rdquo; (March 16, 2003)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (translated from German)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;King of Pop&quot; Michael Jackson comes to Austria. As part of the &quot;Message from the Mountain&quot; series, he will make a speech and give a concert on April 13 on the high alpine platform in Ischgl. This is what Samnaun Tourism announced.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He will also advertise his charity project &quot;Children help children&quot;. 30,000 spectators should experience Jackson on an open-air stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The event series &quot;Message from the Mountain&quot; received special media attention last year because former US President Bill Clinton lectured on the mountain. The speakers each receive a very high fee for their appearance in Ischgl.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.deseret.com/2003/4/10/19714811/michael-jackson-cancels-show-due-to-security"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Deseret News&rdquo; (April 10, 2003)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has canceled plans to appear in Austria next weekend because of concerns about security, an organizer of the event said Wednesday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 44-year-old pop singer has been scheduled to give a concert and introduce a charity project for children on Sunday in the western Austrian ski resort of Ischgl.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A spokesman for the event said Jackson was canceling the show because of security risks related to world political events.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1471179/michael-jacksons-private-home-movies-to-air-on-fox/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MTV News&rdquo; (April 10, 2003)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Michael Jackson] canceled plans to appear in Austria on Sunday because of security concerns at a time of war, according to an organizer of the event.
