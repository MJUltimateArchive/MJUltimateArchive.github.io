Well I thought it was time to do so because many people have opinions of me and they haven&rsquo;t even met me; they don&rsquo;t even know me. So I thought it was time to open up, to show them who I really am. I&rsquo;m just simply Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael&rsquo;s first Christmas:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met a lot of people in my life and very few are real, real, real friends. You can probably count them on one hand. Elizabeth is one of the most loyal loving caring people that I know. She decided to transform Neverland into its first Christmas and I don&rsquo;t celebrate Christmas. I had no idea she was planning this. This was a real surprise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Playing super soakers with Macaulay Culkin and sister Janet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&rdquo;If you&rsquo;re wondering why I love super soakers so much. If you come to Neverland it&rsquo;s a rule that you are bound to get wet. Whether you&rsquo;re thrown in the pool or have a water balloon fight, or a super soaker fight. And I love all of the above. That&rsquo;s Janet. We think so much alike. Here comes Macaulay Culkin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Every time I do an album I write almost nearly 100 or over a 100 songs so we have to skittle them down and Smooth Criminal almost didn&rsquo;t make it on the album and on top of that it was on the album I decided that I would make it a western. I went on the ranch on the property and I had a camera man pretty much shoot me coming up with ideas of how I wanted this thing to be and I wanted hats and the wind and just a lot of things you know some quick cut big shot some long shots and at the last minute I said nah I don&rsquo;t want it as a western it should be like hot summer night in Chicago 1945 and underground kinda thing going on. I think that was the best way to go. It&#39;s one of my favourite pieces. I get more comments on Smooth Criminal than any of the other pieces I&#39;ve ever done really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael chuckles at footage of Gregory and Veronica Peck going on the Zipper at his amusement park in Neverland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;See Gregory dancing? That&#39;s the child that comes out inside the men who come to Neverland. He&#39;s one of the nicest people in the world. I really love Gregory Peck and his wife. That there&rsquo;s dog Blanket believe it or not and Blanket&#39;s sister is Elizabeth Taylor&#39;s dog. Gregory Peck is a dear, dear friend of ours. He&#39;s singing, he&#39;s happy. Now he would never go on the Zipper. I hold the world record on that ride. I went on that for 35 minutes straight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gregory Peck can be heard to say:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Never again. I loved it but I hated it. Thanks. Can we do it every weekend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1471179/michael-jacksons-private-home-movies-to-air-on-fox/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MTV News&rdquo; (April 10, 2003)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170924045125/http://www.mtv.com/news/1471179/michael-jacksons-private-home-movies-to-air-on-fox/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;King of Pop&quot; or king of primetime television?
