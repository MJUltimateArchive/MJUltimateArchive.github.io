But Michael was looking at me and seemed cold. He just said, &lsquo;Hi&rsquo; and then he saw my daughter Yasmine and was fascinated with her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson said &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; to the youngster but had to be corrected when he mispronounced her name with a J.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JohVonnie went on: &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;OK, Yasmine with a Y&rsquo;, and that was it. He never acknowledged that I was his sister, there was no hug or kiss, not even a handshake. No physical contact at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I wanted to embrace him. I thought he would want to go some place quiet and sit and talk with me and ask me about my life and get to know me a little better.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was very hurtful. He was not interested at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The King of Pop&rsquo;s aloofness to her was in stark contrast to the warmth he showed his young niece.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She added: &ldquo;With my daughter he was totally different. She got hugs and kisses, everything I didn&rsquo;t get. I was a little jealous. But there was a bunch of people there and I never did get a chance to speak to Michael properly. Again, there was this theme that I felt shut out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JohVonnie spent the night at a nearby hotel rather than on the sprawling 2,700-acre California ranch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When she returned to Neverland the next day, Yasmine was again made to feel at home, while her mother never got to see Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">She said: &ldquo;Michael was in the main house. Yasmine and Paris were off playing for hours. Paris is such a sweet girl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">JohVonnie instead chatted to brother Jermaine and sister Rebbie but added sadly: &ldquo;None of my other siblings acknowledged me much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...She was born in 1974 during a 25-year affair between Jackson family patriarch Joe and mum Cheryle Terrell.</span></p></body>
