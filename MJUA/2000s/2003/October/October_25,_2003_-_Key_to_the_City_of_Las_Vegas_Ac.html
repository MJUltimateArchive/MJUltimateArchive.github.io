As they discussed their plan of action for the event, at least 200 fans were gathering outside the store. Inside the Art of Music Store, E&acute;Cassanova, famous Michael Jackson impersonator, and Michael&acute;s personal representative, Stuart Backerman, discussed and prepped key people regarding the presentation. Stuart Backerman reports to us that there are few celebrities that have been presented with The Key to Las Vegas and now Michael is one of the select few.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Half an hour later the crowd had grown even larger. Michael&acute;s own film crew joins the other TV crews already out amongst the fans. Getting fan reactions, testimonials along with words of praise and adoration from the sea of people crowded outside the Desert Passage Mall. Club MJJF, being the meek people they are, made certain they were seen. Jumping right in front of the cameras, making certain their signs were in view, they proceeded to give their testimonies about Michael Jackson. The Faze and Fallyn of the KING OF POP Empire received a message from Stuart Backerman directed to Patricia Brown/MJJForum, &quot;Trish is such a nice lady and we appreciate what MJJForum Fan Community does for Michael Jackson and the fans&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now its 3PM PST, the crowd of fans has grown even larger. At least 500 people are outside with the Mayor waiting to make the presentation. They are just awaiting Michael&acute;s arrival. In true Michael style, the King of Pop arrived close to an hour late. Just after 4PM PST Michael arrived wearing black pants, a red jacket and tinted aviator glasses.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The presentation was under way as E&acute;Cassanova said a few words to Michael&acute;s adoring fans! One of the keynote statements E&acute;Cassanova made to the screaming crowd was &quot;Michael Jackson fans don&acute;t die, we multiply!&quot; He then introduced The Mayor who then presented Michael Jackson with the Key to the city. Michael made a brief speech by thanking the fans for their support. Michael also collected various signs and banners from the fans. MJJForum will bring you more news as we receive it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;MJFC&rdquo; (October 25, 2003) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101220045949/www.mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=163:2003-october&amp;catid=166:2003&amp;Itemid=75"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Over three hundred fans were on hand to see Mayor Goodman present Michael Jackson with the key to the city of Las Vegas in a ceremony held this afternoon at the Art Of Music Store at the Desert Passage Mall in Vegas.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The ceremony began about an hour later than the original 3:00 time with the King Of Pop being introduced by one of the leading tribute artists, E Cassanova.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael spoke briefly, thanking the Mayor and the audience, telling the fans that &quot;I love you more.&quot; He then walked through the crowd, greeting the fans and signing autographs.
