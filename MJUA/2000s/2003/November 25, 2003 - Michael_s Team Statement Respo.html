We will be absolutely relentless in our pursuit of any and all extortionists regardless of how they try to gift wrap their lies in the cloak of justice. Michael is not going to be a pi&ntilde;ata for every money-hungry publicity seeker to strike in the hopes of hitting it rich.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">			</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The videotape was made on November 20th while Michael and his attorney flew from Las Vegas to Santa Barbara for the singer&#39;s processing on criminal charges. The judge&#39;s ruling prohibits XtraJet from releasing the tape until a hearing next month where a permanent prohibition will be sought.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">			</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Anyone watching this case can see that new lows are being hit every day. Motivated parties are taking obscene measures to injure Michael with false allegations. We will aggressively challenge the rogue&#39;s gallery of grifters who are seeking dividends from Michael&#39;s ordeal. There is a very real, human price being exacted here, and Michael will do what it takes to safeguard his family and his name.</span></p></body>
