These efforts may also result in civil and/or criminal charges, where appropriate. In addition, there is a strong possibility that these documents will be forwarded to the U.S. Attorney General for review and possible involvement.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Mr. Jackson is neither shocked or surprised by these revelations,&rdquo; says Raymone K. Bain, Michael Jackson&rsquo;s General Manager. &ldquo;Based on the timing of events that have impacted his personal and professional life in recent years, he has long been suspicious that some of those whom he entrusted to act on his behalf, and to advise him with respect to his personal and business affairs, may not have always acted in his best interests.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
