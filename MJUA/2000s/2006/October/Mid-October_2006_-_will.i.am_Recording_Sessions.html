It started galloping away. So I&#39;m galloping down the meadows up in Ireland, going apple picking. So, as the horse went to grab an apple, I remember Michael Jackson saying, &quot;Just don&#39;t let him get the apple, just grab it before he does.&quot; I&#39;m on a horse, the horse goes there and I grab it, and he&#39;s like--last thing I&#39;m worrying about is, like, he get mad at me, and then kick me off his back, and stomp on me... So my thing was grab an apple, let him eat an apple, right? So let&#39;s share, right? &#39;Cause I&#39;m on his back. So, that was the whole thing. So he grabbed the apple, then I grab the apple. So, then I came back with the bag of apples, and he was like, &quot;So how was it? Wasn&#39;t it amazing?
