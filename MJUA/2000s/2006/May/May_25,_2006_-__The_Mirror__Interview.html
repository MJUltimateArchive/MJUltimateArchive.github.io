He said: &quot;I&#39;m here in London on business for a couple of days. I love it here.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;m looking for a place to live. I&#39;ve always liked the UK and I just love the fans here.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He grinned as he added: &quot;I&#39;m also visiting my good friend Mohamed - &#39;cos he&#39;s the man.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has lined up a series of business meetings in the UK and will be looking at a luxury properties in and around the capital.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also plans to view places in Scotland and Ireland in a bid to re-create the funfair-style California ranch that was once his sanctuary.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Asked about his health, Jackson insisted: &quot;I&#39;m fine - very well thanks. I&#39;m feeling good.&quot; He says he is also working on a new album - his first since Invincible in 2001.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then, with a gentle pat on the back, he said goodbye and we went our separate ways.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As I left to catch the Tube back to the office and he headed to his chauffeur-driven limo, I could still detect the faint aroma of his perfume on my hand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I think I may have witnessed the first tentative steps of Jackson&#39;s emergence from the shadows.</span></p></body>
