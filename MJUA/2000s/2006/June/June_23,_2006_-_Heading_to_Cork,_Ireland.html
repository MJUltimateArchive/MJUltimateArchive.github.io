Relieved he had found a sanctuary away from the paparazzi and enchanted by an area so rich in history, myth and folklore, Jackson ended up staying for the rest of the year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Grouse Lodge is a secluded Georgian estate located down an unsigned, winding, potholed gravel drive near the village of Rosemount. It was converted into a residential recording studio in 2002 by owners Paddy and Claire Dunning, and has been used by everyone from REM to Doves, Muse to Ms Dynamite, Snow Patrol to Shirley Bassey. Paddy is a modern-day renaissance man in his mid-40s whose life at times seems only slightly less fantastical than Jackson&#39;s. He started out as a Dublin dustman and became one of the founding fathers of the resurgence of the Temple Bar district of the capital. Now his Dublin businesses include Temple Lane Studios, the Sound Training Centre, the Button Factory nightclub and The National Wax Museum Plus.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 2006 a woman called Grace Rwaramba arrived to check out Grouse Lodge studio for an unnamed A-list pop star. She liked what she saw and booked the studio plus a three-bed cottage on the grounds that had been converted from a cowshed. But she still didn&#39;t reveal who the artist was. Paddy and Claire only discovered the identity of their new lodger when a bus turned up and out trooped Prince Michael Junior, Paris and Blanket, followed by their father Michael Jackson, nanny Grace and the children&#39;s tutor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Grouse Lodge is set around an old farmyard, and there&#39;s a collection of converted outbuildings that form a second grassed courtyard, none of which is visible from the road, so it&#39;s not hard to see why Jackson felt safe and secluded here. He began work on new material at Grouse Lodge with Will.I.Am and Rodney Jerkins, producers who flew in from America.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson fell in love with County Westmeath and, after a month in the converted cowshed, moved to the equally secluded neighbouring estate of Coolatore, also owned by the Dunnings. Because Jackson didn&#39;t have his own driver in Ireland, Paddy enlisted local taxi driver Ray O&#39;Hara to drive Michael and the kids around in a borrowed people carrier with blacked-out windows.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Dunnings somehow managed to keep the fact that the King of Pop was in residence a secret for several months. Even when Jackson began to venture out and there were rumoured sightings of him in the nearby villages of Moate or Kilbeggan, the Dunnings would deny all knowledge. &quot;If someone said to me I&#39;ve heard Michael Jackson is there, I would tell them: &#39;Yeah, so is Elvis Presley!&#39; says Paddy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The only security Grouse Lodge arranged was to post three guards on rotation at the top of the drive to intercept unwelcome visitors. When word eventually began to leak out, locals in the know became protective of Jackson, sending reporters the wrong way, and one farmer even threatened to empty his slurry trailer over the car of a paparazzo.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Irish Midlands are often overlooked by people rushing from Dublin to Galway or other parts of the west coast, but it&#39;s a magical land dotted with ringforts and medieval castles. Within a few miles of Coolatore are the twin historic hills of Cnoc Aiste and Uisneach; there&#39;s Lough Ennell and Lilliput, where Jonathan Swift first conceived Gulliver&#39;s Travels (Paddy is planning on an eco village in woods near Lough Ennell, along with a seven-storey model of Gulliver); and Locke&#39;s Distillery in Kilbeggan, now a museum. There are also a few local pubs that haven&#39;t changed for decades, such as the William Fox in Loughnavalley, and Gunnings in Rathconrath, which doubles as shop, newsagent, garage and community centre.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Traditionally, the hill of Uisneach is the geographical centre of Ireland. It&#39;s only 600ft high, but from the top you can see 20 counties on a clear day. It was the ancient seat of the kings of Meath, the most sacred site in the world in Pagan times, and home of the ancient festival of the fires, Bealtaine, which attracted Egyptians up the Shannon 2,000 years ago. It&#39;s also home to the Cat Stone (or Stone of Divisions), said to be the burial place of the goddess &Eacute;riu (who gave her name to Ireland, or Eire) and where the ancient provinces of Ireland were divided.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Uisneach is now part of the farm belonging to David Clarke, and on 1 May this year, Clarke and Paddy organised the first Festival of the Fires for more than 1,000 years, attracting a diverse mix of locals, farmers, clairvoyants, witches, wizards and gurus from far and wide. A beacon was lit on Uisneach, sparking a chain of fires on 73 different hills across the country, from Dingle to Donegal. &quot;Michael was interested in history,&quot; says Paddy, &quot;and smitten by the intricacies of Irish music.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Dunnings have a wealth of stories from the time they spent with Jackson. &quot;One night we ended up in the studio,&quot; Paddy recalls. &quot;Michael was on the drums, I was playing guitar and [American producer] Nephew was on the keyboards and we just started getting a rhythm together, and slowly but surely Nephew just creeped the song in to &#39;Billie Jean&#39;. It was just mad playing &#39;Billie Jean&#39; with Michael Jackson &ndash; I never thought I&#39;d do that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Paddy is a natural raconteur. He tells me how, when he bought the Wax Museum Plus &ndash; Dublin&#39;s answer to Madame Tussauds &ndash; the resident Elvis was looking a little tired, so Paddy retired him, placing him in the woods by Coolatore. He had forgotten about him until Michael Jackson came in from a walk one day looking shaken. &quot;Paddy,&quot; he said, &quot;I just met my father-in-law in the woods!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Towards the end of his stay in Westmeath, Jackson started to look at prospective houses to buy. When the Dunnings bought a further property, Bishopstown House, a derelict Georgian estate a mile or so away, Jackson visited it and discussed the renovations with Paddy. So, although it would be a little disingenuous to call Bishopstown the House that Jackson built, it&#39;s certainly the house built with Jackson in mind. Jackson had a base in London for his ill-fated 50-date run of gigs at the O2, but according to Paddy he also planned to spend time in Ireland, escaping the media glare of the English capital.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Both Coolatore and the newly converted Bishopstown are now available for hire. Coolatore is the larger estate of the two &ndash; a beautiful 1866 Victorian country retreat with long halls and vaulted ceilings, grand living and dining rooms, a library and a hidden staircase that leads down to a basement bar installed by the Guinness family. Bishopstown, having been derelict for years before the Dunnings took it over, has been converted in a much more contemporary style, with a wood- clad extension added to the original Georgian house, along with a secret fourth-floor roof garden, designed to afford Jackson panoramic views of the countryside without being seen himself. Both houses have six bedrooms and five bathrooms.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The houses are rented primarily as self-catering properties, and if you use all the available beds, they can work out costing &euro;100 a night each. It is also possible to have meals supplied by nearby Grouse Lodge (they can also arrange everything from massages to clay pigeon shooting), with menus focusing on local produce and vegetables grown in their own walled garden. Claire and the staff at Grouse Lodge cooked for Jackson, who favoured a simple, healthy diet of porridge for breakfast and main meals of fish or chicken with vegetables. &quot;The guy was fit &ndash; he was getting stronger,&quot; Paddy says, &quot;and I reckon if he had lived here and stayed here, he wouldn&#39;t have died.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.herald.ie/news/irish-trip-revealed-downtoearth-family-man-27916399.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Herald&rdquo; (June 27, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191011214326/https://www.herald.ie/news/irish-trip-revealed-downtoearth-family-man-27916399.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson&#39;s hunt for a secret hideaway in Ireland revealed an unseen side to the superstar -- a down-to-earth family man and perfect gentlemen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The King of Pop sought refuge in Co Cork and scoured the area for an island or castle safe haven to avoid the public glare after being acquitted of child abuse.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those who met him were quick to dispel urban myths which shrouded the pop icon, claiming he would shake hands, introduced his children to strangers and enjoyed takeaway food.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Estate agent Dominic Daly spent two days with Jackson, his three children and their entourage as the singer searched for an idyllic hideaway in 2006.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was more forthcoming at first, I got a shock,&quot; Mr Daly said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He shook my hand, I don&#39;t know if I was expecting it as I was always led to believe that he didn&#39;t shake hands. It was a very firm strong handshake.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Undemanding</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Daly introduced Jackson to Des McGahan, owner of the Ballinacurra House estate near Kinsale, Co Cork, who recalled one of the undemanding superstar&#39;s few requests.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;After 11pm, one of his requests was to put on all the lights when all the kids had gone to bed,&quot; Mr McGahan said. &quot;We couldn&#39;t work it out and after two nights my intrigue got the better of me. I stuck my head in between the hedges to see what was going on and as I describe it he was doing a moonwalk under moonlight -- practising his dance moves.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also dismissed rumours Jackson was a fussy eater.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We had to take a few spins up to Cork [city] to KFC and Chinese takeaways to feed him on occasions,&quot; Mr McGahan said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr McGahan said the singer only wanted to enjoy time with his kids, who he described as well grounded, respectful and normal.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They&#39;d say please and thank-you and would not do anything without permission,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And far from being a recluse, Jackson left the relative peace and security of the estate to walk through the seaside town of Kinsale, look at the old-fashioned shops and see the Old Head of Kinsale beauty spot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Daly said: &quot;People in the town would have said &#39;is that a Michael Jackson lookalike?&quot;&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Daly added: &quot;He had been told that Ireland was a safe haven. That he wasn&#39;t going to be harassed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, Jackson&#39;s plan to settle in Ireland never materialised.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/friends-remember-michaels-special-fondness-for-ireland-26546931.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; (June 28, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191014162150/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/friends-remember-michaels-special-fondness-for-ireland-26546931.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Irish friends of the star have begun to piece together a rare picture of the man behind the mask.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A restless soul who found the tranquillity he desperately craved in the Irish countryside. A gentle spirit who loved Flahavan&#39;s porridge, indulged in hot apple tart and cream and who only really came to life in the quietness of a Cork woodland.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">These glimpses of the private Michael Jackson have materialised among dozens of tributes which have poured in from well-known Irish personalities as the world mourns the loss of one of music&#39;s greats.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For the first time, castle owner Patrick Nordstrum, who hosted Jackson during his 2006 stay in Ireland, has spoken fondly of the star he personally came to know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking about the entertainer who lived with him for two weeks at his home, Blackwater Castle in Co Cork, Mr Nordstrum described private chats that the pair had about the singer&#39;s feelings towards the vulturistic world he lived in.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t think he ever had any kind of peace or normality since he was a child. I would see him as a restless soul but he felt quite homely here. He was very careful about who he trusted. He once told me how he had gone to stay at another castle to seek out privacy and he had just landed in the helicopter a few minutes when the owner took him straight inside, opened a door and there was a hundred or so people waiting there to meet him. So he was understandably very wary.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also described how Jackson, long vilified for dressing his children in black veils and hiding them away from the world, was in fact a model father who placed his children&#39;s interests above all else.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;His children adored him and he was a very good, loving father. He brought them here because they had been hunted down in Disneyland Paris and they were looking for a place to escape. He raised them to be very well mannered and very polite and all his decision&#39;s centred on the children&#39;s best interests.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Recalling some light-hearted memories of his time with Jackson he said, &quot;My wife Sheila is very much into her healthy food and she had a bowl of porridge every morning so she gave some to Michael, he loved it and he insisted on having a bowl every morning from then on.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, magician Liam Sheehan, who was brought in to entertain Jackson&#39;s children during his stay at the castle, described his sadness upon hearing the news.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The man that I came to know was kind-hearted and a gentleman. It is tragic that he spent his life being hunted. I hope he has found his little piece of heaven now.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He went on: &quot;His children adored him. They would ask me if I would race their dad and tell me proudly that he would win because he was so tall and fast. You could tell they really looked up to him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Mr Sheehan spoke of the disciplined way in which Jackson reared his offspring. &quot;Even at the end of their stay, when they were leaving for home, the children jumped into the limousine and Michael made them get out again and come over to thank each and every one of us for our hospitality.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Painting the picture of an ordinary character who enjoyed the simple pleasures in life, he said: &quot;His real personality only really emerged in the privacy of the woods. The shyness left him and I saw a much more boisterous and loud spirit who loved playing with his children. That quiet-spoken Michael that you would see in the media instantly disappeared.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He loved apple pie and ice-cream and really enjoyed being in the privacy of the castle grounds and I know he loved the friendliness of the Irish people.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Paddy Dunning, who owns residential recording studio Grouse Lodge, near Moate, Co Westmeath, was host to Michael Jackson and his three children in October 2006.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The pop icon caused a sensation when he moved into the Georgian estate at Rosemount, just off the Dublin-Galway road.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael had originally only intended staying in Westmeath for a month, but ended up living here for five months,&quot; says Dunning who&#39;s abiding memory of the star was how he casually displayed his immense musical genius.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael was an amazing guitarist, he was incredible on the drums, he stunned everyone when he got behind the piano, but most of all, you can&#39;t overstate his singing voice.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dunning became a close confident to Michael during his stay and was in contact with the Jackson family after his death was announced. He confirmed this weekend that Jackson loved his time in Ireland so much he&#39;d even pledged to return this autumn to open the National Wax Museum in Dublin.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He told me that he would definitely pop over when he came for his gigs in London,&quot; Dunning said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He would have settled down here for while, I have no doubt about that, he loved Ireland and Westmeath.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Hollywood neighbour and friend of the singer Michael Flatley also joined the country&#39;s mourners in paying their respect to an icon that shaped a generation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking from Las Vegas, the dancer, who hosted Michael Jackson in his Cork home, Castlehyde, near Fermoy, described the star as a &quot;wonderful&quot; person who fell victim to unfair treatment by the world&#39;s media.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I knew Michael as a man, not just a performer, and he was a great man. The world will miss this wonderful person and his moving performances. My heart goes out to Michael&#39;s family.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He went on: &quot;I was shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news. He was a genius as a musician and a dancer. The press at times was horribly unfair to this man. Unfortunately, the media tend to make fun of things they cannot understand.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Flatley, dancer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35259896/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/secret-life-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">NBC Dateline (February 5, 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">NBC Dateline: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">So [Michael] and his family left the Mideast and headed west.

Michael was such a great performer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep6week44/piers-morgans-life-stories"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Piers Morgan&rsquo;s Life Stories&rdquo; interview (November 1, 2013)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/VWAx178GmiQ"><span class="cs8567212B">video</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Morgan:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&#39;s been your most impressive house guest?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Flatley:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Michael Jackson came and stayed with us at CastleHyde.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Morgan:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Did he drink Guinness at your place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Flatley:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> &ldquo;Am I allowed to answer that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Morgan:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Flatley:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, he did. Not much, but a little bit.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Morgan:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Incredible experience.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Flatley: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah. I personally loved him. I don&rsquo;t know anything about his private business, or his private life, and, in fairness, it&rsquo;s none of my business. But I did love him, he was a lovely man. He treated his children really well in front of me, and that&rsquo;s the man that I know. And I was sad to see him go.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Morgan:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And he loved &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, didn&rsquo;t he?

Michael and myself were born in the same year. And he came to my costume room and I have all of these old costumes from the tours and we were reminiscing about things and I said, &lsquo;You know, why don&rsquo;t we do something together and we&rsquo;ll call it 50/50?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Morgan: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">If you two had actually ended up on a stage together, dancing, as friendly as it starts, there would have been a few seconds in that moment where you were like, &lsquo;Right, Michael Jackson.&rsquo; And when that moment came who would have won?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Flatley: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Oh come on.

Jackson flew in musicians from America to make the album while living at Grouse Lodge, Co. Westmeath, and was planning to return to Ireland within weeks to finish it off after his planned 50-night run in London at the 02 arena.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The as-yet unnamed album includes tracks written by Akon, Ne-Yo and Will.i .am of the Black Eyed Peas and would certainly top the charts around the globe. Record industry insiders said the record had taken years to produce but was &quot;a return to form&quot; for the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson had been dumped by Sony in 2001 and had not had a top 10 hit in the US since then. Last night, Grouse Lodge owner Paddy Dunning revealed,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was expected back in a few weeks time to finish off the album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was produced by Will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas and features all these fantastic musicians on it. He flew them all in from America to play on it. I don&#39;t know what will happen to it now. I suppose that it will be released one way or the other. It sounds absolutely brilliant to me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He had told me how much he was looking forward to coming back to finish it off. Now we&#39;ll never see him again. He was in great form when he stayed with us and we got quite close. Before then I never knew what a brilliant musician he was. He could play piano, guitar and drums really well. I saw him performing and singing brilliantly in the studio.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was certainly on top form. He loved staying here and said it helped his creativity.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now the race is on to turn the lost Jackson tapes into a finished album ready for release. The reclusive singer spent five months making what was to be his new album at Grouse Lodge in 2007. The album could now become one of the biggest-selling discs of all time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Tony Wadsworth, chairman of the British Phonographic Industry, said,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There would be a huge amount of interest in this album. The rapid sell-out of the live dates and the overwhelming reaction to his passing are sure signs that a release of new good-quality Michael Jackson music could see him back at the top of the charts.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And a music industry source added,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;This album will be absolutely huge. It&#39;s the last thing Michael ever did.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It&#39;s almost finished and now it will be brought out as a tribute to him in the coming months. Millions of fans worldwide are now snapping up all his old albums in tribute to him. Can you imagine how many will buy this album because they know it&#39;s going to be the final original album?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last night, Grouse Lodge owner Paddy Dunning said he was heartbroken to hear of Jackson&#39;s death. He recalled his time with the star and his children, Prince Michael, Paris and Blanket, and revealed how Jackson was a true musical genius. Jackson&#39;s children even went to school in Rosemount village along with his own children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He seemed very happy here, they all did. And we enjoyed having them. He had no entourage at all with him, just his children and they were really well-mannered kids.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He wasn&#39;t a big drinker or anything, but he did like a glass of wine with his meals. However, he never went down to the local pub or that.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dunning also revealed how Michael was hugely interested in Irish legends and stories and was very knowledgeable about Irish mythology. And contrary to popular opinion, the singer was not a fussy eater, in particular enjoying the traditional Irish breakfast.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several international stars have recorded at Grouse Lodge, with singer Shirley Bassey booked in at the moment. The studio has 15 acres of grounds where Jackson and his family often went for long walks.</span></p></body>
