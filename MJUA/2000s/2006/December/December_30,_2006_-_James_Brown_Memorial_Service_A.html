Fans lined up in the rain before dawn to get in. When James Brown Arena was full, they gathered on the streets outside to listen to the service over a public address system.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and a tearful Michael Jackson were among those who took turns at the podium overlooking the casket where Brown lay in a black jacket and gloves, red shirt and sequined shoes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We come to thank God for James Brown, because only God could have made a James Brown possible,&rdquo; said Sharpton, a longtime Brown confidant who also spoke at a boisterous ceremony Thursday at the famed Apollo Theater in New York and a private service Friday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brown, 73, died of heart failure Dec. 25 in Atlanta while hospitalized for treatment of pneumonia. Jesse Jackson said Saturday that Brown had &ldquo;upstaged Santa on Christmas Day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson, whose arrival sparked a roar from the crowd, bowed before the casket and shared a hug with Sharpton just as Brown&rsquo;s latest backup band, the Soul Generals, started to play.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;James Brown is my greatest inspiration,&rdquo; the pop star told mourners, adding that when he was a child, his mother would wake him, regardless of the hour, whenever Brown was on TV.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;When I saw him move, I was mesmerized,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I knew that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brown was born in Barnwell, S.C., in 1933 and spent much of his childhood in Augusta, singing and dancing for change on street corners. Even when he became an international superstar, Brown considered Augusta his home.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Much of the funeral took on the feel of one of Brown&rsquo;s famously high-energy concerts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Soul Generals cranked out Brown hits including &ldquo;Soul Power,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Feel Good&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Man&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s World&rdquo; for a crowd that clapped, cheered and danced in the aisles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I can hear Mr. Brown now,&rdquo; said Charles Bobbitt, Brown&rsquo;s longtime manager who was with him when he died. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s saying &lsquo;St. Peter &hellip; I don&rsquo;t deal with the middle man. Take me to the main man.&rdquo;&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The service was followed by a private burial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brown&rsquo;s hits, such as &ldquo;I Got You (I Feel Good)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s Got A Brand New Bag,&rdquo; inspired generations of soul, funk, disco, rock and rap artists.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A day earlier, thousands of fans poured into the Apollo in Harlem for a sometimes raucous celebration of Brown at the venue where one of his concerts launched him into the international spotlight in 1956.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was a God-sent person &mdash; almost like an angel,&rdquo; said Vickie Greene, who saw her first Brown show more than 30 years ago and attended Saturday&rsquo;s ceremony.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">While growing up in Augusta, Brown sometimes committed petty crimes that landed him in reform school. In later years, he returned annually to give away Thanksgiving turkeys to needy families. The community was also the scene of a drug-fueled police chase that landed Brown a 15-month stint in prison.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The city named a street after Brown a decade ago and last year erected a statue of him in a downtown park. Earlier this year, Augusta&rsquo;s main auditorium was also named in his honor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1549061/james-brown-saluted-by-michael-jackson-at-public-funeral-service/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;MTV News&rdquo; (December 30, 2006)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181231163124/http://www.mtv.com/news/1549061/james-brown-saluted-by-michael-jackson-at-public-funeral-service/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was only fitting that James Brown&#39;s funeral turned into a concert Saturday afternoon (December 30) as he was laid to rest in his hometown of Augusta, Georgia.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">More than 8,000 people &mdash; Brown&#39;s family, friends and fans &mdash; watched from the floor of James Brown Arena as the singer&#39;s celebrity friends including Michael Jackson, MC Hammer and Bootsy Collins gave tribute onstage at the public &quot;homegoing&quot; service for the singer, who died of congestive heart failure early Monday morning.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Reverend Al Sharpton &mdash; who said the iconic musician was like a father to him &mdash; gave a stirring sermon, the &quot;Godfather of Soul&quot; was best remembered at the ceremony through his songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A videotape of one of Brown&#39;s concerts &mdash; where he performed selections including &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; &mdash; was played. Later in the service, Brown&#39;s own Soul Generals band performed songs including &quot;Sex Machine&quot; while various people sang, Brown&#39;s former bandmate Bootsy Collins joined in on bass and Hammer danced. At the end of &quot;Sex Machine,&quot; Brown&#39;s famous cape was laid upon his casket just as it was laid across his back so many times during his concerts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During Sharpton&#39;s sermon, the reverend revealed his last conversation with Brown, during which the &quot;Godfather of Soul&quot; told him that there was a need for performers such as Michael Jackson to keep making positive music for all people.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson himself stepped up to the podium and said that he was inspired by Brown from an early age.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;James Brown is my greatest inspiration,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;When I saw him move, I was mesmerized. ... I never saw a performer move like James Brown. ... James Brown, I shall miss you, and I love you so much. Thank you for everything.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The service was the third memorial in as many days for Brown, who was honored with a public viewing at New York&#39;s Apollo Theater on Thursday, and a private ceremony for family and close friends in Georgia on Friday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-brown-jackson/michael-jackson-praises-james-brown-as-inspiration-idUSN3026508420061231"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Reuters&rdquo; (January 21, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191001202253/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-brown-jackson/michael-jackson-praises-james-brown-as-inspiration-idUSN3026508420061231"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson praised Brown as an inspiration after being invited to the stage by Sharpton during his eulogy of &ldquo;the godfather of soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the media says tonight, James Brown wanted Michael Jackson with him here today,&rdquo; Sharpton said in a booming voice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He said ... &lsquo;I love Michael.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Tell him don&rsquo;t worry about coming home.
