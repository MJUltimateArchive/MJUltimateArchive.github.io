Is that how it really went down?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chris Tucker: [Laughs] It did go down sorta like that. It was amazing. I was there with the king watching the prince. I&rsquo;m sitting with Michael, and I kept looking at Michael and looking at [Prince]. I&rsquo;m wondering, is he going to say something? Is he going to respond? And Michael was like [impersonating Michael and clapping], &ldquo;Very good, very good.&rdquo; He was excited and happy for Prince.

So Prince invited me to perform with him at the Palms. Maybe you can come see me perform with Prince. So Michael Jackson says, &ldquo;Oh really? I&rsquo;d love to. Call Prince and see if it&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; I call Prince&rsquo;s assistant. She&rsquo;s like sure. So I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Yo, Mike, it&rsquo;s great.&rdquo; Come on, dude. This shit ain&rsquo;t real. To me, that that happened, it sounds like a big ass lie, right? Yeah, I&rsquo;ll just call Prince and then bring Michael Jackson but it&rsquo;s the realest shit. So, I&rsquo;m late. I&rsquo;m late. I&rsquo;m in the cab, like aw, man, what a time to be fuckin&rsquo; late. I&rsquo;m always late and I&rsquo;m late for Michael Jackson to see me perform with Prince. So I hop off the cab and I&rsquo;m running in Las Vegas. I&rsquo;m running and people are like, &ldquo;Wyclef!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like fuck you, right? Then I run and I get to the place and I perform for Prince and I walk off stage and Michael&rsquo;s there. He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;That was awesome.&rdquo; Mind you, we were already in Ireland. He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;That was awesome. I didn&rsquo;t know you rapped.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t know I rap? I&rsquo;m in the Black Eyed Peas.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was you that was the rapper. I thought it was the other guy.&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s me, dude.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awesome, that was awesome. We need to do something like that on my record where you rap and I sing.&rdquo; Yeah, but that was a great experience to have Mike see me perform with Prince. It was nuts.

But they&rsquo;ve never really acknowledged that I write. I wrote &ldquo;Billie Jean,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; &ldquo;Man in the Mirror,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Are the World&rdquo; . . . big songs. I have so much love for Prince.

I think everything will be great.&quot; So I hang up the phone, call this lady named Ruth, who then would put me in contact with Prince. I was saying, &quot;Michael Jackson wants to come to the show, can you put him in a VIP section where no one knows he&#39;s there?&quot; So Prince said, &quot;Oh yeah, we can arrange that.&quot; So I get off the phone, called Michael Jackson and said, &quot;It&#39;s set, everything&#39;s gonna be great.&quot; We walk him to the VIP room. We get off the stage, [goes to] sit down with me, Prince and his manager, and Chris Tucker. So then Prince is playing the bass, walks off the stage, walks to our area, our section where Michael Jackson&#39;s at. Now say, for example, you (Ellen) are Michael Jackson, I&#39;m Prince. [Proceeds to imitate playing bass in Ellen&#39;s face] And goes off to the stage, right?

It was me, Chris Tucker, Michael Jackson watching Prince rock on stage. So, to make a long story short, Prince steps off the stage and plays the bass in Michael Jackson&#39;s face, rips the freaking bass, ten different pieces. To make a longer story shorter, Michael Jackson leaves and goes home and says, &quot;Meet me in the house for breakfast.&quot; So I go to his house for breakfast, knock on the door, first words, he says, &quot;Why was Prince playing the bass in my face?&quot; &quot;Oh, Prince, he&#39;s just being nice&quot; &quot;No, Prince, he&#39;s always been a meanie.&quot; But, bless their hearts, they were so passionate and we lost a great&hellip;</span></p></body>
