The 33-island archipelago is about the size of Rhode Island.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I am incredibly excited about my new venture and I am enjoying being back in the studio making music,&rdquo; Jackson said in a statement released in London on behalf of the Bahrain-based record label.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The label &mdash; which is due to release Jackson&rsquo;s long-promised Hurricane Katrina benefit single, &ldquo;I Have This Dream&rdquo; &mdash; said British music executive Guy Holmes had been named chief executive of the company. It said Holmes would oversee the making of the new album &ldquo;and the management of Michael&rsquo;s other business interests.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has been plagued by financial problems since his trial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last month, he closed the house on his 2,600-acre Neverland Ranch estate in California, laying off most of the staff after agreeing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in back wages to avoid a lawsuit by state labor officials.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last week, he agreed to restructure his finances in a deal with Sony Corp (NYSE:SNE &ndash; news)., which shares ownership with Jackson of a valuable music catalog that includes the Beatles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">No details of that agreement were released, but earlier published reports said Jackson was negotiating a debt refinancing plan that would save him from bankruptcy but take away part of his share of the catalog.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s last studio album of new material was 2001&rsquo;s &ldquo;Invincible.&rdquo; Several compilations have been released since.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Prince, studio engineer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-052-michael-prince-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 52 (March 19, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I can only imagine what [the 2003 &quot;Xscape&quot; leak and 2008 &quot;Hold My Hand&quot; leak] would do to the mind of a perfectionist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, and it&#39;s like--I talked to an engineer friend of mine, and he had flown over to Ireland several times with Rodney... Remember when Michael was staying at that guy&#39;s (Michael Flatley) really nice house... and I asked my friend, who&#39;s a good engineer as well, I said, &quot;So, you went over there with Rodney a couple times?&quot; He goes, &quot;Yeah, but we never recorded any vocals&quot;. And that didn&#39;t surprise me. And in all the conversations I&#39;ve had with John Barnes--John Barnes spent more than a year in Bahrain working with Michael. I never came out and </span><span class="cs43C038A">asked </span><span class="csD5D7D290">him asked him, but he sort of intimated that Michael didn&#39;t sing over there at all. I think he just--he knew that once his vocal was on there, if somebody put it out, he had completely lost control of that song. And as long it was an instrumental, it was worthless.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman, author, &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Amongst a selection of new and cover versions that were said to have been recorded for a planned album on 2 Sea Records were:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Ferry Cross the Mersey&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He Who Makes The Sky Grey&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Into Something Good&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Light The Way&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I Have This Dream&rdquo; (Charity Single)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Bill Bottrell flew to Bahrain in 2006/07, where Michael was staying as a guest of the Prince of Bahrain, Abdulla Hamad Al-Khalifa after the stress of his trial acquittal in May, 2005. Michael was working on a few unfinished tracks while over there, with Brian MacCleod also helping out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fans heard a minute of the instrumental for the song called, &lsquo;Out Of Our Heads,&rsquo; on soundcloud, before it was quickly deleted.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/jackson-sued-for-reneging-on-deal-to-perform-sheikhs-songs-1023094.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Independent&rdquo; (November 18, 2008)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081229224302/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/jackson-sued-for-reneging-on-deal-to-perform-sheikhs-songs-1023094.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The pop superstar Michael Jackson reneged on an agreement that he would perform songs written by an Arab sheikh who paid him $7m (&pound;4.7m), the High Court has heard.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sheikh Abdulla bin Hamad Al Khalifa &ndash; the second son of the King of Bahrain &ndash; is suing Jackson for the return of $7m which he claims he loaned to the singer who was in financial trouble in 2005 amid his criminal trial over child molestation charges.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also says he set up Jackson with a recording studio at his Neverland ranch and then sent him his own compositions, one of which was recorded and is to be played to the court.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson insists payments made by the sheikh were &quot;gifts&quot; and that there was no valid agreement between them which committed him to a recording contract, writing an autobiography and producing a musical stage play.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bankim Thanki QC, representing Sheikh Abdulla, told Mr Justice Sweeney that the day after the end of Jackson&#39;s trial in California, the star recorded one of the compositions which the sheikh wanted released as a charity single to help victims of the Boxing Day tsunami. &quot;It shows the quality of Sheikh Abdulla&#39;s songwriting skills and that of Mr Jackson&#39;s voice,&quot; he told the judge.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two had a &quot;close personal relationship&quot; and discussed the chances of Jackson moving to Bahrain to &quot;continue their musical collaboration in a more conducive environment&quot;, said Mr. Thanki. Sheikh Abdulla had plans to revive Jackson&#39;s career, releasing records through their own label.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Mr Thanki said the sheikh was first asked by an assistant of Jackson for $35,000 to pay utility bills at Neverland. &quot;Sheikh Abdulla began to support Mr Jackson financially after 2005 when it became clear that Mr Jackson was in very serious financial difficulties, much to Sheikh Abdulla&#39;s surprise,&quot; said Mr Thanki. Sheikh Abdulla is suing Jackson for allegedly reneging on a &quot;pay-back&quot; agreement he says applies to all the money. He further claims he and Jackson entered into a &quot;combined rights agreement&quot; (CRA) over their musical collaboration.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the start of the hearing in London, Mr Justice Sweeney heard that an application would be made for Jackson to give evidence via video link from Los Angeles. Jackson, who is contesting the claim, says Sheikh Abdulla&#39;s case is based on &quot;mistake, misrepresentation and undue influence&quot; and that no project was ever finalised. He admits he signed a document which he understood gave him a substantial shareholding in Sheikh Abdulla&#39;s 2 Seas recording company. But he challenges the sheikh&#39;s description of him as &quot;an experienced businessman&quot; and says he did not read the terms of the document.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson claims the contract was entered into on the basis of &quot;false representations&quot; that the recording company was &quot;capable of releasing and distributing, on a worldwide basis, recordings by an artist of international repute&quot;. He also alleges that Sheikh Abdulla, a powerful and influential public figure, exercised &quot;undue influence&quot; over him when he was emotionally exhausted after his criminal trial.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson travelled to Bahrain at the sheikh&#39;s invitation following his acquittal. Among Sheikh Abdulla&#39;s complaints is that, despite his having paid the cost of Jackson recording a song called &quot;I Have This Dream&quot; &ndash; intended to benefit the victims of Hurricane Katrina which hit New Orleans in August 2005 &ndash; the singer did not attend the studio for the final recording and the song was never released.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sheikh Abdulla claims that both he and Jackson agreed the quality of his vocal track was not good enough for the single, but the star failed to attend the studios to re-record the song.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A DVD of the making of the recording of &quot;I Have This Dream&quot; in the Metropolis Studio was played in court. It showed screaming fans mobbing the star as he arrived, then Jackson singing a few lines from &quot;I&#39;m Into Something Good&quot; and &quot;Ferry &#39;Cross The Mersey&quot; before trying a couple of lines from &quot;I Have This Dream&quot;.</span></p></body>
