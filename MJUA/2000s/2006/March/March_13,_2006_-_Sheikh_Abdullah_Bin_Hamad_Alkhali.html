		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sheikh Abdullah Bin Hamad Alkhalifa Dinner Attendance</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Tim Cash, MTV News Staff, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1615449/my-dinner-with-michael-jackson-by-tim-kash/"><span class="cs8567212B">My Dinner With Michael Jackson</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Towards the end of an amazing week of some R&amp;R (racing and relaxing), I was invited along with John Legend, Tyson Beckford, DJ Whoo Kid, Simon Webbe and a few others to dinner at his palace.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Like kids visiting Disneyland, Whoo Kid and I were the first to get off the trucks when we arrived. A line of people, starting with the crown prince and his wife, was assembled to welcome us. It was then that I turned to Whoo Kid and whispered, &quot;Yo, that guy looks a lot like Michael Jackson, no?&quot; You see, we had no idea MJ was going to be there, my initial reaction was to think it was someone that looked </span><span class="cs43C038A">like</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> him and not actually him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He had shoulder-length black hair and was wearing a shiny black tuxedo with aviators tucked into his open white shirt. He knew how to dress. As I walked up to Michael, he extended his hand and said, &quot;Hi, Tim.&quot; That was weird, but I guessed he had been briefed prior to our arrival. Then I figured I&#39;d try to break the ice, so I said, &quot;Hi ... and you are?&quot; The prince and everyone within earshot looked at me with disbelief, but the King of Pop simply replied &quot;Michael&quot; with no sense of ego whatsoever. I smiled, &quot;I know,&quot; and we laughed. To the relief of everyone listening, Michael had a sense of humor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Before dinner, everyone sat down in the living room and made conversation with each other. Michael didn&#39;t say anything at first. He just sat back and played the observer, listening to the conversation, laughing at times and paying close attention at others.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Later, Michael, who had not initially planned to stay for dinner, casually announced that he&#39;d be sticking around. He did &mdash; for four hours.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Instead of moving to a grand dining room, the prince had decided to eat dinner in the living room and keep it on a casual vibe. The palace staff appeared and laid tables down and brought out an incredible buffet spread. MTV was actually playing on the TV, and my old MTV News show (which aired around Europe and the Middle East) came on during dinner. I slunk back in embarrassment as everyone&#39;s attention, including MJ&#39;s, turned to the TV.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A few things surprised me about the legend in real life: His voice was quiet but not as high-pitched as you might have heard him in interviews. Maybe that was part of his character. He wasn&#39;t wearing his signature aviators, but I remember seeing him sweep his hair in front of his face a few times, almost as if to hide his eyes. He was shorter than I thought he would be, but despite being skinny, he was solid and well-built (yes, we bro-hugged).</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Dinner conversation was as diverse as the characters sitting around the tables. The topic of his big comeback came up early, and Whoo Kid started telling him he should &quot;get hip-hop with it&quot; &mdash; cut the hair short, go for a new look and get some bling. Ha. When I told Whoo Kid to show him his big, diamond-encrusted watch, MJ joked, &quot;What is that?&quot; We couldn&#39;t stop laughing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The jokes didn&#39;t stop there. I remember Tyson Beckford standing up and challenging Michael to a dance-off. Michael hit back with, &quot;Let&#39;s see what you got.&quot; Tyson gave it his best with an MJ impression and a moonwalk. Michael laughed, &quot;That&#39;s OK, but that&#39;s easy. Can you do the backwards and sideways moonwalk?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Right in front of us all, he effortlessly broke out a few dance moves (and totally wiped the floor with Tyson). There was a rapturous applause all round. MJ took a small bow. Tyson sat on the floor in submission. It struck me that Jackson was at his most comfortable when performing; and for an obviously shy man, there was a part of him that loved the attention.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was getting late when Jackson said his goodbyes. He said he was going to spend some time with his kids, who were staying next door, and then read a little.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Michael Jackson I met was someone who liked to laugh and joke, but he also seemed happy to forget that he was one of the most famous people in the world and appreciated normality in his life. But that wasn&#39;t just a normal dinner for me; it&#39;s something I&#39;ll be telling my kids about one day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">DJ Whoo Kid, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.shadyville.biz/html/home.php?start_from=6&amp;ucat=&amp;archive=&amp;subaction=&amp;id=&amp;"><span class="cs8567212B">Shadyville article, &ldquo;DJ Whoo Kid Lost in Bahrain&rdquo;</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.mjeol.com/talk/threads/dj-whoo-kid-lost-in-bahrain-march-27-2006.6574/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Next day [after the Grand Prix] the Sheikh&hellip; invited me over to the palace for dinner. John legend, Tyson Beckford, Simon Webb (UK group Blue ), was in there chillin&#39;. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After I chatted with my homies, ...to the right sitting on the couch sippin on lemonade was the King of Motha Fuckin Pop - MICHAEL JACKSON!!!!!!! POW!!!!! $hit was unbelievable. I said wassup to Michael and he gave me a homey hug and a pound with the finger snap. I gave him respect and showed love for all he&#39;s done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He thought I was cool immediately and hanged with me all night. At the royal table he asked me to sit next to him where we spoke about his label deal, 50 Cent, Eminem, and Shakira. We agreed to do my future mixtape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I got him to curse and brought him down to earth and spoke to him like I would speak to my homies around the way. He asked if Eminem really retired and was wondering if 50 Cent would do any collabos with him. I gave him a beat cd with my beats and Alchemist tracks and he went nuts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">John Legend also got Michael Jackson to work with Kanye West so that&#39;s a done deal also. I made the Sheikh and Michael and everyone at the table laugh their hearts out when I gave them my views on where HipHop is going and what&#39;s currently going on the states.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Of course we were clowning about my crazy jokes and how good the lamb ass was tasting. He gave me some weird number (Michael) which reaches him at any time, so now we are official.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1527043/dj-whoo-kid-spends-an-evening-in-bahrain-chillin-with-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">MTV, &ldquo;DJ Whoo Kid Spends An Evening In Bahrain &#39;Chillin&#39; &#39; With Michael Jackson&rdquo;</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">If DJ Whoo Kid could pull off a collaboration between 50 Cent and the deceased Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac, why couldn&#39;t he unite 50 and Michael Jackson on wax?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to the DJ, who recently spent several hours with the King of Pop in Bahrain, it&#39;s a very real possibility.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whoo Kid just came back from spending some time in the Persian Gulf nation with its ruler, Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, the Sheikh&#39;s son, John Legend, model Tyson Beckford and Jackson. Whoo Kid said he and Mike became so tight on the trip that he&#39;s trying to orchestrate a collaboration between 50 and M.J.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I [saw] Michael Jackson sitting by the pool sippin&#39; lemonade,&quot; Whoo Kid recalled of the beginning of his day with the royal family and others in Bahrain. &quot;They didn&#39;t tell me he was going to be there &mdash; I didn&#39;t even expect Michael to be in the country. So I&#39;m like &#39;F---ing Michael Jackson is here, sippin&#39; lemonade!&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I said &#39;What&#39;s up?&#39; to him and acted like I wasn&#39;t groupie-sized. I gave him respect for all the sh-- he did, but in my head I was going crazy. He said, &#39;I&#39;m just chillin&#39; &#39; &mdash; he actually said &#39;chillin&#39;!&#39; F---ed my head up, so I walked away from him. Everybody gave him his respectful space.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During his trip, Whoo Kid also found himself invited to dinner with the sheik, Legend and Jackson. Apparently people were giving Jackson too much space at dinner &mdash; there was an empty seat next to him, which other guests were evidently too intimidated to fill. Finally Jackson, who&#39;d laughed at some of Whoo Kid&#39;s jokes earlier in the day, called the DJ over to sit with him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Mike was like, &#39;Whoo Kid, come sit over here,&#39; the DJ said in a high-pitched voice, mimicking Jackson. &quot;I was like </span><span class="cs43C038A">poinng!</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He was supposed to be there for like 45 minutes; he stayed for five hours. We was talking about Eminem. He was like, &#39;Is Eminem really retired?&#39; I forgot that Eminem totally cremated him in one video [&#39;Lose It&#39;], but [Michael] didn&#39;t even bring it up. Then he started talking about 50.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whoo Kid said that Jackson expressed some interest not only in working with 50 but also Kanye West on a new album. Whoo Kid arranged a phone conversation between Fif and M.J. awhile later.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As for the dinner itself, Whoo Kid said he was acting as a dietary and fashion consultant to Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;They had a whole lamb they brought to the table and Mike was eating some weird vegetables,&quot; Whoo Kid said. &quot;I told Mike, &#39;You better get up on some of this lamb.&#39; I said, &#39;Let me get some of this lamb ass.&#39; The Sheikh was dying [laughing] because I kept saying &#39;lamb ass.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You can&#39;t talk to Mike all fluffy like everyone does,&quot; he continued. &quot;I got him to curse &mdash; he said &#39;sh--.&#39; I told him he needs to cut his hair, get some million-dollar earrings, get a million-dollar watch and take all them spaceship clothes off. He said, &#39;I have to change my whole outlook.&#39; He said he was trying to work out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When his schedule permits, Whoo Kid says he plans to go back to Bahrain and hopefully record with Jackson for one of his mixtapes &mdash; a 50/ Michael Jackson collaboration is tops on his wish list. In the meantime, Whoo Kid has a slew of mixtapes dropping soon: There&#39;s one with Freeway coming (the prince is said to be making an appearance on that one), Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent and new CDs from Mase and Mobb Deep.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Whoo Kid said the next job he wants is to be musical ambassador of Bahrain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
