They, unusually, were not wearing masks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Completing the party was an eight-strong security team, including the minder responsible for pushing Jackson&#39;s chair.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Once inside the Barnes &amp; Noble store, the singer, who turns 50 next month, dispensed with his helper and wheeled himself straight to the children&#39;s book section, where he spent 30 minutes before heading to the music section. An onlooker said: &quot;There were quite a few members of the public in the shop, but no one approached him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;To be honest, he looked a bit weird wheeling himself around covered up in a surgeon&#39;s mask. He was in the shop about two hours in total. WHen they left, the children came out first and he was wheeled out behind them.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...A family friend indicated last night that [the wheelchair] was indeed needed because of a recurring back problem Jackson has had since his performing days.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The star is currently trying to land a residency at one of the big venues in Las Vegas to clear massive debts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/exclusive-michael-jackson-comeback-with-new-317500"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Mirror&rdquo; (July 10, 2008)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson is set to make a comeback with golden oldie boyband New Kids On The Block.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The King of Pop had secret talks about the link-up with the band&#39;s stars at his home in Nevada last week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">New Kids singer Donny Wahlberg, 38, said: &quot;It&#39;s very exciting. It&#39;s one big party and everyone wants to join us.&quot; The pop veterans announced the plan as they celebrated the launch of their first reunion tour in 20 years which starts in September.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">New Kids were the original US boyband and sold 80 million records with hits including Hanging Tough and Right Stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And they are just some of the artists collaborating with Jacko, 49, as he attempts to revive his career following his acquittal three years ago of child abuse charges.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The Bad singer was due to release his much anticipated album this year to coincide with his 50th birthday.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But a source said: &quot;He has been in the studio for months. He wants to create an amazing album and won&#39;t release anything until he is totally satisfied.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He&#39;s a musical genius and record bosses want to leave him to develop his magic. It will be down to him when it is released.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
