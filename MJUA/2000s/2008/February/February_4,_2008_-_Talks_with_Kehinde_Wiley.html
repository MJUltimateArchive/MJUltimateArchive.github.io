The Thriller singer is currently in talks with acclaimed New York artist Kehinde Wiley, whose buyers include Denzel Washington and Sir Elton John. But Wiley - who is famed for his portraits of urban black men in classic Renaissance scenes - thought the planned hook-up was initially a hoax. He says, &quot;Michael Jackson is calling me. We&#39;re discussing exactly what it will involve. He saw my work at the Brooklyn Museum and was taken with it, so he had his people contact me. &quot;I thought it was a joke at first, so I ignored it for the longest time. Then he contacted a friend of mine who&#39;s an actor, so I knew it was for real.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;The Art Newspaper&rdquo; (December 2, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623032805/https://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/The-work-the-King-of-Pop-commissioned-but-never-saw/19815"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kehinde Wiley&rsquo;s monumental commissioned portrait of Michael Jackson is being unveiled this week at Deitch Projects. The 32-year-old US painter was contacted by Jackson in 2008 after the performer saw the artist&rsquo;s work at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. &ldquo;I was receiving messages saying Michael Jackson wants to reach you...and I ignored them because quite honestly I thought it was a prank,&rdquo; said Wiley. After a friend verified the request, Wiley set up a conference call with the performer, which he taped and transcribed. According to the artist: &ldquo;He was also very curious about my personal story and surprisingly he was really knowledgeable about art and art history. I&rsquo;ve done very few commissioned works, so we made arrangements to have certain art historical books sent to him, and he would send me back his preferred pieces.&rdquo; Wiley&rsquo;s studio was in the process of making arrangements for a formal sitting when they received news that the singer had died on 25 June; Wiley never received Jackson&rsquo;s selection of imagery. The portrait is a compilation of six paintings, including works by David and Rubens. When asked why he felt obliged to complete the work, Wiley said: &ldquo;Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t have as much input as I would have hoped for, but I think it&rsquo;s something he would have been proud of. Michael was an extraordinarily talented person with a team who could realise his ideas as much as his performances, and I think that his idea of collaborating with me was something that he really wanted to see through&hellip;I felt a responsibility to him to get it done.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
