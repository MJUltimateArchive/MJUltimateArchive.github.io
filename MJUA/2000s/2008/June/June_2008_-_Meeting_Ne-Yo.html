It feels like you&#39;re complimenting me.&#39; And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.

He said:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When I met Michael my hands were shaking like never before. I was embarrassed because I had hung up on him previously when he called me to work on his album. I thought it was a prank call.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But the great thing is that I get to work with my idol and he is really cool.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But it won&#39;t be easy pleasing the King of Pop as Jacko wants the new album to be even better than Thriller, the biggest seller of all time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Its release has already been delayed as Jacko is not happy yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ne-Yo tells us: &quot;Michael&#39;s new album has to be amazing. I&#39;ve already submitted some songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael is very nervous as he knows he is the underdog and people want him to fail.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There is so much young competition out there.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vibe.com/2010/06/redemption-songs-michael-jackson-pg-4"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (June 21, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200204204503/https://www.vibe.com/2010/06/redemption-songs-michael-jackson-pg-4"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ne-Yo, however, admits he wasn&rsquo;t so gung-ho about working with the iconic entertainer at first. &ldquo;I actually felt bad because before we met I allowed the media to just really paint a picture in my mind of Michael,&rdquo; he says. Yet during their early 2009 meeting held at the Manhattan home of Warner Music Group Chairman and CEO Lyor Cohen, Ne-Yo encountered a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Michael Jackson clad in an all-black suit, tie and big mirror sunglasses. &ldquo;He was like, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s really nice to meet you . . . I&rsquo;m a fan of your music,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ne-Yo says, marveling. &ldquo;He [even sang] one of my songs, &lsquo;Go on Girl.&rsquo; &nbsp;We talked about the album and he told me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to follow any trends. I&rsquo;m not trying to go back in time. I&rsquo;m just trying to do quality music with a melody that&rsquo;s infectious and has a message.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/ne-yo-mulls-over-songs-he-wrote-for-michael-jackson/news-story/7c609ef86dc52676d6c3e1b1548c4597?nk=ddea9e50e6fb07b590be2c122d0e1eed-1580853361"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;The Daily Telegraph&rdquo; (July 28, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200204215827/https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/ne-yo-mulls-over-songs-he-wrote-for-michael-jackson/news-story/7c609ef86dc52676d6c3e1b1548c4597"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite all the controversy surrounding his life, Ne-Yo found the world&#39;s most famous performer to be businesslike and friendly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was normal, as odd as that may sound,&quot; Ne-Yo explained.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I felt quite bad as I&#39;d allowed what the media had done to his name and image to have me thinking, &#39;Ok what&#39;s this about to be? Is this going to be weird?&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But he walked in in a black suit and some sun glasses and was a genuine nice guy. And it wasn&#39;t because he wanted something from me, he just had no reason other than to be a decent guy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;We talked about the state of music, what he liked and didn&#39;t like. One thing that was interesting is that he views music in shapes and colours and that&#39;s how I think.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He told me he admired my music and I could have fainted right there. I was like, &#39;You like my music? You&#39;re the reason I make music&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;So I wanted to bring something good to the table.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ne-Yo set to work on a variety of songs ranging from upbeat dance tracks to heartfelt ballads, sending three or four drafts a week to Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Melodic and meaningful. Those were the two words which kept coming back to me,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael told me the melodies needed to be the ones you heard once and could sing back, and the lyrics needed to have meaning and depth.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He believed what was wrong with a lot of music today is that people aren&#39;t singing about anything.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;If it&#39;s not about a party or sex then it&#39;s about money, and there&#39;s not really much to that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael told me, &#39;I need songs that mean something to somebody and that&#39;s what I need you for&#39;. I was honoured.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Despite writing a number of tracks for Jackson, the album project was put on hold while the singer shifted his attention towards his This Is It world tour, which was scheduled to begin in London in the summer in 2009.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...He hopes one day to be able to pay his respects with the songs he wrote for the great entertainer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Hopefully the songs will see the light of day, it just has to be the right way.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/king-of-pop-michael-jackson-was-going-1097673"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Record&rdquo; (March 16, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140807171443/https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/king-of-pop-michael-jackson-was-going-1097673"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I met Mike in New York.

He was a genuinely nice guy, not because he wanted something from me or wanted me to feel comfortable so I would write songs for him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was talking about music and the love of music. We parted ways after a few hours and I walked away able to say I had sat and had a conversation with a legend.&quot;</span></p></body>
