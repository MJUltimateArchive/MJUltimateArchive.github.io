He looked around the room and waved his arms: &ldquo;This is just temporary. I&rsquo;m building this new place not too far from here. And I want you to do these huge paintings of me and the kids that will hang on all the walls.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Well, how big?&rdquo; I asked. He pointed to a wall about 20 feet away. &ldquo;You can come here and set your stuff up and paint. I want to see you work on the art as you go. I want to document the entire thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He told me how this new place was going to have all his awards and memorabilia for everyone to visit. All the walls he wanted covered in huge oil paintings and murals...He wanted me to think of themes that had a touch of history and sketches that would include him and his children in different settings...Hanging above our heads were a few very large oil paintings, and I said, &ldquo;Michael, we&rsquo;ll do them this big, maybe bigger. I&rsquo;ll see you soon.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
