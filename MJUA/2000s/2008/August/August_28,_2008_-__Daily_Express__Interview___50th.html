How are you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> God bless you. I am fine, thank you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How do you feel turning 50?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, I don&#39;t feel any different. I am fine actually. I am just having a wonderful time. Just relaxing, I am just watching a little James Brown show right now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is that right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I love James Brown, yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> As you look back on 50 years, when do you think you were the happiest?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">The happiest? Oh boy, probably the recording of &quot;Thriller&quot; and the &quot;Off the Wall&quot; albums. That meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world, you know. It was a time I enjoyed it very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What was the most special thing about that experience for you? What moment do you remember most happily?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That I could compose and write music and get to share it with the masses and the people around the world and to have them to receive it so beautifully. I love that. That&#39;s what I spend a lot of time doing. I love composing and writing music and dancing and performing and conceptualizing creatively for visual mediums. I love to create.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson on His Success</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> If you could pick one song, which one song is your greatest achievement?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh boy, that&#39;s a hard one. I love &ldquo;We are the World&rdquo; to &ldquo;Billie Jean,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Thriller,&rdquo; to so many different songs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> As you look back on your career Michael, what would you have done differently?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Differently? Oh boy, that&#39;s a hard one. I am still looking forward to doing a lot of great things, so that&#39;s hard. I think the best is yet to come, in my true humble opinion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is there anything you sacrificed by having this amazing career, 40 years and counting?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> A lot of hard work, discipline and love and learning about the craft and loving it. Time—sacrificing your time and your scheduling. Your childhood giving up your life for the medium.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> If you had it to do over again, would you do it the same way or would you do anything differently?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I think I would, I think I would. It is very much worth it. I have I always loved show business and have always enjoyed making people happy through that medium. I love the celebration of music and dance and art. I just love it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are we going to see you tour any time soon?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&#39;t have any dates set, but we are planning something soon. Yes we are.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Any chance for another CD or recorded music in the near future?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh yes, I am writing all the time. I love composing and the whole thing. But I am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read. I love it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you want your children to know about what your 50 years has been? What will you tell them was the most important lesson you learned in your 50 years?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What dedication and discipline and learning your craft, you know, the rewards it brings, to really know and understand your craft well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You know when most people turn 50, the AARP finds them and sends them an AARP card in the mail. Have you gotten an AARP card in the mail?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Not that I know of! (laugh)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">You never know, they can find you wherever you are!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who do you wish could be here right now as you turn 50 to see what your career has become?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh boy! Probably friends of mine who aren&#39;t alive anymore who I love and were close to me, you know, Fred Astaire. I loved Gene Kelly and I loved James Brown. These are people I feel very close to because it is very much the way I enjoy performing, and giving to the people &nbsp;I give 101 percent when I go on stage, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Who do you see now who reminds you the most of you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh boy, wow. I see artists that kind of I have been a great influence on their work and I think they are doing a wonderful job. Some of the younger newer artists &nbsp;I think Chris Brown is doing a wonderful job and Timberlake and all these wonderful new artists. I really admire what they are doing. Very happy for them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How do you plan to celebrate your 50th birthday?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, I&#39;ll just have a little cake with my children and we&#39;ll probably watch some cartoons.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is there anything you are hoping to get as a present?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Hmmm. Love and joy, peace for the world, that&#39;s what I want. Peace for the world and love, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do your children understand what a big star you are? Have they listened to your music and do they enjoy it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">They do. I try my best not to show them my stuff and play them a lot of it, because I know they will grow up to hear it. I don&#39;t want them to get too caught up. They see it when we go around the world. We go out and it&#39;s not so easy, you know, the fans and the love and the adoration. But they ask me a lot of questions and I answer their questions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Would you like them to have the same sort of upbringing you had in terms of getting into show business at an early age? Or do you want to say whoa, take a minute, enjoy your childhood?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible. I really do. I let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things. I think that comes naturally. I want them to get to do the kind of things I didn&#39;t get to do. So I fill them with a lot of enjoyment that way, a lot of amusement, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It must mean a lot to you to have your kids do the things you couldn&#39;t do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, I get pretty emotional when I see them having a wonderful time. When they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy, it makes me emotional, cause I see they are having a real good time, you know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson on Turning 50</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What kind of shape are you in at 50? Can you still do all the moves and hit all the notes that we remember?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> More! I can do more, because I am expanding a lot of the avenues that I was holding back and I am just going to share more of the gifts that God has given me and just let it all hang out. People see some of the things I do and say, &ldquo;Why don&#39;t you show this to the world, people don&#39;t know you do these things!&rdquo; And maybe I will.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Does 50 feel like a big number to you? How old to do you feel you are?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I feel very wise and sage, but at the same time very young, so it&#39;s hard to say.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You have a lot of fans out there who would like to come out with some way to celebrate your birthday. What would you like them to do, to commemorate your 50th?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, to think about our planet seriously. I mean, how to make it a better planet. The global warming issue is a concern to me very much. Just make the world a better, happier place. It&#39;s our home. I&#39;d like to see us do a better job of taking care of it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is that because you are a father and you look at your kids and worry about what we are leaving for them when we go away?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That, and I have always felt compassion for the planet. Sometime I just start to get emotional. I cry because I can almost feel the pain in the air. So it makes me—I put it in words and in song and in dance. I think that is what artistry is.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Connelly:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Will you take the day off (for your birthday) or will you be working like you normally do on your music or dance?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Jackson:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I will be working, love to work. I don&#39;t take too much time off. </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/58961/Jacko-turns-50-The-look-of-an-older-star"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; (August 29, 2008)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But just look at how the years have changed him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">True, he looks spookily young with his slimline figure, chiselled jaw and thick mane of glossy black hair.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In fact, even he had trouble remembering his age last night as he celebrated in Las Vegas ahead of his birthday today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I still look OK, don&rsquo;t I, for 40?&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When reminded that he was actually about to turn 50, Jackson is said to have given a sad half smile and replied: &ldquo;It all went by so fast. I wish I could do it all over again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...The star celebrated at his fav&shy;ourite restaurant, Planet Holly&shy;wood at Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas, where he has lived for the past two years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today the multi-million-selling artist will host an intimate gath&shy;ering with his children Prince Michael Jackson Jr, 11, Paris Jackson, 10, and Prince Michael Jackson &ldquo;Blanket&rdquo; II, seven.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has struggled with the idea of turning 50, those close to him have said. &ldquo;He believes it is the logical cut-off point for someone who has made their career in pop,&rdquo; said a friend of the star last year.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He never wanted to be the guy dancing on stage at 50.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just last week he told one interviewer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. I&rsquo;ve got nothing left to give.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I just want to be left alone. Is that so bad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The star is said to be &pound;170 million in debt, but millions of fans are crying out for him to make a return. And there is some hope.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Acrobatic dance troupe Cirque du Soleil is apparently keen to make a dance show based around his tracks, as they did with The Beatles&rsquo; songbook two years ago.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has also been seen popping into a recording studio with Black Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am, and is said to have signed a deal with music impresario Simon Fuller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His appeal certainly endures. &nbsp;US rap star Akon has said of him: &ldquo;Some artists think regional, some think national, others international.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He thinks planets. He&rsquo;s on another level.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
