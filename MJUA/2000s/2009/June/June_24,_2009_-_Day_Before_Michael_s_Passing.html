Around the &quot;This Is It&quot; time, we were sort of just wondering, as the preparations continued and then, of course, the tragedy happened, do you remember, or do you feel comfortable sharing what was the last thing Michael said to you?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He said&mdash;at the end of rehearsal, after we finished, and then we almost finished the first run. That was the first run-through, full run-through we were making without stopping, so to speak. We had stopped a couple of times, but for the most part, we had just almost through first runs when it got so late, that we had to break it for them till the next day to finish up the last two or three songs, whatever. And then he talked to everyone, but he&#39;s grabbing [everybody together] and we stood there, and he said, &quot;Thank you, Foot, you sound great. You sound amazing. It&#39;s going to be so great. Isn&#39;t it gonna be great?&quot; And I said, &quot;Yeah, this is gonna be great&quot;, and he said, &quot;So exciting, huh?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s gonna be exciting.&quot; He said, &quot;You&#39;re doing a great job.&quot; I said, &quot;Thank you, Michael.&quot; He said, &quot;For what? I love having you here. It&#39;s gonna be great! We&#39;ll have a great time and everything. You did a great job today and I can&#39;t wait &#39;til tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait &#39;til tomorrow&quot; He&#39;s like excited, enthusiastic. &quot;I can&#39;t wait &#39;til tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait &#39;til tomorrow. We&#39;ll go through the rest and our first run-through, so I&#39;ll see you tomorrow, okay? Get some rest, we&#39;ll be back at it tomorrow&quot; And I say, &quot;Ok&quot;. Then he hugged me, and then I said, &quot;Ok, alright, bye Michael&quot;. He said, &quot;Bye Foot&quot;. And he&#39;s laughing, smiling like a little boy, and then we hugged, and that was around one o&#39;clock in the morning, and I had no clue that that was the last hug I&#39;d get from him, that last time I&#39;d hear him talk, see him. It&#39;s just different looking back on it. Very different, very difficult. Just think about that, you don&#39;t know, in people&#39;s lives. That&#39;s why you gotta treat everybody with love and respect every time you see them. Every time you&#39;re around them, every time you approach somebody, every time you address somebody, because there&#39;s somebody you care about or you know, or whatever&mdash;especially those are you related to you. You don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the last time you&#39;re gonna see them, breathing, alive, and animated. I look at that now, and I see&mdash;but I&#39;m thankful. I&#39;ve always shared my love with Michael and told him I love him, and hugged him, and he&#39;d laugh and smile about the old tours. And we always talked about that and the kids, and he met my kids and stuff, and he asked me about &#39;em. Something like, &quot;Remember the tours? Remember the &#39;Destiny&#39; tour.&quot; He&#39;s like, reminiscing all that kind of stuff. &quot;Are you still smoking?&quot; I had never smoked in my life. He said, &quot;You don&#39;t smoke?&quot; I said, &quot;No&quot;. He said, &quot;Good, good. Don&#39;t start, don&#39;t start.&quot; [MJCast laughs] &quot;Do you drink alcohol?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t drink. I never did. You know, Michael&quot;. &quot;Oh, good. Don&#39;t start, don&#39;t start.&quot; We&#39;d talk about personal things like that because we have a relationship in a personal way too, not that I was there every day with him at his house or around him. No, it wasn&#39;t that. When he needed me for a tour, he&#39;d call me, but we started back where we left off. And some personal love relationship between two brothers, and it just was spiritual that way. We didn&#39;t have to say much, we just knew, and we would connect. And so that&#39;s what basically happened and that was that. So I was left with the results of what became, what it is. Extremely difficult, extremely difficult.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Travis Payne, choreographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.cyinterview.com/2011/02/travis-payne-lives-to-dance-choreographer-with-michael-jackson-16-years-now-on-cbs-show-with-paula-abdul/"><span class="cs8567212B">CYInterview, Chris Yandek interview article (February 5, 2011) (Full audio link available as well)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The last time I saw Michael was June 24th. The evening, we had finished rehearsal and we had completed the show, all the beats were there and we were waiting on a few sort of components that would be used for the set and things like that and we were just about to leave the following week for London for a series of rehearsals there before opening. The evening before his passing, I saw him and we had a rehearsal and he was leaving. Just in true Michael Jackson fashion, as he&rsquo;s leaving, we pass each other and always it was just a regular occurrence. You pass him in the hall or you pass him walking and you say, &lsquo;I love you.&rsquo; Most times he&rsquo;ll say I love you first. That was the exchange, always. So we did that. I said, ok, see you tomorrow. He said, ok, see you at two o&rsquo;clock and that was our time. We always met for This Is It and often times for other things. There was something about that time that was good and that was really it. Last thing he said to me was I love you. So I&rsquo;m grateful for that and that was the last thing I said to him. So I&rsquo;ll remember that forever as one of my sort of favorite moments that was the last thing we said to each other and we meant it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank DiLeo, ex-manager, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://youtu.be/E7NqrDLdN0A"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Raffles Entertainment&rdquo; interview</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808154931/http://www.positivelymichael.com/forums/showthread.php?37-Transcript-of-Raffles-van-Exel-interviewing-Frank-DiLeo"><span class="cs8567212B">archived transcript</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Okay. Marlon Jackson went on the record on CNN&rsquo;s Roland Martin and he said Michael was not feeling well early in the morning of June the 25th and late at night on the 24th. If that is true, can you tell us what was wrong with Michael? Did Michael request to go to the hospital in the early morning hours?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No and I don&rsquo;t think that Marlon spoke to him on the morning of the 25th and I am not sure he spoke to him the night of the 24th.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When we left the Staples Center and we said goodbye. Michael was very happy. I just solidified his Halloween special that he wanted from the time I got here with NBC. We laid out what we wanted to do with the film Ghosts, and what his participation was and he was acceptive of that. He was extremely happy. He went home. Whatever happened at home in the privacy I can&rsquo;t account for. Michael Jackson was an adult. When we left Staples Center or wherever we were rehearsing I&rsquo;d go to my residence, and he&rsquo;d go to his. You know the man he wanted some privacy. He wanted his free time to be his free time. I couldn&rsquo;t and nobody involved in this group of people was a hall monitor. You know we spent hours with him at the (1g) but once we went home &ndash; unless he called you at 2 in the morning to ask you a question, that was about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But I&rsquo;m not sure if Marlon spoke to him that night because we didn&rsquo;t leave the Staples Center until about midnight so&hellip;and I know he didn&rsquo;t speak to him anymore.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Miko Brando, friend/bodyguard, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/26/lkl.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Larry King Live&rdquo; (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407003754/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0906/26/lkl.01.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">KING: We&#39;re not going to know.

How was he?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BRANDO: We were — yes, we were at Staples Center rehearsing and — until about midnight or 12:30 that night. And he was fine. He was dancing. He was singing. He was looking over some technical stuff, some videos that he was preparing to do for the flat screen and behind the stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I saw him eating.

The singer was in rehearsals at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, running through a full slate of songs from his upcoming 50-concert London event flanked by friends and colleagues. He marveled at the major set pieces that had finally been installed in the rehearsal space. &quot;He was just glowing, and you could see it, that he was finally seeing it all come together,&quot; says Dorian Holley, the vocal director for Jackson&#39;s upcoming tour. &quot;Up until Wednesday, it had always been [just a concept], but that last day you could see it in him, that he was seeing the show finally come together for the first time. It was a big moment.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csAEFEEABF">Holley says he left rehearsals just before midnight on the night of June 24, as Jackson headed off to attend yet more meetings. About 12 hours later, a 911 call would be placed from Jackson&#39;s home in Holmby Hills, reporting urgently that &quot;he&#39;s not breathing ... He&#39;s not responding to CPR, anything.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csAEFEEABF">The pop icon had seemed different during these rehearsals &mdash; not ailing by any means, but perhaps more contemplative &mdash; says Holley, who has coached Jackson on solo tours since 1987. In preparing for previous tours, Holley said auditions for backup singers and other performing roles would usually be held via videotape, and it wouldn&#39;t be all that uncommon for the two to speak directly only two or three times over the span of a year. But for &quot;This Is It,&quot; the London concerts scheduled to begin in July, Jackson was much more present and available, attending auditions and eagerly talking with everyone in the crew about the larger mission behind the tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csAEFEEABF">&quot;It almost sounds crazy to say that the show wasn&#39;t about him, but ... he&#39;d put it in perspective all the time, saying, &#39;This is what we&#39;re here for, to spread a message of love and taking care of the planet, that we want people to understand it&#39;s very, very dear and not to take it for granted,&#39;&quot; Holley tells TIME.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csAEFEEABF">Until the last hour of rehearsals, Jackson maintained a ferocious, perfectionist pace, says Holley, who, after decades working with the singer, says he was still astonished by his vocal and physical prowess. Some in the public questioned whether Jackson, at 50, would still be able to command a stage, and recent reports published Sunday in Britain&#39;s </span><span class="cs4E18DE79">Daily Mail</span><span class="csAEFEEABF"> said that Jackson had been too feeble to dance, sing or, at times, even speak in the weeks leading up to his death. But, Holley &mdash; despite his own early concerns about a lack of rehearsal time leading up to the first London shows in July &mdash; says the star&#39;s presence and energy during his final week was unequivocal. &quot;He&#39;d take the stage with this group of dancers, all in their 20s, but you couldn&#39;t take your eyes off him ... Many of his songs have six or seven parts, and he would often come over if we were missing an important note in our mix, and he would sing through all the parts rapid-fire to show us what he wanted. We would just sit there with our jaws open &mdash; it was awesome,&quot; Holley says. &quot;He could still do everything ... The only difference now was that he would sometimes talk about how it made him sore.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csAEFEEABF">&quot;This time around, we had the technology to isolate just his microphone and listen to his singing separate from everything else. I had no idea what a genius he was. The way he&#39;s able to use his voice as a percussion instrument, lyricist, jazz singer all at the same time. I&#39;m sure as people mine his works in years to come, they&#39;re going to discover how much is there,&quot; he says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csAEFEEABF">...Jackson had been preparing to take the world back, Holley says, and during the singer&#39;s final night, he finally knew he was ready. &quot;You would think that, on the one hand, the world has kind of beaten him up, and you could forgive him for having some trepidation and fear. But he didn&#39;t have any of that,&quot; says Holley. &quot;Words fail to describe what people would have seen with the tour. I couldn&#39;t even imagine until last week when it became physically apparent [on the set]. He was ready to show the world, and I so wish there could have been just one concert so the world would have seen.&quot;</span></p></body>
