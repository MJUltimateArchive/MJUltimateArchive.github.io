Where were you both?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;ll start with you, Lavelle, when you heard that Michael had died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I was at home in my bedroom watching CNN and I heard Michael Jackson went to the hospital with a heart attack. And I thought, OK. That&#39;s -- kept watching and it kept getting worse and worse. And I just thought this really either is a really bad publicity stunt or something is desperately wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And you knew that Michael, you know, he could do publicity stunts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Of course. He&#39;s a show man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I mean, he&#39;d been in wheelchairs before to create an impression that he was somehow in a terrible state.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And then the next -- because he always had this thing, make the public go low in expectation and then dazzle them with the high. This was</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Absolutely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: P.T. Barnum. That&#39;s what you do as a showman. Yes, you build it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: A part of you is thinking --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: -- Is this another Michael stunt?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes. And I really was hoping for that. I kept hoping, and then it got worse. And then when they finally said, dead, of course, even that I didn&#39;t believe until it stayed there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: You saw that on CNN?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes. It all went up from heart attack to something happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Not breathing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Not breathing, and then dead. And I was like, OK, just wait a few more minutes. And then it didn&#39;t go away. And I thought this is really crazy. I called his assistant. And she said, it&#39;s a madhouse around here. And I thought, OK, this is the real deal. I just went numb. I remember being numb for days and days. I couldn&#39;t cry. I think anger. Just every emotion except I couldn&#39;t cry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I didn&#39;t cry until I did the TV shows with Jermaine in London. &quot;Move Like Michael Jackson,&quot; and I was doing a little outtake like, you know, how you do for the show reading something that said Michael Jackson was -- I kept saying Michael Jackson is -- and they&#39;re like, you have to say was. I said, I got it this time. Michael Jackson is -- OK. Finally when I got was, it was over. It was over.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And for you? Where were you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: I was at the Staples Center. I was getting ready for that day&#39;s rehearsal. I had a list of changes to do from the night before, instructions from Michael. And when they said that the first thing I thought was he wants two more weeks to rehearse, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And then when they finally announced that he was D-E-A-D, I still -- I went back to my computer. I made all the changes from the night before, because I was stunned. I said, well, no, he might come back, you know. And later that day, I just -- I finally had to ask somebody what to do? And he said pack your stuff up, you know? And that was -- it was dreadful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For anything, I feel for his children, you know? He was the greatest dad in the world. Those were the loves of his life. You know?

I got a call from a fan, they had just served us some lunch, I was with a friend, and uh the fan said, &ldquo;Do you know there&rsquo;s an ambulance in front of Michael&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; I said &rdquo;No&rdquo;. She said, &ldquo;Well, you know there&rsquo;s an ambulance there&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;Okay, let me get off, I&rsquo;m going to call Michael&rsquo;s Assistant&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I called Brother Michael. I said, &ldquo;Is there an ambulance in front on the house?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;. He said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going from my apartment to the house. There seems to be a problem.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;But the Doctor&rsquo;s with him.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m on my way to the house.&rdquo; I had to go to my room to get my card .ticket and I had shorts on, I wanted to put a pair of pants on. As I&rsquo;m walking I called Randy Phillips. I said &ldquo;Randy, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on but there&rsquo;s an ambulance at Michael&rsquo;s house. I know you live in Beverly Hills; go there right now, I&rsquo;m on my way, but I want you, you can get there quicker than me.&rdquo; and I hung up. He was at the cleaners, he went right to Michael&rsquo;s house. I got in my car and came out; you know Michael lives up in there in Hollywood or whatever it&rsquo;s called. I was driven to his house on many occasions, he would send somebody to pick me up. Sometimes I would follow somebody; I know how to get back. I might had driven there twice on my own. I made the wrong turn&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: All those streets there look alike.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: They all look alike, so I came from the back. So it took me maybe a extra minute, you know, to find it. Instead of going the right way I was like a street off. So I got to there and the gates were wide open and the guards were out there, and I said &ldquo;Where the ambulance?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;They took Michael to the hospital.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know which hospital. In my mind I thought it was Cedar-Sinai.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well I said, &ldquo;I better call Randy.&rdquo; So I call Randy and I said, &ldquo;Did you get to the house?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m following the ambulance.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Where are we going? To Cedar&rsquo;s?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;No, were going to UCLA.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo; And again, I didn&rsquo;t really know where that was. Trent called me, Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s driver; I&rsquo;m sorry, Mrs. Jackson called me. She said, &ldquo;I heard they took my son to the hospital. &ldquo;I said, &ldquo;Katherine, they did. Should I come?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on yet. Just give me a minute, and I&rsquo;ll call you back.&rdquo; I hung up.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">3 minutes later, as I&rsquo;m still driving, her driver called, &ldquo;Frank, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know Trent, I don&rsquo;t know, but tell Katherine to come on, bring her down here, were going to UCLA, it&rsquo;s better that she comes&rdquo; because I still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. I get to the hospital, I see all the security. Hospital security&rsquo;s got everything blocked off, roped off, nobody&rsquo;s getting in. Randy&rsquo;s waiting for me in the emergency room area where you sit. I come in and I greet him, &ldquo;What going on?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo; They let us back because they knew who we were. Everyone else had to hold on.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">We got to the little room, you know, we heard them working on him, we thought he was alive&hellip;and&hellip;the rest happened. But Mrs. Jackson didn&rsquo;t get there for like 40 minutes because they were coming from the valley.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had a wheelchair, a Cardiologist and a social worker waiting for her so that she could &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t want to walk it &ndash; I know that she had a bad heart. I wanted that cardiologist to oversee her.</span></p></body>
