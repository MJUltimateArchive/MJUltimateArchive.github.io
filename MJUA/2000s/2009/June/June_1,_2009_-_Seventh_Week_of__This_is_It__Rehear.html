The singer, 50, posed for snaps outside the dance studio where he is rehearsing for his summer tour. He was later snapped alongside son Prince Michael II, six, emerging from a Beverly Hills skin clinic wearing the T-shirt.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/michael-jacksons-children-unmasked-for-the-first-398051"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Daily Mirror&rdquo; (June 5, 2009)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here&#39;s real piece of pop history &ndash; as one of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s three children is unmasked for the first time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s head might be partly hidden under his brolly.
