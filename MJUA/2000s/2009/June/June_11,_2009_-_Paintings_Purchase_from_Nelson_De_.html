I had the honor of meeting him and delivering the artwork to his home shortly before his death. He was a childhood idol of mine and an entertainer who broke ground and set new standards for those to come. He was in a league of his own though and really, in a world of his own. He was mysterious and talented and the world constantly wanted to know who the man behind the mask was. I can tell you..he was a kind, gentle, soft-spoken man who did me the honor of loving my art and I hope my creativity brought him joy. I am deeply saddened and shocked by the timing and irony of the recent events which have taken place. My life has been changed forever. You can&#39;t meet someone like that... an enigma, a piece of history, an idol and not be changed. The saddest part is that Michael Jackson had just started a &quot;relationship&quot; with my art and myself and who knows what would have come of it? Now we&#39;ll never know, but I consider myself lucky for having the brief moments I had to meet a legend and place my paintings on his walls.</span></p></body>
