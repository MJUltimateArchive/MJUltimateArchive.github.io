I thought it was going to be for the tour he was going to do. For the next month or two, he would call, saying, &lsquo;Michael Jackson says he&rsquo;s going to call you.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At the end of April, another Michael, Michael Jackson&rsquo;s personal assistant, called me and asked me to come the next day at 10 a.m. and asked me the make and model of my car. I drove to the Holmby Hills home. I drove up to the front door, and was met by an assistant who told me to go inside. I was met there by a woman dressed like a housekeeper, but with a white turban on her head. She said, &lsquo;Michael Jackson will be with you shortly.&rsquo; About two minutes later, he came down the stairs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was reluctant to shake his hand because I had heard that he was concerned about germs, but he immediately stuck his hand out and gave me a very firm handshake. He was very skinny, but not the least bit frail. He was wearing a suit and a hat. He was going to rehearsal later for the tour. He said, &lsquo;You look familiar.&rsquo; I told him a long time ago I worked on a TV tribute to Sammy Davis, Jr. at Shrine Auditorium [that he had participated in]. I told him I had met him briefly there.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I never forget a face.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He told me, &lsquo;I have three projects going on simultaneously.&rsquo; One was the tour that the whole world knew about. The other two I believe no one knew about. One was to be an album of pop songs. Then he said, &lsquo;The other one is that I want to record an album of classical music&rsquo; &mdash; what he called classical music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said he listened to ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">classical music all the time; it was his absolute favorite. I was impressed with the pieces he mentioned: Aaron Copland&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Rodeo, Fanfare for the Common Man</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Lincoln Portrait</span><span class="csD5D7D290">; Leonard Bernstein&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">West Side Story</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. I mentioned Bernstein&#39;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">On the Waterfront</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Then Michael mentioned that he loved Elmer Bernstein&#39;s film music, too, and he specifically mentioned </span><span class="cs43C038A">To Kill a Mockingbird</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I realized that almost all the classical pieces he mentioned are childlike, very simple and pretty, like Prokofiev&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Peter and the Wolf</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> and Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Nutcracker</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Suite. He also mentioned Debussy several times, specifically </span><span class="cs43C038A">Arabesque</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [No. 1] and </span><span class="cs43C038A">Clair de lune</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. He was very soft-spoken when were talking about music, but when he got animated about something, he was very changed. When he mentioned how he loved Elmer Bernstein, and I said I liked the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Magnificent Seven</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> score, Michael started singing the theme very loudly, almost screaming it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m making a CD.&rsquo; Then his son, Prince Michael, came in, and Michael asked him to find a CD player. Paris found one and brought it in with Prince. Michael played the CD. It was very pretty music. He said, &lsquo;But a section is missing.&rsquo; He played a second piece. And he said, &lsquo;But a section is missing, too. But I can hum it to you.&rsquo; I asked if there was a piano in the house, and he said there was one in the pool house. We headed out there, but Michael stopped when he saw the dog was outside, soaking wet from being in the pool. He didn&#39;t want us to get splattered. It was kind of funny. Michael got another assistant to hold the dog while we went to his pool house.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I sat at the piano and Michael hummed the missing part of one of the pieces. I had taken a little digital recorder with me and asked if I could record him. He was in perfect pitch. I tried to figure out chords to go with it as he hummed. He said, &lsquo;Your instincts are totally right about the chords.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We talked about classical music some more. I played some Debussy pieces. Michael seemed very happy and I think he felt very comfortable with me. He mentioned Leonard Bernstein again, and I played some of </span><span class="cs43C038A">West Side Story</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. He told me he had met Bernstein once and that Bernstein had said he was a big fan of Michael&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Back in the house, whenever he&rsquo;d go from room to room, you&rsquo;d hear, &lsquo;I love you, Daddy.&rsquo; &lsquo;I love you, Paris.&rsquo; They all seemed pretty normal and happy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael was very anxious to get the pieces orchestrated and record the music with a big orchestra. I suggested we record it at the Fox, Sony or Warner Brothers lot. I asked if he could have someone call me to discuss the budget and he said he would take care of it. When I left there were several fans outside the gate.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[Later] I talked to Michael on the phone. He asked me how the project was going and I said I was waiting to hear from someone so we could set the deal. I suggested we could record the music in London while he was doing the show there. He liked the idea. He again brought up </span><span class="cs43C038A">Arabesque</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I laid the music all out on my computer and started on the orchestrations. Finally, a week before Michael died, his manager, Frank Dileo, called and asked me for an email with the budget and an electronic mock-up of the music, the costs of orchestration.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now I have no idea what&rsquo;s going to happen with this. I&rsquo;m hoping the family will do something to get this done. I will not bring it up [with them] until after what I think is an appropriate time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">My guess is that each piece would be seven to ten minutes long. [Each one] is more substantial than a song. It&rsquo;s very pretty music. One piece had an Irish quality about it. I suggested that we could use a Celtic harp. The pieces sound like pretty film score music, with very traditional harmony, and definitely very strong melodies. One of them was a little John Barry-ish, like in </span><span class="cs43C038A">Out of Africa</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> -- that kind of John Barry score. I could hear [in my head] sweeping strings and French horns in unison.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I told Michael I was going to use one of Leonard Bernstein&rsquo;s batons I had bought at auction when we did the recording. I knew he would have gotten a big kick out of that. I guess I still will use that baton if I ever get to conduct the music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (June 21, 2010) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100625004849/http://www.vibe.com/content/redemption-songs-michael-jacksons-final-effort-save-his-legacy"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Composer David Michael Frank was equally impressed with the power of Jackson&rsquo;s conviction. The Baltimore native planned to collaborate on an unfinished classical album with Jackson just months before his death. In late April 2009, Frank was invited to the singer&rsquo;s Holmby Hills home to discuss the compositions. Michael revealed his plans for additional projects to Frank that evening: a tour and the album of pop music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He played me some pieces and we talked about the orchestration,&rdquo; Frank says. &ldquo;They were very simple, pretty and childlike.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
