That&#39;s what makes me so angry when I see these things that are happening in our world. That every second I hear the size of a football field is torn down in the Amazon. I mean, that kind of stuff really bothers me. That&#39;s why I write these kinds of songs. You know, to give some sense of awareness and awakening and hope to people. I love... I love the planet. I love trees. I have this thing for trees. And the colours and the changing of leaves. I loove it! And I respect those kinds of things.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I really feel that nature is trying so hard to compensate for man&#39;s mismanagement of the planet. &lsquo;Cause the planet is sick. Like a fever. If we don&#39;t fix is now, it is at the point of no return. This is our last chance to fix this problem that we have. It is like a runaway train. When the time is come, this is it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">People are always saying, &quot;Oh,&quot; they think, &quot;They&#39;ll take care of it.&quot; &quot;The Government&#39;ll do...&quot; &quot;Done with that...&quot; &quot;They&#39;ll...&quot; They who?? It starts with us. It&#39;s US! Or else it&#39;ll never be done. We have four years to get it right. After that it would be irreversible.

But it&rsquo;s an adventure; it&rsquo;s a great adventure; there is nothing to be nervous about. They just want wonderful experiences. We wanna save this earth. We wanna take them places they&rsquo;ve never been before. We wanna show them things like they&rsquo;ve never seen before. So give me your all. I love you all and we are family. Please, know that: we are a family. We have to bring love back into the world, to remind the world that love is important, loving - to love each other. We are all one. Messaging: &lsquo;Take care of the planet&rsquo;. We have four years to get it right. Or else it&rsquo;s irreversible damage we&rsquo;ve done. So, we have an important message to give. Okay?...

And the busier you can stay in times of grief, I have learned, in a way, the better it is for you. Sometimes it just means you&#39;re postponing mourning, or your real grief, until later when things kinda quiet down, but I think it does sort of help you. And so while everybody&#39;s out there, being sad at Michael&#39;s memorial, I&#39;m back behind the curtain, running all the audio and stuff, but I was happy to do it. And then, after that, I took my family on a--just a little, sort of a camping vacation. We have a little RV, and we took it up to Northern California, we went to Yosemite, which is one of the most beautiful places on Earth, and then we went to Lake Tahoe, and that&#39;s another beautiful lake, and some nice camping areas. And I remember I started getting phone calls from a friend of mine, Bill (William) Sheppell [Jr.], who was our front of house mixer for that show. An amazing, amazing mixer. It would&#39;ve been one of the best sounding live shows you&#39;ve ever heard. It was that good. And he said, &quot;Hey, where are you?&quot; And I go, &quot;I&#39;m up in Northern California.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;When are you coming home?&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I don&#39;t know. Why? What&#39;s important?&quot; And he goes, &quot;Well, we&#39;ve been looking at all the video and we&#39;ve been listening to all the multitracks that we were making&quot;--and the multitracks were being made, by the way, just so you can do what&#39;s called a virtual sound check, so when the band&#39;s not there, you can run the audio back through the mixer, and you can practice mixing it, make the drums sounds better... add different EQs and compressors to things so you&#39;re even more ready for the next rehearsal with the live band. So, he says, &quot;We think we have enough here to do some sort of a documentary&quot;. I went, &quot;What?&quot; And I was like in shock. And so I said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be home in four or five days if that works for everybody.&quot; And it did, and so I got home, and I remember driving down to AEG&#39;s office downtown, and that&#39;s where they had like all these little Pro Tools systems set up and video editing systems set up, and wow, the first time I sat down and saw Michael in those raw rehearsals, I just started crying. And it was hard, but in the long run, it made me so happy &#39;cause I felt I was working on another Michael Jackson project, and it&#39;s as though Michael was there. And you&#39;re seeing him everyday, and you&#39;re hearing his voice, listening to him talk, and it was really like a journey of joy and grief at the same time. And I remember when we finally finished that project--it was really hard to finish, because they kept changing days on us and different performances, and so you had to grab the audio from that day and try to blend it with the audio from 3 days earlier where it sounded a little bit different, so it was a lot of work. But when we finally got finished mixing the whole thing, and we played it for everybody that worked on the movie--they had like a family and friends day, then I remember them going, &quot;Well, Michael Prince, I think today was your last day. It sounds great, you&#39;re done.&quot;. And I just remember feeling that same, lost sadness that I felt the same day that Michael passed away, just packing up my stuff for the second time. Calling the guy with the truck, having him come pick it up, and having it delivered at my house. To wind the clock back to June 25, I just remember--I had notes from the night of June 24 from speaking to Michael about things that needed to be changed on three or four songs, and even after Michael--it was announced that he had passed away, I still felt I had to finish at least all the things that i had promised I would do, and so I did all that. And now it&#39;s like two or three in the afternoon, and I&#39;m just walking around in a daze like everybody else, and I finally went to the production office and I talked to the head of production--really great man named Bugsy--and I said, &quot;Bugsy, I don&#39;t know what to do&quot;. And I meant it. I was like, probably in shock. And he looked up at me and he goes, &quot;You need to go and pack up your equipment, and you need to go home&quot;. And, I mean, I really had to hear somebody just say it to me like that, in order for me to go and pack up my equipment, unplug it, and go home. And that was rough. And it was sort of the same thing at the end of &quot;This Is It&quot;, but at least now we had something that I think really showed how hard Michael, the dancers, the band, how hard everybody worked, and how it started, and where we ended up, and Michael still--for those of us that have worked with him before and knew him well, Michael was dancing at like 25% of what he was capable of, he was singing at 15% of what he was capable of, because for Michael, those were just camera-blocking, trying to show the lighting guy where he was gonna stand, looking at video and saying, &quot;Ok, that needs to have more blue in it.&quot; I mean, Michael--I always thought of the tour as Michael&#39;s sandbox, that was a giant toy for Michael, and he understood every nook and cranny of that stage, he understood lighting. I love that one little scene in the movie &quot;This Is It&quot; where Kenny says something to him, like &quot;Michael, we should start the next song&quot; and Michael goes, &quot;I&#39;m sizzling&quot;. And Michael knew that there were these sizzle moments and if you guys have ever seen like him play or videos, Michael knows there&#39;s times in the show where he could stand there for 3 minutes and just wriggle a shoulder, and the audience will go crazy for 30 seconds. So Michael was starting to, in his head, build all those things into the show, and it was gonna be unbelievably magical, that show, and hopefully we captured a little bit of it in the movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was a very important project to come out, and it definitely helped myself and a lot of other fans when we saw it. It was incredible to watch.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I&#39;m glad to hear that, and I know--it was good for even--my wife loved Michael, she came with me to the ranch many times, she was on tour with us for weeks at a time with the kids. The kids loved Michael, they loved watching that. In fact, I know my wife came with me to the premiere--I don&#39;t remember if we were able to bring the children or not. They loved Michael to death, and so did my wife.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was that your decision to use the demo vocals rather than the live vocals [in &quot;This Is It&quot;] to show it as a more completed thing?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it was at least 50% of my decision. I don&#39;t want to take credit, because it was a committee. My job was to get it to fit into there, but I remember saying, &quot;Look&quot;--and the other thing--I&#39;ll say this as a sort of interrupting myself. I went through great pains on that movie. If they were going to use any part of a vocal from a previous tour that was directly from an album, I went through there and worked hard to get some of the little idiosyncratic sounds that you know you would never hear live, and remove those from the vocal. And I did that, you know. And in fact, you know, a lot of artists that are out there these days, that are using a pre-recorded vocal don&#39;t use one from the album. They go into a studio and they re-sing a new one, because they want it to be a little bit different. Michael just never had the time, or took the time, to do that. We did talk to him about it for the &quot;This Is It Tour&quot;, and we did set up a little studio, and the idea was to have some fresh, non-album versions of the songs, and we actually did start. I&#39;ve got some of his vocals, a little bit of &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;, a little bit of &quot;Startin&#39; Something&quot; and then he and I had many nights, long talks in his dressing room, just the two of us, and he over a period of a week or two, expressed to me that he really didn&#39;t want to do that anymore. He said, &quot;If we are gonna do it, I want just you and I, pick a studio, nobody else is there, and we&#39;ll do it.&quot; And then a week later, he called me into his dressing room, he goes, &quot;You know what? I&#39;d like to just sing live more, and if we have to use something, we&#39;ll use what we used in the past&quot;, and I already made in my mind if that was gonna happen, I was gonna take out any little foot clicks or little extra things that you normally wouldn&#39;t hear live. And I said, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s your show, you&#39;re the boss. It&#39;s your decision, I stand by any decision you make.&quot;, so that&#39;s when we stopped trying to record new vocals for that tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Are you able to shed some light on some of the other ideas that were considered or slated for inclusion, which we didn&#39;t see in the film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I know &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;... The mashup between &quot;Will You Be There&quot; and it might have been &quot;Heal the World&quot;--oh my God, that was one of the hardest things I ever did, because you got two songs that have hundreds of tracks of audio in them and you&#39;re trying to marry them without blowing out your system, and you have to figure out which bar you&#39;re gonna switch to the other song, and try to get the tempos close and stuff--that was almost a one-week project in itself. I think that&#39;s the one that I&#39;m thinking about... The main thing is, some of those songs, we had not yet rehearsed. And because of that, there was no video of them, and there was no audio of them. I kind of had a feeling we hadn&#39;t rehearsed &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot; yet. &nbsp;Michael was having a tough time cutting songs because by now, there were so many of them. And you had new songs he wanted to add, you had songs that did not get played on the HIStory Tour that they said, &quot;Well gosh, you didn&#39;t do that on the HIStory Tour, why don&#39;t you put that back in the show?&quot; Like Dirty Diana was going to go into the show. And so I remember Kenny Ortega would say, &quot;Michael, you need to think about this, we need to cut another two or three songs&quot; and Michael, he goes, &quot;These are like my kids! I can&#39;t just cut these songs out&quot;, so that was one of the hardest things for Michael to do was to figure out what songs he was gonna have to just give the axe to. That was rough. We still hadn&#39;t gotten the show as short as it needed to be. When I say &quot;short&quot;, Michael was doing a really long show, but he had so much material. I do have--I don&#39;t know if I have it in this computer. I might have the file setlist... Here, &quot;MJ UK Master&quot;... It says &quot;6/25/09&quot;, let&#39;s open that one up. Yeah, we were gonna start with &quot;Startin&#39; Something&quot;, and then &quot;Don&#39;t Stop &#39;Til You Get Enough&quot;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Michael was going to perform that song in full in the show?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, I wanna say &quot;full&quot;, but it might&#39;ve been an abbreviated version. A lot of these songs we were maybe gonna do like one verse and a chorus and a dance section and a chorus, rather than do the entire song... and then &quot;Rock With You&quot;, and then we were going to &quot;Drill&quot;. &quot;Drill&quot; is that opening section to &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot;... &quot;Drill&quot;, and into an abbreviated version of &quot;They Don&#39;t Care About Us&quot;, and then &quot;Human Nature&quot;, and then &quot;Stranger in Moscow&quot;, and then &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, and then &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;--the slow version, much like it is in the film, if I remember correctly--and then &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;... then [next to &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;] it says &quot;DNU&quot; which means &quot;Do Not Use&quot;, so it might have been one that I had programmed and then we decided it was gonna be in the set, so don&#39;t quote me on that-- and then &quot;I Just Can&#39;t Stop Loving You&quot;, and then &quot;Dangerous&quot;, and then &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, and then &quot;Beat It&quot;, and then &quot;Thriller&quot;, which was gonna have that cool ending on it, you know the [hums instrumental of &quot;Threatened&quot;]... I love that part. And then &quot;Earth Song&quot;, and then--oh yeah, this was the big thing, it was &quot;We Are the World and &quot;Heal the World&quot;, getting those two songs married to each other, and then &quot;Black or White&quot;, and then &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, and then &quot;Will You Be There&quot; and it says, &quot;DNU&quot;, so maybe, as of the 25th of June, we were not doing that song. &#39;Cause some of them, we learned more songs than we could actually fit into the show. And then &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, which as far as I know--yeah, &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; was gonna be the encore, the final song. And that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So no plans for any new music during the show, is that right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You know what, I think what was gonna happen is, once we got this much learned, Michael told me that once we got to the UK, we were gonna--as soon as we started rehearsing, we stopped working on all new material. I had been going to his house and working with Michael, some days with a guy named Ron Feemster, also known as &quot;Neff U&quot; on new stuff... But some of the stuff &quot;Neff U&quot; was working on was just rehashing some of the stuff that Brad and Michael had worked on, just with different piano sounds or different drum sounds, so not all of them were like new, new stuff, but we did have some new stuff. Probably have 20 titles on a hard drive of stuff that Michael and &quot;Neff U&quot; were working on. And then Michael said once we got to the UK and got settled in, I was gonna bring all my gear over to his house, and on our days off, and when he had the energy and I did, then we were gonna continue working on new songs. And this is something that, when he first said it to me, I thought, &quot;What is he talking about? And then I realized within about two minutes that it was genius. He goes, &quot;I&#39;m not gonna release albums anymore. We&#39;re just gonna put out a single every couple of months.&quot; Because we all come from the land of albums, you know what I mean? So at first, when he said that, I thought, &quot;Why would he say that?&quot; And then, literally, within a few minutes, I realized it would solve so many things. A) You&#39;re already touring, so you&#39;ve got this buzz going on because you&#39;re playing--and it wasn&#39;t just gonna be London, it was gonna be all over the world--and you release a single, so you&#39;re only trying to sell one song. It&#39;s a whole new world now, and he realized that. It was all digital, it can be a worldwide release [with] the stroke of a pen. And then what he could do is, after you do about eight or ten singles over the period, of course, of, let&#39;s say, a year. You do two new songs, and repackage it as an album. And I think that was genius, I really do, now that I think about it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Were you surprised by the decision to embark on the &quot;This Is It&quot; concerts, and what did you think Michael&#39;s attitude towards those concerts was?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was surprised... a few weeks before he went and made the announcement, he called me on the phone and we talked for about an hour and a half that day. I was sitting in the very same room I&#39;m sitting and talking to you right now. And he said, almost out of the blue, he goes, &quot;You know, don&#39;t you remember how awesome it is to be on stage in front of, like, 50 thousand people&quot; And I said, &quot;Yeah, I do.&quot; And then I went, &quot;Why is he saying this?&quot; And then he starts talking about playing and touring, and getting that feeling. And I go, &quot;Wow, he&#39;s leading up to something&quot;. And it was interesting, because he made it very clear--we talked about a lot of other things too--but he made it very clear that he was thinking about touring again. And I was really happy to hear that, primarily because there were so many new artists that, in my mind, were pretty much copying him, wearing the hat, and having four dancers, or six, or eight, and sort of kinda doing MJ--don&#39;t need to mention any names, but there were a lot of &#39;em, and I thought, &quot;Wow, this&#39;ll be awesome. &#39;Cause he&#39;ll come back and show them who&#39;s boss&quot; and I had no idea what the plan was. This was before he moved down here to L.A., so he was still in Vegas at the time, and I was going back and forth to Vegas, so this was just one of those calls. I figured it was going to be a little short call of him saying, &quot;Hey, I need you to come back up to Vegas&quot;. And it was interesting in that phone call, he talked about all the positives and all the things he loved about touring and then he said something very cryptic, he says, &quot;The only thing I don&#39;t like about touring is all the doctors&quot; And I think I&#39;ll just leave it at that for now, there&#39;s more to it, but it was something I was unaware of, but I am now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And would you say his level of enthusiasm was the same throughout, or did it seem to diminish as the concerts got closer?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It did not diminish, &#39;cause I would have regular, like little, just one-on-one sessions with him in his dressing room, and I did feel that he was trying to do too much at once, and after the movie was put together, I learned he was even doing more than I thought he was. I didn&#39;t know he was at these sessions where they were making the videos that were gonna be on the big high-definition screen. We were gonna have the first 3D screen of all time. It was amazing. That show, between trying to be--remember Michael was an A-personality, he was involved in every aspect of that, from the songs to the music, the choreography, arrangements of everything, all the effects. If there was gonna be an elevator, a crystal ball, whatever--those were all things that he would be involved in the decision-making process. So between music, dancing, all the curating of the new video material, and then approving of it, and final edits and stuff. He was working a lot. And I remember in his dressing room one time, talking to him, and I just sat down. I go, &quot;You miss your kids, don&#39;t you?&quot; And he says, &quot;Yeah&quot;. And I said--&#39;cause we were like two weeks away from going to the UK. I said, &quot;Well, you know what, this is the hard part&quot;. I didn&#39;t need to tell him that, he knew that. But I said, &quot;You know, once we get there, we&#39;re gonna be doing three shows a week&quot;. I said, &quot;You&#39;re gonna have so much more time with your kids&quot;. And then he got his nice smile on his face and I think it was just--I think he definitely was getting more nervous as we got closer, because, remember, he hadn&#39;t toured really since &#39;97, right? So that&#39;s twelve years. I don&#39;t think he had any doubts, but I just think he felt pressure in that--knowing Michael and how much attention to detail he paid to things, everything, I know he would have loved it, had we had an extra two weeks, or an extra four weeks to get ready.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You have taken credit in the past for the postponement of the first few shows to buy some extra rehearsal time. So what was the thought process behind that, how did that come about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well that was pretty much me looking at the calendar. I went into the production office, and they had a calendar, and it said these days we&#39;re at a place called Center Stage, and then on these days we go to the Forum, and then on these days, we go to Staples Center to rehearse, and then we fly over to the UK, and on these days we&#39;re gonna rehearse at Wembley Arena, and then all of a sudden, it says on this day it&#39;s our first show at the O2. And so I went, &quot;What?&quot; Because normally, you want two, three, four, five days of full production rehearsals, meaning you run the show--costumes, lighting, everything in the venue, especially if you&#39;re gonna be in a venue on and off for six months. So I went and got Kenny Ortega, and I say, &quot;Hey Kenny, can you come look at this with me?&quot; And so we just walk in and I go, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it make sense if we had some actual rehearsals at the O2 before the show?&quot; And like, the lightbulb went off. And, of course, I&#39;m just Michael Prince, I&#39;m really nobody in the grand scheme of things and Kenny, as soon as he saw that, he looked at me, and he went over and he talked to Paul Gongaware and anybody else from AEG that was there, and he goes, &quot;Guys, we have to have at least [three or four] days of rehearsal at the O2&quot; and the only way to do it was to move everything later by three or four days, or something like that. So I felt bad later on because I heard stories about people that had tickets for opening night and now they had it--it got bumped to blah-blah, and I&#39;m like, &quot;Damn&quot;, but you don&#39;t take somebody like Michael Jackson or any major artist, and spend all this time getting ready for a show, and not at least do two nights or three nights in that room, and get that sounds perfect for that room. You just don&#39;t move in there, set up, and play a show in front of people. That&#39;s just--I don&#39;t know who thought of that schedule, but it felt like somebody didn&#39;t really look at the big picture.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And when we were in Cologne, you actually said that, when you first heard on June 25, that something had happened involving Michael, your first thought was that it was a stunt or a ploy to get even more rehearsal time. Would you mind talking us through June 25 through your eyes?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Sure. In fact, it&#39;s interesting, I had to transfer a Jackson 5 tape that a friend of mine got through an auction. We had no idea what was on there. So I went over to a place that does transfers, and I want to say &quot;transfers&quot;. They take tape and they bake them if they&#39;re really old and they say, &quot;It&#39;s from 1975&quot;, and so we had bake it, and then we had to transfer it into Pro Tools. And this was the friend that called me on the morning of the 25th while I&#39;m driving to the Staples Center, and he called me and said, &quot;Michael, I don&#39;t know if you know this or not, but they just announced on TMZ that MJ was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. And I went, &quot;What?&quot; So I turned on the news, and I thanked him for calling me, and what went through my mind immediately, and if you&#39;ve worked around Michael for as many years as I had, you would&#39;ve thought probably the same thing. That it was like that very first show in 1995. He was dehydrated, he was tired, but at the same time, he knew he needed two more weeks, or wanted two more weeks. So my very first thought was, &quot;Wow, maybe we&#39;re gonna have two more weeks of rehearsals&quot;. And I kept driving, I got down to the Staples Center, and there hadn&#39;t been any sort of announcement yet, other than what we had already heard. And so we all--Kenny had us all stand on the floor of the Staples Center, and we all held hands, and he told us what he knew so far, and that was that Michael had been taken to the hospital. And then one of the guys who worked in the crew, his dad was a preacher, so he said a beautiful prayer, and then we all said a prayer, and then we all went back to work. And he says, &quot;Ok everybody, go back to work, and as soon as we hear something, we&#39;ll make an announcement.&quot; And, I want to say, it was probably a half-hour later or something like that, that I guess they heard--&#39;cause I didn&#39;t want to watch TV, I was--I had my headphones on, I was working on Pro Tools and they said, &quot;Ok, everybody, come back out to the floor of the Staples Center. We have an announcement to make&quot;. And that&#39;s when he had us all hold hands again, and they made the announcement that Michael had passed away. And wow. It was just like, everybody just started crying. And a lot of hugging, a lot of, &quot;I can&#39;t believe this is happening&quot;, and I really felt--I mean, obviously you feel the worst for Michael&#39;s kids, but when I saw the young dancers, who they hired, who had--this was gonna be--this was the biggest thing to even be on the stage with Michael Jackson. It just took the wind out of everybody, everybody. There were people that went in different rooms, dressing rooms, and lit candles. And many just told stories about Michael. And it was pretty amazing, I kinda walked in and out of several of the rooms, just to sort of see how everybody was doing and, like I said, I think I was in shock too, &#39;cause they finally had to tell me to pack my stuff up and drive home... You kinda don&#39;t want to believe it, even after it&#39;s on the news. You keep saying, &quot;Well no, he&#39;s just gonna--he&#39;s gonna come back here later on today or tomorrow. He&#39;s got to&quot;...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When would you say you properly grieved?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, it was in stages, because we started working on Michael&#39;s memorial fairly quickly it seemed like. And we had all these amazing artists come down. I remember the rehearsal the day before, Stevie Wonder, when he did his song, he was crying while he was singing it. You&#39;re just realizing how many incredible people thought the world of Michael Jackson and loved him. And that helped a little bit. And then taking my family to a few beautiful spots in California, and just getting out in nature helped a little bit. And then working on &quot;This Is It&quot;, at first, was very difficult, because it felt like Michael was alive again and then having a lot of 12-hour days kinda helped, but I think it really--I don&#39;t know, things come and go, I had to sort of grief again, but probably a different stage, like I said, when we got done working on the movie &quot;This Is It&quot;. Then, thank God I had, at the time, a lovely wife and two children to sort of lean on. It&#39;s also was special to me that they knew him and they loved him too, so it wasn&#39;t like they had never met him, and I have to go, &quot;Oh, he was this great person, I really miss him&quot;. I mean, they knew him, and they missed him too. And that helped a lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How much of a surprise [were] all of [the AEG emails] to you to find out after the fact?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> It was a big surprise, because I didn&#39;t know about the emails. On the 24th, he and I at that meeting. During the day, and the reason we got such a late start rehearsing is Michael sat there, and he sat with the video crew that had finally finished all the edits that he wanted, and he watched all the videos for the whole show, top to bottom. And signed off on them. So much stuff was moving forward that day, all the videos were finally put to bed, all the final music arrangements were done--until after that show, I had a few more to do for the next day on the 25th, and then on the 25th, we were gonna have this, pretty much, the end-all-be-all meeting about singing, although that could&#39;ve changed a little bit over the next two weeks. The 24th was a real milestone day, as far as getting that show from 70% to 95%.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Were there conversations going on about concerns of Michael&#39;s health, or were you kind of kept separate from all of that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was kept separate from that. And I did notice Michael looked a little thinner the last couple weeks. But, I also remember talking to Michael at the ranch five years earlier, and he told me that the lighter he is, the easier it is for him to dance. And he told me that he was sick and tired of drinking these food supplements--I forget what it&#39;s called, but you drink it to help keep weight on, &#39;cause Michael had a naturally fast metabolism. And he goes, &quot;I&#39;m not drinking these things anymore&quot;, and this was just, not even on the road. This was just at his house. He ate fairly healthy most of the time. Like salad, chicken, and stuff like that. Like I said, he told me the less he weighed, the easier it was for him to dance. I didn&#39;t ever see a weak, tired, out-of-person on stage. I saw someone who was holding back. I saw someone who was holding back both dancing and singing. And I knew why, he already knew the songs, &quot;I didn&#39;t need to sing them until it was time&quot;. So all that stuff was a surprise to me, the times i met him in his dressing room, he was very coherent. We had very normal conversations, and, like I said, his passing was just a huge shock and surprise. Looking back, I mean, come on--there is no person on Earth that could ever think that they could have general anesthesia every night for the next x amount of years. That&#39;s just not rational thought to me. I can only think that he must have really felt that doctors were a next level up, as far as intelligence and how they can keep you healthy and alive--and my wife&#39;s father was a doctor. They&#39;re just regular people. That&#39;s why they call it a practicing medicine... You never get perfect at it. I guess it&#39;s my own belief that maybe he could have medicine like that every night, but wow... I wish somebody would&#39;ve just said, &quot;Michael, you can&#39;t do this. You could do this once a month maybe.&quot;, but there&#39;s so many other ways to treat sleep problems. Believe me, I have sleep problems. When Michael told me had sleep problems in 2009, I didn&#39;t think much of it, because I&#39;ve had sleep problems since I was in high school, and some nights I don&#39;t sleep at all. But I&#39;ll try to sleep again the next day, but I had no idea he had ever taken general anesthesia to help sleep. So I was very surprised and shocked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you, at any time, reevaluate your involvement in the film and come to have any second thoughts about whether you&#39;d maybe been helping to improve the image of a company that didn&#39;t necessarily deserve the effort?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I have never read those emails, I&#39;ve never really heard about those emails. I didn&#39;t watch the trial, I didn&#39;t want to watch the trial, because, to me, there was only one thing that mattered, and that was Michael had passed away. And the trial wasn&#39;t gonna bring him back. Did I think the doctor was guilty? Of course I did. But I didn&#39;t watch the trial--even the things that you&#39;re mentioning now about Michael being slapped, I don&#39;t know anything about that, I&#39;ve never read that. And part of me doesn&#39;t want to know anything about that. I do think that this was something that, financially, Michael desperately needed, but also, that AEG realize that, as a company--and I heard some of their three to five year plan they had for Michael. There were some amazing places he was going to play, amazing events that he was gonna be performing at, and it was all jaw-dropping, and it was gonna put Michael back on the map, and it was also gonna really help AEG as well. But look at AEG now, I mean, they do Coachella, and Stagecoach, the Rolling Stones... I think they were sort of already there already, that&#39;s why they had the ability to keep writing checks for all the things Michael wanted. I didn&#39;t know until after everything was all over, I thought Michael bought that house that he was living in, I thought he bought it. I didn&#39;t realize AEG was renting it for him. &#39;Cause that&#39;s none of my business, it really isn&#39;t. And I would never ask Michael that. I assumed that he bought that house, or that he was renting it. I had no idea AEG was--I knew AEG was paying for rehearsals and dancers and salaries and equipment, and if Michael wanted a giant chandelier coming down, AEG paid for that. But those are all the start-up costs you normally have for a big tour. And that&#39;s why they hoped this was gonna go three to five years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You mentioned a moment ago the five-year plan. What was it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, the tour was supposed to last from three to five years, depending on how long Michael wanted to do it, but it went way, way beyond London. And I&#39;ve probably forgotten more than I could ever remember, but it involved--they had already talked to the people about having him play at the Super Bowl. They&#39;d already mentioned a place in Japan, where he was gonna play, a place, actually, in Australia. It was all rattled off to me, this was while we were still rehearsing. I&#39;m just going like, &quot;Wow, this is awesome.&quot; And, of course, we didn&#39;t even get to play one show, which, like I said, to me, that&#39;s not the saddest--the saddest thing is that the kids lost their father. That&#39;s the saddest thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> There&#39;s just one more thing I&#39;d like to ask about the &quot;This Is It Tour&quot;, and it&#39;s to do with the song &quot;Dangerous&quot;. That&#39;s a song that didn&#39;t make it onto the Blu-Ray. I think it was Travis Payne who said that that&#39;s because Michael wouldn&#39;t have been happy with his own routine potentially with that performance. Would you be able to explain to us like how different was that song to earlier versions? How had it evolved? &#39;Cause it had evolved a lot over the years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Prince:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I would have to actually listen to the audio again and see how much that changed, but it was just gonna be bigger and better. And that was one of the songs that we were getting new changes and making edits literally two to three times a week. And I actually think I got the final version of Dangerous the night of the 24th, and I don&#39;t think we actually rehearsed it that often because it was still a work-in-progress... The dancers had a separate room, and I had an assistant named Mike McKnight, and--amazing guy. He was working with the dancers, &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t be in two places at one time. &#39;Cause normally I&#39;d work with the dancers and chop up stuff, and Michael would usually--well Travis would work there with the dancers, and then when he thought he had a version ready to present to Michael, they would have Michael come back into there, and show it to Michael, and then Michael would run through it. And I&#39;m not really sure--I know we played the song with the band a few times, but the arrangement kept changing just a little bit, like I said, two to three times a week. So it wasn&#39;t something that I think would&#39;ve been ready for that film. And remember, that film--that was just supposed to be outtakes for the eventual DVD that was gonna be filmed the last two nights in London. The last two nights at the O2 were gonna be filmed, and all the material you see on that DVD was probably gonna be cut down to about 15 or 20 minutes of outtakes and behind-the-scenes for the concert &quot;This Is It&quot;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember the speech he gave when we were getting ready to start &quot;This Is It&quot;. This was a speech just to me, but he said, he goes, &quot;I can spend the rest of my life doing my biggest hits. I don&#39;t wanna do that. I wanna keep writing great songs that are relevant, that people will love, and keep re-inventing who I am&quot;. So he didn&#39;t want to just sit on his haunches and just do Michael Jackson&#39;s greatest hits, and I think that&#39;s one of the reasons he didn&#39;t do the Vegas thing. &#39;Cause the whole time we were there, he kept telling me, he kept getting offer after offer after offer from different casinos to build him anything he wanted to perform in, and just get him to stay in Vegas for the rest of his life. He just wasn&#39;t ready to do that yet.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Mo Pleasure, keyboardist, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://lasvegasblackimage.com/2009/12/this-is-it-band-discusses-its-final-days-with-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">Black Image interview</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: What was the experience like, being part of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s finale, &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; &mdash; the concert production and the movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pleasure: It was an honor and a tremendous experience. The movie brought back so many emotions in so many different ways. The first time I saw the movie, it was like seeing family again &mdash; because the band, dancers and crew were all there at the movie premiere. I laughed and I cried, and cried some more. They did a great job with the movie.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: What was it like being in such a big concert production &mdash; with so many months of rehearsing &mdash; and not being able to show it to the world?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pleasure: It was devastating. I played at Michael&rsquo;s memorial service, and it was extremely hard. I have such a wide range of emotions. There have been other scheduled tributes to Michael that never happened and a lot of other disappointments. There have been more disappointments than (just) the one that happened on June 25. So many disappointments that affect the way I feed my family. There are a lot of things, but I am so happy that there is a movie that actually caught us doing what we do. It got to the point where we forgot that the cameras were there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Why were the concert rehearsals being recorded?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pleasure: From my understanding, it was something that Michael requested for whatever reason he had. Possibly for a documentary called &ldquo;The Making of the This Is It Tour&rdquo; &mdash; I really don&rsquo;t know. But, whatever the reason was, Michael went into a partnership agreement with AEG Productions. AEG decided to do the movie, with the consent of the family, (using) the rehearsal footage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: In the movie, Michael laughed at a comment about &ldquo;booty&rdquo; made by musical director Michael Bearden. What was that about?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pleasure: Well, &ldquo;booty&rdquo; is what we refer to in music as the lower end, or the bottom end, of the kick drum or bass. Musicians might say, &ldquo;Put some booty on it.&rdquo; Obviously, Michael had never heard that term before, and started laughing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bashiri Johnson, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;My situation was really unique because I was the first live percussionist to be in the Michael Jackson band--other than The Jackson 5 where Randy was playing congas, there wasn&#39;t really a live percussionist&quot;, says Bashiri. &quot;I had to come in and I think the reason why people call me is that I&#39;m able to perform the sounds on the record and make them sound a lot more contemporary. I had to play those sounds and parts and make them sound live and fresh.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Take, for example, &#39;Billie Jean&#39;&quot;, he says. &quot;Paulino Da Costa played cabasa on that. I could have maybe just played a little cabasa sample, but that wouldn&#39;t be big and when you&#39;re performing with Michael Jackson, you want your presentation to be big, to be powerful. I took the original sample and I augmented it with some of my stuff electronically and gave it a wider breadth. When you hear it in the movie, it sounds big and full. It doesn&#39;t sound any different from the record really, it sounds like a cabasa, but it sounds like a bigger, meatier, punchier cabasa that can reach the back row. That&#39;s what I do. When I get called, people know I&#39;ll come in and I&#39;ll reach that person all the way up in the rafters.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bashiri remembers Michael being very involved in the music during rehearsals, never just leaving matters in the hands of his Musical Director Michael Bearden.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He spent a lot of time talking to the guitarists about the sound on &#39;Black or White&#39;&quot;, remembers Bashiri. &quot;There was a little chord movement that Michael Bearden was doing a little differently where Michael Jackson corrected him: &quot;&#39;No, you went there too quickly!&#39; So, Michael was there the whole time letting us know what things were supposed to sound like, when things were supposed to happen, what&#39;s supposed to be in, what&#39;s supposed to be out.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">According to Bashiri, the rehearsal process was intense. The musicians would be called for four o&#39;clock in the afternoon and start running songs around six o&#39;clock for production.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Kenny Ortega would come up and he would explain to us what was going to be happening during this particular song, production-wise&quot;, he says. &quot;He would say, &#39;A fascimile of the Earth is going to descend from the ceiling, there are going to be angels floating around or a spider will come out.&#39; He would say all these things and we&#39;d all go, &#39;Yeah, right, sure.&#39; Then when we got into real production rehearsals, it would actually be that--this huge Earth would come down from the ceiling, and a huge spider would come out and walk across the stage.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Bearden, music director, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://lasvegasblackimage.com/2009/12/this-is-it-band-discusses-its-final-days-with-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Las Vegas Black Image&rdquo; interview (December 1, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181216181019/http://lasvegasblackimage.com/2009/12/this-is-it-band-discusses-its-final-days-with-michael-jackson/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Michael also made comments in the movie about the sound hurting his ears. What was he referring to?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: Yes, he was referring to the inner-ear sound monitors that were in his ears. Michael had never used them before, and they are an exact science, and you have to work on them to get the sound right. We wanted to work with Michael with them, but he just came into rehearsal and put them in his ear and we started rehearsing. That is why he said in the movie that he felt like the sound was like a fist in his ear, because it blocks off all other sound unless it&rsquo;s adjusted right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Michael seemed so concerned about the band and crew&rsquo;s feelings before giving any criticism.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: Yes, that is true and it&rsquo;s in the movie. That is how he was &mdash; all love.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: What are you doing now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: I multitask. I have my own company, and I do movie soundtracks and productions and I have my own CD coming out.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Has working with the &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; band and being in the movie opened any other doors of opportunity for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: Absolutely. Opportunities in both the music industry and in business have been offered to me. Right now, things are really busy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: It has been reported that the &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; movie grossed more than $100 million in the first week. Are you and the other band members receiving any money from the movie?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: I can&rsquo;t really comment on that. It is a great question, but there was a contract that was done and it was handled correctly. I have no complaints.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Had Michael Jackson lived, where would the tour be right now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: We would be in Europe doing three shows a week. I know that there was a lot of speculation about Michael being able to do 50 shows, and I have no doubt that he would have completed all 50 concert dates.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Did Michael Jackson seem sickly during rehearsals?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: No, not at all. They had special dietitians on the set, but he was fine. He was a man of 49 years, almost 50 years old, doing all of those dance moves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Did the band pray before every rehearsal?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: In the movie, when we all gathered in a circle, that was a special occasion when Michael wanted to say thank you to all of us. He knew that we were all dedicated to do the greatest show on earth. I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough how hard we all worked. We would see the sun come up, and when I would finally go home, I would see my neighbors headed out to their jobs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: What was your final memory of Michael before he died?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: The day before he died, I remember having a great connection with him. He looked me in my eyes and shook my hand with great force. He was not at all weak. We both looked each other in the eyes and I said how glad I was to be there. He said, &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo; I will never forget that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Did Michael ever bring his children to rehearsals?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: Michael was doing full dance rehearsals that were five and six hours a day, and then come and rehearse with the band. He never brought his children to the rehearsals, because he had very serious ethics about rehearsals. He just wanted people there that were involved with the production.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: In the movie, when Michael does his tribute to earth, he mentions that we only have four years to get it right. What did he mean by that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: I haven&rsquo;t researched it, but I interpreted it as we only have four years left before the damage to earth is irreversible. We might only have three years now, but even if we try to help the earth after three years, it might be too late.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Was it the entire band&rsquo;s understanding, and Michael&rsquo;s, that there would be 50 concert dates?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: Yes. The dates were all going to be in London for two years with a plan to bring the concert to the United States.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Black Image: Who named the tour, &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden: Michael is the one who named the tour. It can be taken so many ways. I understood it to be a great show that he showed his children. The song, &ldquo;This Is It,&rdquo; sounds like he is singing to children. He was leaving a legacy.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.vibe.com/2010/06/redemption-songs-michael-jackson-pg-4"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (June 21, 2010)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200204204503/https://www.vibe.com/2010/06/redemption-songs-michael-jackson-pg-4"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;To see the passion in Michael&rsquo;s eyes made me confident that this was for real,&rdquo; says keyboardist and musical director Michael Bearden, who worked out This Is It&rsquo;s set-list during a series of spirited auditions at CenterStaging. At first Jackson seemed focused on performing the gargantuan pop hits that helped him sell some 750 million albums worldwide, but Bearden had other ideas. &nbsp;&ldquo;MJ and Kenny Ortega came in while I was playing &lsquo;I Can&rsquo;t Help It,&rsquo;&rdquo; he says of the jazzy Stevie Wonder-penned cut from </span><span class="cs43C038A">Off The Wall</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. &ldquo;Michael just smiled and looked at me like he was surprised and said, &lsquo;You like that song?&rsquo;&rdquo; Bearden launched into a medley of Michael&rsquo;s funkiest material, from &ldquo;Working Day and Night&rdquo; to &ldquo;Can You Feel It&rdquo; by The Jacksons. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the South Side of Chicago, so I knew all that stuff,&rdquo; he says, laughing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Bearden didn&rsquo;t want the crossover behemoth to obscure the fact that Michael was a rhythm and blues man at heart. Any question of forgetting his roots was erased by Michael&rsquo;s brief run-through of The Jacksons&rsquo; 1978 disco floor burner &ldquo;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),&rdquo; featured in the behind-the-scenes footage of </span><span class="cs43C038A">This Is It</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. Contrary to popular belief, Jackson&rsquo;s colleagues say he was in good health. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hearing all these rumors about him being frail and in a wheelchair,&rdquo; Bearden says. &ldquo;But he was upright. And he sounded like the Michael Jackson from back in the day . . . all the power, all the ad-libs, all the inflection with no problem.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Travis Payne, choreographer, &ldquo;Vibe&rdquo; (June 21, 2010) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100625004849/http://www.vibe.com/content/redemption-songs-michael-jacksons-final-effort-save-his-legacy"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It was such a huge undertaking,&rdquo; recalls choreographer Travis Payne of the intense preparation for the 50-show spectacle. &ldquo;So I asked MJ, &lsquo;Do you ever get nervous?&rsquo; And he goes, &lsquo;No . . . this is what we do. You have to leave it all on the stage. If I get nervous, it radiates through the group.

That was a big deal to him. I&rsquo;d show him something I&rsquo;d think was amazing and he would say, &lsquo;Okay, I see where you are going, but we should do this to it or try it like this or take away the leg part.&rsquo; He was always in control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://cyinterview.com/travis-payne-lives-to-dance-choreographer-with-michael-jackson-16-years-now-on-cbs-show-with-paula-abdul/"><span class="cs8567212B">Chris Yandek interview (February 5, 2011)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181217151856/https://cyinterview.com/travis-payne-lives-to-dance-choreographer-with-michael-jackson-16-years-now-on-cbs-show-with-paula-abdul/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Owing to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s tragic passing, fans would never get to see his </span><span class="cs43C038A">This Is It</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> show.

Everyone from Diana Ross to Mariah Carey was going to sing and perform with Michael during the show&rsquo;s run at the O2 Arena in London.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Travis confided to me after the interview that it was going to be the greatest show ever and there are many surprises that were planned that people still don&rsquo;t know about.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Though still early in her career, Jackson had let Travis know that he wanted to even invite Lady Gaga to perform with him. Who knows what the performance would&rsquo;ve been like, but it would have aligned, in some way, the King of Pop and the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Poker Face</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> singer.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was working on This Is It with Michael Jackson and we were creating a shortlist of artists we were gonna invite to appear with Michael on the show at several events and different occasions. After we had gotten to the end of the list, we had of course Janet and Diana Ross and Justin Timberlake and Usher and Missy Elliot and Teddy Riley, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and a lot of people that he loved, artists. We got to the end of the list and I said, is there anybody else you add and he said, yeah. I said, who? Lady Gaga. I go really? He said, yeah, she&rsquo;s cool and I said, ok.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">At that time, I wasn&rsquo;t familiar. I think Gaga had put out </span><span class="cs43C038A">Poker Face</span><span class="csD5D7D290">. It was still early on at her success. And I said really? He said, yeah, she&rsquo;s cool. You gotta get into her. And I said, ok. So that was really my sort of introduction to her. As you know, we wouldn&rsquo;t get to do This Is It, but shortly after we completed all of the memorial services for Michael, I got a call from Lady Gaga. We had a discussion about her show and it just blew me away. I told her the story about how Michael had said that he wanted to invite her to sing with him in his show and of course she was so moved and humbled and then that&rsquo;s how I met her. She just sort of called out of the blue.

He was always thinking like a great producer, too. He was telling us we needed to design a way to maximize the audience that could see him with less travel time for him and the company. So he proposed setting up the show for two or three months in a single location, make that a portal, as opposed to being on a plane, jumping from city to city, twice a week.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And why Kuala Lumpur, the most populous city in Malaysia, and other locations on Jackson&#39;s portal wish list in India and the Republic of Sri Lanka?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Just as he did on the HIStory tour, when we went to Northern Africa, the idea was to set up in a region that was struggling and could really benefit economically from having us there. Everything Michael did came from a place of love and the commitment to do good. That&#39;s the way he was with us working on the show - you felt like you were being nurtured, constantly stimulated and encouraged to come up with the best ideas in a collective situation.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;And that&#39;s where his art was coming from,&quot; added Payne. &quot;His concept was not just to make a great song you could dance to. His way was to reel you in and get your attention, so then you&#39;d get the deep message. That was the science to it. That&#39;s why his music transcended generations, appealed to little children, older people, everyone. And hopefully, people who see the Cirque show are now feeling all that, too. That was our intent.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking to movies online shortly after Michael passed away, Payne talked about a new section in the show he&rsquo;d rehearsed for THIS IS IT.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I loved them all.

I heard that he was very frail, that the stuff you didn&#39;t see in the movie, he was fainting. He was always kind of faint.

He&#39;d show up on dance days. I showed up on music days. And I just had the feeling, Michael is getting ready for his close up. He just started looking better. You could tell he was -- his energy was going up. And then in 2009, extremely excited. You know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He gave us a speech about how important this was to him.

We&#39;re going to add those to the show. And I really have never seen him that energized before. That in the moment before, right up until the last night when I gave him a hug and he gave me a hug, you know. And he felt strong.

He and I about that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">How this was the hard part, rehearsing is the hard part. You know, four, five, six nights a week. Doing videos during the day. Once we got to the U.K., once we started the shows, that was going to be almost a vacation. Truly, you know. I don&#39;t want to say that because they were going to pay me, but I mean, honestly, it would have been.

I remember that happening. I think, you know, Michael, you&#39;re talking about a guy who was not as young as he used to be. 50 shows is pretty demanding, even if you&#39;re only doing 2, 3 shows a week.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Absolutely.

It was the best concert I ever saw.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Men, he was just honored that people wanted to see so as much as maybe 34 or the 50 shows were like, oh man, this is going to be crazy. The smile on his face showed me that he felt so honored that people really wanted to see him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Let me ask you a different question. Did you ever see him taking drugs of any kind?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Never.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: He seems to have been a very closed world. What we&#39;re hearing from all this trial that&#39;s happened and from interviews of people involved is that there were two Michaels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">There was the Michael that people thought they knew and there was the guy who chronic pain from when he had the terrible Pepsi accident and then to counter this, the terrible insomnia he used to get, mixed with the pressure and everything else, and so he got more and more into sleeping medication ending up with Demerol for the pain and the Propofol for sleeping.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I mean, you put it all together and he was leading two lives. I mean, there was a night time Michael Jackson that you guys I assume didn&#39;t see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Did not see. And honestly, most of the time, when we were with him, I don&#39;t think that night time Michael Jackson was around because he had the kids around. We were at the ranch. We were at a hotel almost like a vacation and we&#39;re working on new songs. And there was no pressure on him. He didn&#39;t have to get up the next day if he didn&#39;t want to. He didn&#39;t have to perform the next day. I think that pressure comes in to play when there&#39;s a show. You know? When there&#39;s a huge tour.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Exactly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Let&#39;s take a little break. I want to come back and talk to you about the dreadful day that you both found out that Michael died. And how you see his legacy developing. How you would like it to develop.

Lavelle Smith and Michael Prince.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;ve got to ask you a difficult question because I know how close you were. Where were you both?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;ll start with you, Lavelle, when you heard that Michael had died.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I was at home in my bedroom watching CNN and I heard Michael Jackson went to the hospital with a heart attack. And I thought, OK. That&#39;s -- kept watching and it kept getting worse and worse. And I just thought this really either is a really bad publicity stunt or something is desperately wrong.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And you knew that Michael, you know, he could do publicity stunts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Of course. He&#39;s a show man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I mean, he&#39;d been in wheelchairs before to create an impression that he was somehow in a terrible state.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And then the next -- because he always had this thing, make the public go low in expectation and then dazzle them with the high. This was</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Absolutely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: P.T. Barnum. That&#39;s what you do as a showman. Yes, you build it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: A part of you is thinking --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: -- Is this another Michael stunt?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes. And I really was hoping for that. I kept hoping, and then it got worse. And then when they finally said, dead, of course, even that I didn&#39;t believe until it stayed there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: You saw that on CNN?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes. It all went up from heart attack to something happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Not breathing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Not breathing, and then dead. And I was like, OK, just wait a few more minutes. And then it didn&#39;t go away. And I thought this is really crazy. I called his assistant. And she said, it&#39;s a madhouse around here. And I thought, OK, this is the real deal. I just went numb. I remember being numb for days and days. I couldn&#39;t cry. I think anger. Just every emotion except I couldn&#39;t cry.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I didn&#39;t cry until I did the TV shows with Jermaine in London. &quot;Move Like Michael Jackson,&quot; and I was doing a little outtake like, you know, how you do for the show reading something that said Michael Jackson was -- I kept saying Michael Jackson is -- and they&#39;re like, you have to say was. I said, I got it this time. Michael Jackson is -- OK. Finally when I got was, it was over. It was over.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And for you? Where were you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: I was at the Staples Center. I was getting ready for that day&#39;s rehearsal. I had a list of changes to do from the night before, instructions from Michael. And when they said that the first thing I thought was he wants two more weeks to rehearse, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And then when they finally announced that he was D-E-A-D, I still -- I went back to my computer. I made all the changes from the night before, because I was stunned. I said, well, no, he might come back, you know. And later that day, I just -- I finally had to ask somebody what to do? And he said pack your stuff up, you know? And that was -- it was dreadful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For anything, I feel for his children, you know? He was the greatest dad in the world. Those were the loves of his life. You know? And --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: They are extraordinary children.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: They are.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: When I saw them in public recently, at the concert, I mean, they had remarkable confidence. And I guess you might expect it from Michael&#39;s --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: They were brought up so well. So much love. They read a lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Disciplined.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: A lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: It&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Well-spoken, beautiful children. And I just want them to know how much he loved them. And I saw the love that they had for him. And he and I talked about that in his dressing room, you know, about when we get to the UK, and when this seven-day week thing is done, you are going to be with your family, you know, again and have a lot more quality time with them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: What do you guys make of the trial? Did you know Conrad Murray? Did you see him much?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: No, not at all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: So all this was sort of brand new to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Right.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: To me it is simple.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Does it seem like a weird other world?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: It does. It is a world that I&#39;m forced, I don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m drawn to I have to have the information, and the stuff that I&#39;m hearing is out of this world. Out of this world. To me, it is really about a legend, a doctor and something going horribly wrong that I feel like none of us will really ever get to the bottom of. There&#39;s more that --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: My gut feeling is, I mean, Michael Jackson is not going to want to kill himself. There&#39;s no way he was in any kind of suicidal mood. SMITH: Absolutely.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Oh my God, no, no, no.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: He was enjoying the preparation. He was enjoying being a father, and so on. And just from everyone I have talked to about Conrad Murray, he didn&#39;t want to kill Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Why would he?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: So you&#39;re left with a terrible accident. And I think you are left with the technicalities of how this happened and who did what, and so which we may never know answers to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I have a feeling, I&#39;ve said, we may never know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: But was it a shock to you when the tapes were played? I mean, I was staggered.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I had no words.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: When I first heard this, I thought this can&#39;t be Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: But, listen, I know that voice, over 23 years. I knew that was him, but I didn&#39;t know why it existed. Why do that tape exist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Have either of you ever heard him speak like that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Never. Never.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Never. And honestly, I told Lavelle this, I said, I think the doctor might have made that to show Michael maybe the next day, Michael, you did fall asleep, because Michael might have said I didn&#39;t fall asleep, you know.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But no I mean -- I would have never made that recording.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(CROSSTALK)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I mean who knows what he could have done with it later. That is the only --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: That&#39;s sort of weird.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: It is weird, but it&#39;s -- it happens. Things happen that way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I mean, Michael&#39;s whole life was a bit crazy, ever since the people around him and the circus element and, you know, I just felt the whole thing just unraveled in a very, very strange way and we will probably never know what really happened.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: I don&#39;t think so.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I hope we get to. But one thing I know is important is that, what Michael taught me, all the dance and all that stuff will live on because his -- his goal was to take dance and continue to take dance to higher and higher levels.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: There were lots of theories about what Michael was planning to do. What was he planning to do?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: We were going to do short films. You know, Michael loved the short film. We were working on a cowboy film.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Legs Diamond --</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Legs Diamond.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: He wanted to do like a modern musical on &quot;Legs Diamond.&quot; Because Michael already had some gangster-ish, sounds like &quot;Smooth Criminal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Yes, &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Criminal.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: I heard he also wanted to release singles every few months.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(CROSSTALK)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And at the end of that have an amazing album. It could be a very unusual way of doing it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Right. And that way you don&#39;t get compared to &quot;Thriller&quot; every time you put out an album. So he was going to do it while we were on tour, maybe a single every eight weeks. And then once you had ten out, you add two new songs and you have a record.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He also wanted to do a children&#39;s album. Because he loved to write these, you know, beautiful, innocent songs for children. He wanted to do a classical album, because he had a lot of melodies that he didn&#39;t want to write words to.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: How good was Michael Jackson, as an entertainer?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: The best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Let&#39;s talk voice, first of all, his voice. How good a singer was he?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: Amazing. I mean, he could go from a ballad, a soft song, to -- he had one of the best rock voices. I mean, I would compare it to, you know, somebody like in -- not like Led Zeppelin, but I mean, he could sing rock &#39;n&#39; roll like you wouldn&#39;t believe, you know. I always wanted to like get him on some really hard rock stuff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: And dance-wise, mesmerize?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Top. Just top of the line, you know. MORGAN: Have you ever seen a better dancer?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: A better natural dancer? Not in my life so far ever. I mean, I was trained ballet dancer and we would share, he would teach me, because his stuff was always so strange to me, but once we started sharing, I shared ballet moves or technical things, and he would share his stuff. And that&#39;s where our bond came from, just a sharing of dance and a love of dance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: How do you think, finally, Michael would like to be remembered?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: I think he would like to be remembered as someone that was always, you know, making sure that what he delivered to his fans and to his audience was original. It was innovative. And he didn&#39;t mind if people copy it, but he would always wanted to be the one that did it first.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Michael, you were going to say?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: I was going to agree with that and say that anything he wanted to do, he wanted it to be the best. He wanted himself to be the best, every dancer behind him, every musician, down to the lighting, down to whoever was running what piece of equipment, they had to be the best.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: Cameras. Everything had choreography. I love it when he use that word. The cameras have choreography. The light have choreography. And that&#39;s kind of stuff he taught me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: That&#39;s what he was. He was remarkable. I mean, to me, he achieved that. He was the best. The best entertainer I ever saw.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: He really was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MORGAN: Lavelle, Michael, thank you both very much. A pleasure meeting you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">SMITH: It has been my pleasure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">PRINCE: My pleasure.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan &ldquo;Sugarfoot&rdquo; Moffett, drummer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808105027/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/mumu2.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Rhythm&rdquo; magazine (July 2010)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;What you see in that movie, &#39;This Is It&#39;, is how great the band sounded from rehearsing from the first week of May through to June 15th, which is pretty extraordinary for a band to sound that great in such a short period&quot;, says Jonathan. &quot;We&#39;d think we had it all set, then Michael and the dancers would come in the next day and say, &#39;There&#39;s going to be a change in every song.&#39; They were trying to get the show down to two and a half hours, so each day we had to remember changes. It is pretty remarkable how tight that band was in the film, which was supposed to be Michael&#39;s home movies.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For &quot;This Is It&quot;, Jonathan Moffett had a colossal kit complete with three kick drums. &quot;There&#39;s a 22&quot;, 24&quot;, and a 26&quot; bass drum on that kit. I played them melodically like a 83 organist plays the bass pedals&quot;, says Jonathan. &quot;I used that on &#39;Beat It&#39;, &#39;Black or White&#39;, &#39;Dirty Diana&#39;, which is not in the film, and &#39;Jam&#39;. I would break up the pattern between the three bass drums and play it dynamically on all three. &quot;Once you hit a bass drum and take your foot off to hit another one, the mallet on the first drum is still swinging&quot;, explains Jonathan. &quot;You have to practice to interpret the swing of the mallet, otherwise you won&#39;t be able to get the full stroke of the pedal. It takes a little time to work with, but it&#39;s incredibly dynamic. You can EQ each bass drums to your liking and you can pan them. My main bass drum is the 24&quot;, straight up the middle, and then I have the 26&quot; bass drum on the left hand side and the bass drum on the right is the 22&quot;. You can almost see the beats in front of the PA system.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="http://www.themjcast.com/episode-061-jonathan-sugarfoot-moffett-special/"><span class="cs8567212B">The MJCast, Episode 061 (July 21, 2017)</span></a></span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Q):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> And then a few years after [the &ldquo;Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration&rdquo; TV special], new fans were born with the &quot;This is It&quot; project. What were the rehearsal sessions like for &quot;This is It&quot; before Michael became involved, like learning all of the later songs and things like that? Because these are such milestone events that they created new fans right from these moments.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, it was mainly about pulling the show together, everybody doing their job, much like the other ones. Learning the songs, as far as musicians are concerned, I didn&#39;t know the band got put together a little bit late... I got called on the 15th of April and I went in on the 16th, my drums and everything set up, but we didn&#39;t have all the band members it just yet, they had to audition some people between for the next two weeks or so. We didn&#39;t really have the full band &#39;til like the first week I think it was of May. So, what you heard on that movie was not a lot of time. Usually we take about two to three months to rehearse, sometimes three and a half months to rehearse the tours. Two months with the band then two to three weeks with the lighting and staging. It&#39;s kind of normal, but what was heard in that film was pulled together, say from the first or second week of May through the unthinkable, which is the 24th of June. So that&#39;s not a hell of a lot of time, we had a lot of songs to learn. Everybody was focused and pulling all these elements together and doing their parts and contributing what was expected of them, and it shows professionalism all across the board, from the lighting and staging, the sound, stage crews, the department heads and leaders, and the sound engineers on both monitors and sound, the film crew, and in the band, of course, wardrobe, and the band itself, and of course the dancers and Michael, and Kenny Ortega. What was seen was only part of it, and from what I know&mdash;and they&#39;ve been told during the last week of rehearsal, that there was the next week was some things that none of us had seen before that was supposed to be introduced, a production-wise, a magic act or trick or something they paid a ton of money for, to produce&mdash;over a million dollars to produce it. It was supposed to be introduced that next week, because they kept it secret all that time. And I kept begging, &quot;Come on man, come on, I&#39;ve been with Michael a long time. Show me, you can tell me. I&#39;m not gonna tell nobody!&quot; I was trying to psyche the production, and they&#39;d laugh, laugh. He says, &quot;No, Sugarfoot. No more. You gotta wait just for next week, just like the rest of &#39;em.&quot; &nbsp;said, &quot;Aw man!&quot; I was like a little boy. &quot;Aw, man! Come on, I&#39;m not gonna tell nobody, I promise you!&quot; And he said, &quot;Nah, nah, you gotta wait for next week, but it&#39;s gonna blow your mind. This magic trick is amazing.&quot; I think Copperfield did it, or somebody did, I forgot who it&mdash;one of the biggest magicians. And there was a bunch of other things that had been seen with the outside&mdash;it was supposedly, I was told, elements of production that was going to start soon as you pull into the parking lot, and people are in the costumes and all kinds of things, and people along the ushers are in costume. It was supposed to be a big, big difference from your normal concert, so to speak. So, what you see in the film is&mdash;what I&#39;m saying, to culminate things, is that that you see about 75% of what was meant to be, but 75 to 80 percent that you&#39;ve seen and another 20 to 25 percent nobody got to see. The experience of that show that was intended to be, so it was&mdash;the film is great, and you get to see our things coming together, and it was gonna be amazing, the music&mdash;and we were still working on the music at that time too, so it wasn&#39;t completely done. The actual finished product was gonna be even greater than what was introduced in the film so just&mdash;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, well I think, musically, it&#39;s one of my favorite sounding Michael Jackson tours. The sound is incredible, the actual&mdash;the production of the music is&mdash;I think Michael Bearden really put together something amazing. Was that the first time you&#39;d worked with a percussionist as well? I think Bashiri Johnson was working with you on a lot of the rhythms as well, wasn&#39;t he?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> He&#39;s a very, very good friend of mine. He has a beautiful spirit. Incredible, incredible player. Yeah, and that was the first time Michael used the percussion, I worked with other percussionists and Randy of course on &quot;Victory&quot; and &quot;Triumph&quot; and stuff and&mdash;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What&#39;s the difference? Can you explain to our audience? What is the difference between a drummer and a percussionist?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Oh, a drummer plays a whole trap kit. Percussionists, they play rhythmic things within inside the rhythms that the drummers are playing as a complementary to that, and of course, they can be there nowadays. It&#39;s evolved into hand and foot instruments, but back in the day, it was just hand instruments. But it&#39;s amazing what the percussionists are doing now. I&#39;m very excited about what they&#39;re doing, and happy. I love it, they doing all kind of things with their foot, all kind of step-ons and control agents and caj&oacute;ns, all kind of things going on. Remote caj&oacute;ns, and all kind of things going on with that. It&#39;s really exciting, but the difference is that drums are the four elements of the kit, and all the different tiers. You got the upper tiers, the cymbals... its upper frequency of register of sound, brightest sound, and you got the toms with the mid-registers of sounds that you manipulate with melodic fills and intricate skills. Then you got the kick drum as the lower&mdash;the bottom in. The snare drum is in the mid-range frequency with the crack, and the mid-range tones. And then you got the lower foundation&mdash;it&#39;s a bass drum, so you got three tiers of elements of sound that are all manipulated individually, rhythmically, that come together to make the complete rhythm. Percussionists, nowadays, like I said, you&#39;re doing a lot of things. Some of them even incorporate bass drums and stuff, but as far as traditionally, they&#39;re hand instruments being the congas, the bongos, the claves, the tambourines, the shakers, and all the triangles, all elements of hand instruments. But it&#39;s evolved into something greater, which is magnificent to me, but more traditionally, percussion has complemented the drum rhythms and colored them. They made it musical even more so, by adding in to what the drum rhythm is doing, and making it one complete cycle of rhythm. So, we&#39;re very important to each other. Michael had never used a percussionist before. And as I understand Michael Bearden had decided to bring him in. I&#39;m glad and Bashiri is my buddy. I love Bashiri, we&#39;ve always had a wonderful relationship, and I respect him. He&#39;s amazing, amazing percussionist. He&#39;s worked with Whitney Houston, I mean just tremendous number of list of people, the who&#39;s who of artists, and I was glad that Michael decided to be open hard enough to allow a percussionist before. He never wanted a percussionist in his live shows, and that&#39;s a testament to Bashiri and his work, his playing and his work and his spirit. Michael felt comfortable with him, and liked him. But he&#39;s also good with his performances, enough to let him stay and want him, even though he never did take one before. He decided to bend his rule, because Bashiri was an additive to his show and entered the spirit of the people that surrounds him, meaning the personality, that Bashiri had fits into Michael&#39;s spirit and all spirits and he felt comfortable with him, and said, &quot;I don&#39;t usually do this, but I&#39;m gonna allow Bashiri.&quot; Something about Bashiri he liked, I know. And he felt, and Bashiri more than handled it. I&#39;m so glad that he was there. I wanted him to be there so once I found out he&#39;s gonna be there, I was excited and that was a great move on Bearden&#39;s part, and Bearden did a great job of producing the show and with Michael and arranging the show. I mean, a great job, and so it turned out to be&mdash;wow, the legacy of that film, I&#39;d have to say, has stood the testament of my career, because it shows what we go through and it takes to put on, not only a Michael show, but a show of that magnitude, and when we all individuals go through and all the elements of everything, and it shows the element of how I work... &#39;Cause I do a lot of sessions [unintelligible] I&#39;m mainly known for doing live shows, and it shows the element of my work. How I work, and how everybody works to make it all come together. So that an end result, when people get their tickets and come to the arena and get these seats, they get to see what they see as the full entertainment presentation, and now they get to see what goes into it, to make it that and they appreciate it more, if they had seen a show when it was done. But they got to see it and they got the one thing&mdash;very important to mention&mdash;is that they got to see that Michael was in charge. A lot of people thought that Michael had people dictating things or doing things and arranging things, and he just do what they tell him. It goes to show that Michael was in charge and he knew what he wanted&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Q):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Michael was really focused on getting his message of love, peace, humanitarianism, and looking after the planet out there, through the &quot;This Is It&quot; project. Was this true of your interactions with him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yes, absolutely. It was always&mdash;now he&#39;s been working&mdash;he worked on the show and his focus is on the show being the biggest and the greatest thing. Like he always said, his motto was &quot;Make it bigger than life. Everything&#39;s got to be bigger than life. You have to leave them walking away with something that they&#39;ll remember for the next 10 years, or maybe all their life.&quot; So, make it bigger than life. And I think that that was just a main focus, is getting the show together to impress that much and to blow people&#39;s minds and be the greatest show that ever happened. But underlying&mdash;behind the scenes and underneath all of that&mdash;was his intention to be able to further move the world and affect the world, so his philanthropy and his caring and the things he had planned on&mdash;the money as well as his visits to the hospital&mdash;they continue like he did before, and to be present in people&#39;s lives, to touch and affect their lives. Those with little hope or no hope, the needs caring for and those with challenged physical states and the starvation in Africa. I mean, Michael&mdash;all those things was in his spirit, to be able to step in and do something about it. He&#39;s just one man, but one man could do something, and he sure did prove that. One man could do a lot. People say, &quot;I&#39;m just one man. What can I do?&quot; You can do a lot. He showed that, he proved that. And in the magnitude of who he was and what he could do, he showed and proved that. And I think that this tour was going to be an extension of that, a continuation of that. But even on a grander scale, he had plans for a lot of things that he wanted to do, to continue to wake the people up, that we need to do more for people that can&#39;t do more for themselves. We need to do more for the earth and the planet, and be aware of what we&#39;re doing to it, and it&#39;s our only home. He cares about ecology. He cares about every little thing&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MJCast (Jamon):</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did you have any inkling as the tour was progressing in production&mdash;did you have any inkling that he was battling something so full-on in his personal life or&mdash;many around you, like Kenny Ortega and Karen Faye, they could pick something was up. Did you notice, or were you just focused on the music and the performance with him?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Moffett:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When I first saw him&mdash;when I first got there for rehearsals and we finally saw each other, I saw him and he was a distance away on the phone. He got off the phone, he came and hugged me. When I hugged him, I said, &quot;My God, there&#39;s nothing here!&quot; He was so skinny and frail, I was scared. I mean, I really had genuine fear within me. That was first day of rehearsal. I got there, I think it was the 16th of April, and I was afraid, but I knew Michael was always thin, but he was painfully thin then. But I also&mdash;you got to remember, and I remember. He had just went through extraordinary ordeal in that courtroom with all that stuff, that teared [him] down spiritually, mentally, and physically, so I knew he was trying to come back from that, rebuild himself and his health and everything from that. That was so destructive and I knew that&mdash;maybe that was why, because they had heard, in the press, that he wasn&#39;t eating, and he was having trouble like that for things like that, so&mdash;but it shocked me to no end how my arms wrapped around him, and touched my own shoulders, and I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh my god&quot;. But then we got into rehearsals, he was fine. Most of the time. Sometimes he would seem tired, but I can understand that, because you learn all the hats, we ran all the hats, the promotion aspect of the show, the accounting aspect, meeting with accountants, meeting with the lawyers, all this during one single day on the phone. And physically, you&#39;re meeting with your management team, you&#39;re meeting with the wardrobe people, measuring up the top of my costumes and stuff, you&#39;re meeting with the dancers, all this is separately. Then you gotta meet with the background singers and work with them and get that stuff right, then you gotta come eventually to the band, then you gotta meet with everybody, and do it all together. That&#39;s just so many hats to wear, that can wear anybody down, and the kind of energy he puts out. Now even knew what he wasn&#39;t gonna pull out at rehearsals. You got to remember, he hadn&#39;t been on tour since &#39;87 or &#39;89 we did those two shows, and he had just been through a tremendously horrible ordeal, and it&#39;d break anybody down spiritually, mentally, and physically, so my fear was his weight and his physical stature, but then he show days, like &quot;I see nothing wrong with him, what am I worried about? He&#39;s killing it up there, he&#39;s tearing it up&quot;. But, I say the tiredness, I thought, came from all of those meetings he had to have. I just get there&mdash;I drive from home, I wait until the time last minute before the time for me to show up at the rehearsal, I drive from home, go right then the time to rehearse, and that&#39;s all I got to do. Finish rehearsals, drive home. He had to be there early in the morning, do different things, meetings, all his meetings I mentioned, and be a part of every aspect of it pretty much. That was very difficult, of course you&#39;re going to be tired. So I didn&#39;t think about so much fear about all that, because I knew how it takes. It always took a lot out of him because he&#39;s doing everything. So yeah, I was there, and sometimes he would be there, and he wouldn&#39;t&mdash;he&#39;d be like, a little disoriented about parts and stuff like that, he would [unintelligible] be my position, and stuff, he wouldn&#39;t be with the other dancers, but I knew he was tired. Then the next thing you know, he&#39;ll come in here, and he will kill it. I mean, like &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the Michael I know! That&#39;s Michael!&quot; He would absolutely kill it. So I knew it was fluctuating from day to day, that he would be different. Sometimes two or three days really great, then next day, he is just tired. He wasn&#39;t sleeping&mdash;now I didn&#39;t know he had the problem sleeping. I had no idea, all the years I worked with him. I didn&#39;t know he needed that stuff to sleep. I didn&#39;t know he had a sleeping problem, issue. I never knew that he kept it quiet, and I had never knew it felt like that. So that was a shock to me when I found out what was happening. I said, &quot;No, how did he kill those shows on the &#39;HIStory Tour&#39; with no sleep?&quot; That made him more of a Superman, if you can put doing them shows like he did on &quot;HIStory Tour&quot;&mdash;they said he was going through that no sleep period back then too&mdash;and I said, How did he do that? He&#39;s really a Superman, &#39;cause he was killing the shows on the &quot;HIStory Tour&quot;. It was amazing, and on the &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; special, so further to me, he earned the cape, the &quot;M&quot; on his chest or whatever, because if he was going through all that stuff with no sleep and perform the way he did, it&#39;s absolutely remarkable he could put on a two and a half hour show, a two hour show under those conditions, and perform like he did on the &quot;HIStory Tour&quot; and on the &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; special. So, my thing is I didn&#39;t know he was having sleep problems. That was something that was kept from me. I didn&#39;t know that until the trial, so&mdash;but there was a lot of days he was right on. And he was directing things, as you could see in the film... I think he had something wrong with the sleep element and stuff like that... I&#39;d never heard the word &ldquo;Propofol&rdquo; in my life until the trial, but I didn&#39;t know he was doing that stuff, but what I&#39;m trying to say is&mdash;yeah, he had some impairments, I could tell. Something was wrong. But then he&#39;d come and kill it the next day, so what I&#39;m saying is&mdash;if he was totally dysfunctional and torn down, you wouldn&#39;t have a &quot;This Is It&quot; film, would you? It would be nothing good enough to produce it. This is a film with&mdash;there was enough of him there, that he was trying to rebuild as you remember, where he&#39;d get himself back together from a hiatus of touring since &#39;97, and enough of him to rebuild it to give you enough great footage to do &quot;This Is It&quot;. Now, he&#39;s pulling himself back together. It may not have been the &quot;right on point&quot; on everything, but he was good in a lot of things, enough for the world to appreciate that film, you know what I&#39;m saying? There was a lot of things I wasn&#39;t privy to know, that I didn&#39;t know was going wrong or going on, so I was blinded to that until the trials. Remember when I saw him &quot;on&quot; some days and I saw him some days troubling to me, I was worried about him, but I knew he was tired, and I thought about it. I was trying to figure it out. I said, &quot;Man, Jonathan. He&#39;s got to do all the other things, work with all the elements of the show. Of course he&#39;s tired.&quot; Neither rationalize it that way, not thinking, because I didn&#39;t know he was sick or not sleeping or taking that stuff, so my rationalization said that he&#39;s doing all these other things, meetings, and rehearsals, and stuff. That&#39;s why he was tired. But that&#39;s the way I explained it to myself and from what I saw.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Andrae Crouch, producer/arranger for various songs of Michael, Facebook post (June 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.worthychristianforums.com/topic/106750-did-michael-jackson-repent-accept-christ/"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">We recently met with Michael to discuss recording two songs with our choir for his newest recording project. Michael always had a respect and curiosity for spiritual things. During our meeting, not unlike many other creative/music meetings we&#39;ve had with him the past, we sang together, prayed together and had a wonderful time. We are praying for Michael&#39;s family and desire nothing less than God&#39;s best for them. With much love, Sandra Crouch and Andrae&rsquo; Crouch</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Root&rdquo; magazine (October 7, 2011) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213225211/http://rootmagazineonline.com/featured-content/1970/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Root:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You were very close with the &ldquo;King of Pop&rdquo;, Michael Jackson. Is it true that a few weeks before he died, he met with you and accepted Jesus or was that a rumor?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Andrae Crouch</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Put it like this, we were getting ready to do another three songs with him at his house. On that day we talked and caught up on what was going on with him and vice versa, and what was funny was he had this little cheap CD player with [him], and he played music that he wanted me to arrange vocals for, but he didn&rsquo;t have any words, and that was the first time that we worked with him and he didn&rsquo;t have any lyrics. He started putting some words together and then I would write the next line and we did that back and forth. I then told him I could have the group back there to rehearse the songs separately, because usually I was a little stand offish when we had the singers there, because he would be talking to us from the booth, writing lyrics and all of that. At this point, he didn&rsquo;t know what the song would be, but we kept writing back and forth. Michael then said to me, &ldquo;You wanna know why I love you and Sandra so much?&rdquo;, and I said, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Because I trust you guys and I love you&rdquo;. &nbsp;He then wanted to set up a time where we can bring the singers to learn the song, but he couldn&rsquo;t get the words together, so he brought his kids to the room where we were, and he told them, &ldquo;This is the guy that arranged the songs that you guys like&rdquo;, and he told the children, &ldquo;I love them&rdquo;. He went on to say how much he loved us, because he never heard anything about us saying negative stuff about him. What was really interesting was as we were talking he said, &ldquo;Andrae, there are some things I wanted to ask you&rdquo;, and he said, &ldquo;When I see you on TV and you are singing and your hands are up in the air, is that called the anointing?&rdquo; I said, where did you hear that word? He said he didn&rsquo;t know, but when he sees it, it seems like when you do that, the power falls down, he said it&rsquo;s very powerful. I was wondering where he learned that, because I knew he had never been to a Pentecostal church. We talked for many hours and my sister Sandra said, &ldquo;Michael, we feel like you are our son&rdquo;, and he said that he felt the same way, so Sandra asked if we could pray for him, and he said yes. We all got in a circle and began praying and he squeezed my hand so tight that it was hurting. We began praying, and we said, &ldquo;Lord, we want you to change Michael&rsquo;s life&rdquo;, and he prayed everything that we said. I know that he accepted the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Root</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: How long was this before he passed away?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Andrae Crouch</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It was one week. &nbsp;God is so merciful. He had no problems with us praying with him and he had both of his hands up. There is no doubt in my mind that he did accept the Lord. We had the choir there and he would normally be isolated from everyone but this particular time he stood right in the middle of us all.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Root</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how God used you to reach someone like Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Andrae Crouch</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yes it is. In fact I used to hear that most of the people who worked with him were Muslims but at the funeral he had a Pentecostal guy conduct the funeral. I actually sat next to Quincy Jones and Gladys Knight. It still amazes me, because at the rehearsal before he passed, he stood right there in the middle of us all and talked about the tour and how the stage was going to be built and what it would look like. But in the same breath he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna go on this tour, I just don&rsquo;t feel right about it&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what he said. He kinda knew that something was going on, but he didn&rsquo;t know what. I know he is with the Lord, because he was so ready. When we did the song &ldquo;Man in the mirror&rdquo;, we would do a warm up song called &ldquo;It Won&rsquo;t Be Long&rdquo;, and every time we got together, he told me that he always would sing that song to himself, and he asked if we could sing that song for him, and I said, &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;. He loved that song, and he was so gentle, and I praise God for the work that he did in his life before he went to be with the Lord.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">...I remember Michael Jackson called me up when I was sick and he called me up and said &ldquo; Andrae when are you going to be well so we can make more history&rdquo;. I told him that, &ldquo;I will be OK&rdquo;. He said we would get some dates together soon. One of my goals in life was to point him to Jesus and I knew he would get saved.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Randy Phillips, AEG president, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jun-27-fg-jackson-world27-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (June 27, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200405161008/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jun-27-fg-jackson-world27-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">As envisioned by Randy Phillips, chief executive of AEG Live, the concert promoter behind Jackson&rsquo;s comeback, his London concerts would have been the first of a four-phase world tour, hitting Australia, Europe and Asia -- including India, China and Japan -- before heading to North America.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;We felt London was the right place to start this comeback,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do I think the international marketplace is a little less judgmental than America can be?

If he failed to perform, Jackson would have to reimburse AEG more than $30 million, according to the defense.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">The judge ruled, however, that the 42-page contract would distract and confuse jurors and barred the defense from questioning Phillips, who signed the document along with Jackson, about its details. But after the executive repeatedly referred to the contractual obligations on both sides, defense attorney Ed Chernoff was permitted to ask if Jackson &ldquo;was ultimately responsible&rdquo; for the production costs.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yes, Phillips replied.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s mother, Katherine, is suing AEG for wrongful death, and a lawyer for AEG accompanied Phillips to court and sat in the spectator&rsquo;s gallery as he testified.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Phillips said &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; grew out of a 2008 phone call from Philip Anschutz, the billionaire head of AEG Live&rsquo;s parent company. Anschutz asked him to meet with Century City financier Tom Barrack, whose company had recently purchased a note on Jackson&rsquo;s Neverland ranch.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson said achieving stability for his family was the motivating factor for performing again, Phillips testified.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;The primary reason was that he wanted to finally settle down and get a really, really good home for the kids and his family so they weren&rsquo;t, in his words, living like vagabonds,&rdquo; Phillips said.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">The children were present in the Hotel Bel-Air suite for the Oct. 2008 meeting &mdash; he recalled that they wore Halloween costumes &mdash; and Phillips said the discussion about securing them a home &ldquo;got emotional&rdquo; and both men teared up.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">The defense has suggested that Jackson was forced by Phillips and AEG into more shows than the 10 originally scheduled, but the executive denied that. He said that 31 shows were always planned and that Jackson agreed to 19 additional concerts &ldquo;in 20 minutes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">His only conditions were that Phillips get the Guinness Book of World Records to document his 50-show feat and rent him a sprawling country home outside London for his children.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;He was very specific. He wanted 16-plus acres, running streams, horses,&rdquo; Phillips said. &ldquo;He wanted to give them a pastoral country vibe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was also adamant about bringing Murray to London.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Phillips testified that Murray assured him In June 2009 that the singer was in perfect health.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two weeks later, things had taken a different turn. The concert director, choreographer Kenny Ortega, had grown frustrated with Jackson&rsquo;s repeated absence from rehearsals and wondered in an e-mail to Phillips if it might be time they &ldquo;pulled the plug.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">At a subsequent meeting five days before Jackson&rsquo;s death, Murray &ldquo;guaranteed us that Michael would get into it, would connect,&rdquo; Phillips recalled.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Phillips denied that the shows were ever in doubt but acknowledged that Jackson&rsquo;s problems &ldquo;focusing&rdquo; might have delayed the concerts.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;At some point it could be postponed to the point that production would not be possible?&rdquo; Chernoff asked.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speculate on that,&rdquo; Phillips replied.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Lou Ferrigno, physical trainer, &quot;Inside Kung-Fu&quot; magazine (December 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808103125/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/hulkteachesmj.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inside Kung Fu: Tell us a little about the paces you were putting Michael through in preparation for his tour. Many have been surprised that one of the world&#39;s most-famous body builders, known to millions as the &ldquo;Hulk,&rdquo; was training a tiny, almost elfin man to perform as a singer and dancer.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">LOU: In addition to making a living as an actor and doing personal appearances, I&#39;m also a professional fitness instructor, and I&#39;ve been providing personal training to a number of clients over the years&mdash;some of whom just happen to be famous. Although I&#39;m certainly willing and very able to show someone what it takes to be a professional body builder, that&rsquo;s not what most people are looking for&mdash;not everybody wants to be the Hulk&mdash;so we get together and decide what their needs and goals are, and I put together a program that will help them reach those goals. For Michael, he&rsquo;s an entertainer&mdash;a singer and a dancer&mdash;so we concentrated on developing core strength and cardiovascular endurance. It&#39;s funny, when we first started working together this time, I brought over a big fitness ball&mdash;the kind you do abdominal and core exercises on&mdash;and a pair of five-pound dumbbells. Michael didn&#39;t want to use the dumbbells, because he said he didn&rsquo;t want to get big and muscular! So for our next session, I brought a smaller ball, and a couple of three-pound dumbbells, and he stilt didn&rsquo;t want to use them, because he said, &ldquo;Lou, I don&#39;t want to put on a lot of muscle!&quot; I love Michael, but I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at that. Like you can put on muscle with three-pound weights!</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">IKF: Was this the first time you trained Michael for touring?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">LOU: No, I helped get him ready for his 1994 World Tour, and trained him on and off for the last 15 years, We were friends longer than that, though&mdash;over 20&mdash;probably closer to 25 years.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">IKF: How did you two meet?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">LOU: How do most people meet? We were introduced through a mutual friend and just hit it off.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">CARLA: Lou and Michael bonded pretty quickly. Some people might think it&#39;s unusual, because just to look at them, you&#39;d have a hard time finding two more dissimilar people, but inside, where it matters, they had some things in common. They were both, by nature, very shy people who were forced to overcome that, to a certain degree, because they chose careers in the entertainment industry. They both knew what it was to feel like an outsider. Also, they had very similar types of fathers&mdash;think you know what I&#39;m talking about&mdash;and they bonded over that pretty deeply as well.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">IKF: Some folks have criticized Lou for not recognizing the deteriorated state of Michael&#39;s health. Following Lou&#39;s July 2 interview with Fox News&#39; Greta Van Susteren, a posting on her GretaWire.com read,</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;How could he [Lou] be such a good friend to MJ and not see what was happening to his health? He&#39;s a trainer and I&#39;m sure he saw the ray- ages of his frailty from the drug abuse.&rdquo; How do you answer that?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">LOU: Look, I&#39;m a fitness expert, not a health guru. When we were working together, I never saw any indication that anything was wrong with Michael. He seemed like he was in great shape! Nor did I personally see any indications of drug use. Whenever I was with him, he was always bright, alert and energetic.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">CARLA: Michael did complain that he&rsquo;d been having trouble sleeping, and Lou gave him some calcium magnesium supplements-health food store stuff&mdash;that helps Lou sleep when he&rsquo;s having trouble, but Michael never tried it.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">IKF: Since you raised the subject of alleged drug use and sleeping pills, there&#39;s been some loose talk that if Michael did die of a drug overdose, it might have been intentional. What&#39;s your take?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">LOU: Look, right now, as you and I are talking, no one knows exactly what caused Michael Jackson&#39;s death. It&rsquo;s possible in the days and weeks ahead we may find out, or we may never know for sure. The one thing I can say, though, without a doubt in my mind, is that Michael didn&#39;t mean to not wake up. He was a man who loved his children and was a great father, and he was more excited about the future than I&#39;d seen him in a long time. He was even talking about being my trainer for &ldquo;Dancing With The Stars&rdquo;! He said he&#39;d teach me how to do the moonwalk. While we were working out, he was upbeat and energetic. He&#39;d dance for me and sing... To the rest of the world, he was a superstar, but to me, he was a sweet, gentle man, who always wanted to entertain, always wanted to please people, and who always made me laugh, I&#39;m really going to miss him.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Anjelica Huston, &quot;The Supreme Leader&quot; (evil queen) actress, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1907409_1907413_1907499,00.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Time&rdquo; (June 26, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319113158/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1907409_1907413_1907499,00.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">We had lunch together about a month ago, and he talked about his ordeal.

Michael rehearsed 10 or 11 songs. He sang and danced, not always at full power, but the way you do for a run-through. When the show was over, he called me, but I was in the back getting something. He found me, and said, &lsquo;Frank, I am so happy. He said he was just so happy. He said, This is really our time. He put his arm around me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">For DiLeo, the memory of that moment will always be reassuring. But the insanity of Jackson&rsquo;s death, the timing of it, is what is craziest for him. Jackson and DiLeo had not worked together officially for 20 years. In the last couple of weeks, though, DiLeo had re-upped officially as manager. Jackson was very excited about working with him. They had a lot of plans.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://youtu.be/E7NqrDLdN0A"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Raffles Entertainment&rdquo; (November 4, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808154931/http://www.positivelymichael.com/forums/showthread.php?37-Transcript-of-Raffles-van-Exel-interviewing-Frank-DiLeo"><span class="cs8567212B">archived transcript</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: There is a group, a small organization as you know of now called This Is Not It. Supposedly numerous of them have written letters to Michael the day before or 48 hours before Michael&rsquo;s passing explaining their concern about his health, that he was getting skinnier and skinnier. What is your take on that?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Well, it&rsquo;s great that they wrote letters. I&rsquo;m not aware of them. There was a concern by one of the staff members that Michael lost a few pounds. I brought it up with Michael. I forced a meeting with the doctor which we never met until that time.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">They said that Michael was in good shape. That yes he did lose a couple of pounds because he wanted to. He was eating healthy, he was eating right, he was taking all the right vitamins.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&rsquo;s what we were told. I went back to that staff member, (xg)&hellip;he was 136 pounds; he wasn&rsquo;t 108 pounds like people want everybody to believe. He, in the 80s I would say, he was anywhere, if we weren&rsquo;t working, maybe 150 &ndash; 145. and I would say that when I came here in March he was about 145 &ndash; 142, but he&hellip; as a dancer, particularly in the way he danced now he wanted to be a little slimmer. You know he was in good &ndash; I think he was better health today than he was then because then he was a vegetarian and he fasted once a week and he had all these things that he did. So I think that&rsquo;s false.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Again what about Karen Faye she had made a post on her Facebook [that] there was something wrong.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: There is a lot of people besides Karen Faye that interacted with Michael and we didn&rsquo;t see anything wrong. You know Karen Faye certainly has her opinion. Karen Faye feels and felt that she was very close to Michael. I respect that. That&rsquo;s her opinion.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">...</span><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Okay. Well among the other things some fans are speculating that if AEG and everyone involved with AEG is conspiracy to murder of Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It&rsquo;s false. That is an outrageous accusation Who in the world would want to kill Michael? Do you think that AEG wanted to have 50 open dates at their O2 area. Do you think they&rsquo;re filled right now? They&rsquo;re not filled. There was no advantage to anybody doing any harm to Michael.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">This movie was not ever shot to be a movie. It was two cameras that were bought in the beginning because Michael couldn&rsquo;t afford his documentary crew that he always hired for every tour and to document all his movements. Been through it on the Victory Tour, been through it on the Bad tour. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t have the funds to do it. At the last minute Paul Gongaware who worked the Victory tour, who worked the Bad Tour as a cameraman suggested, &ldquo;Hey maybe I&rsquo;ll go get a couple of cameras.&rdquo; They bought a couple of cameras for like six thousand, just to film the rehearsals. There was no intention of like, &ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;ll cause some harm to Michael so we can put out a movie.&rdquo; Thank God we had it.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">:Thank God.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Thank God for the fans.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">:Yup.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: And how that happened was after Michael passed we were sitting around and we were looking at some footage, you know just sort of remembering, wow what could have been and what a great time we would have had and somebody in the room, I don&rsquo;t know who it was, said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame the fans will never get to see this concert&rdquo;. Somebody else said, &ldquo;Well maybe we should see if there&rsquo;s a movie here, at least show everybody what he was working on you know and something about him.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s how it came about and people don&rsquo;t understand that 90 percent of all profits from this film go to Michael&rsquo;s estate and children.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Well I&rsquo;m personally glad that that movie was there. Movie, documentary whatever they want to call it because yes it has. I mean, I think you and I we discussed it, we talked about it too, this was the only proper way to show the world and to keep the man&rsquo;s legacy alive.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Exactly, exactly.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yeah I mean &ndash;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: and I think it&rsquo;s a great tribute to Michael. I think it turned out well.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: It turned out more than well.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: We all would rather see the concert live.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Oh exactly that was &ndash;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael was very excited about going over there, you know, he really wanted to go over there he told me that last night. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do the 50 shows. We&rsquo;re going to reap what we&rsquo;ve sown Frank, it&rsquo;s our time to do it again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was, and he was going to do the 50 and we talked about doing 20 stadiums in Japan and taking the tour on. He knew he had to work a year and a half. He knew he had to do it and he couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out there.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yeah, well, I agree. Our writer would not have seen the movie because that means we&rsquo;d all be in London and joining Michael Jackson mania but&hellip;yeah.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">To your best knowledge where were both you and Leonard Rowe &ndash; Michael&rsquo;s manager for a period of time, did Michael signed 2 conflict contracts?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Two conflict contracts. What do you mean, two conflicting contracts?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Some of the fans are stating that you were his manager but also Leonard Rowe stated that he was Michael&rsquo;s manager.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yeah Leonard Rowe had Michael sign a contract that said he had the right to review the finances, alright, he did that before I got here. When I got here he says, &ldquo;I signed a contract with Leonard Rowe to look at my finances, the tour finances.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well why would you do that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said, &ldquo;Well my dad was in the room and they wanted me to sign it and I signed it.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;But you have to meet with Leonard and we&rsquo;ll straighten it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I met with Leonard and he asked me about the contract and stuff and I said, &ldquo;First of all, Michael signed that because Joseph was looking over his shoulder.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Second of all, he honestly doesn&rsquo;t want you to be involved and I can&rsquo;t give you that information because Michael doesn&rsquo;t want you to have it, you&rsquo;re going to have to get it off AEG.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">AEG wouldn&rsquo;t deal with him because he has a very checkered past, and you know they weren&rsquo;t going to do it. So then Michael and I were going to write a letter, which he would have signed, and you know would have eliminated him but there was no lawyer in place at that moment. Now we did send out some, had some other letters drawn up that uh uh stressed the fact that I was now the manager and not Dr. Tohme and that you know people had to deal with me and make their requests though me. We kind of forgot about Leonard Rowe. </span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">When there was a meeting on the 15th, I think it was of May, which Leonard Rowe attended, I was out of town at the time with AEG it&rsquo;s been widely noted and uh Randy Phillips answered all the questions and Michael sat in, and his mother sat in and at the end of the meeting Michael was extremely happy. He called me up he said you know we have to write a letter to Leonard to get him out of the picture. </span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Which when I came back we wrote up the letter, he signed it. I sent one copy to his hotel, the Sportsman&rsquo;s Lodge, that was delivered to him, another copy uh to Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s Assistant in their office, I notified them that it was coming and they should show it to Leonard Rowe. So he was quite aware that he had been dismissed. Did he want to accept it? No. Did they want to pretend like they didn&rsquo;t get it? No. But it was (1g) there.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: In late 2008 You apparently signed a deal promising Michael would appear with his family on a show.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: AllGood Entertainment put the show together with Michael and his brothers and later tried to sue Michael for allegedly breach of contract for 20 million dollars.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Well let me just explain that to you. Some guys came into my office; they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to do a world tour with the family or pay per view.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well Michael&rsquo;s not going to work with his family and he&rsquo;s not going to do pay per view.&rdquo; &ldquo;Please, please, please just talk to him about it.&rdquo; So they came up with this idea, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to give him 30 million, we&rsquo;re going to give him 15 million then we are going to-&ldquo; I said, &ldquo;Look it&rsquo;s not going to work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, write it up, I&rsquo;ll tell Michael about it. If he wants to do it fine but I&rsquo;m telling you right now he&rsquo;s not going to do it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but where&rsquo;s the money coming from? Do you have the money?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yeah we got the money don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through a million of you guys there is tons of people coming in and out of my office. They want to know if they can do this if they can have that, if it&rsquo;s a good idea and you present it to Michael and there&rsquo;s no money, what&rsquo;s the sense in me wasting my time?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I said, &ldquo;You put 10% as a retainer, in a Escrow account, in my account in which I am going to take $150,000 or up to for expenses because I&rsquo;m not flying all over the country to talk to Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">On your behalf.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">DiLeo:Yeah, on your behalf for nothing. You know, not that I&rsquo;m not going to get paid, I just want my expenses. I said I know what it is to sit in a hotel room for nine days waiting for him to show up. Everybody agreed, they had a deadline. That money never reached that account. We had a call, they needed a little extension. Fine, I gave it to them verbally. The money never hit the account.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I went to one or two meetings where they were trying to raise money. And by the way, there&rsquo;s a non-disclosure agreement that all those people signed saying they would not talk about this deal. In other words, they had the money they didn&rsquo;t have to go out and raise it. What they were doing was getting my signature and going out trying to raise money.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">That deal was null and void right there because they broke the non-disclosure. So what I think happened, this is just my thought, okay, but they must have borrowed some money for their expenses and they had to pay that back because they guaranteed the guy the deal was going to happen. Now they&rsquo;re scrambling with a lawsuit</span><span class="cs31D24DEE">.</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I did not ever tell them I represented Michael Jackson or the brothers. Because I didn&rsquo;t. I was Michael&rsquo;s friend.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Who had an in.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yeah, who could get Michael on the phone. While what we were talking about were movie projects. Now when March came, first of all Michael signed his deal with AEG, I believe, in London before he made the announcement. I had no idea. We didn&rsquo;t really discuss what he was doing with AEG, he did it, you know what I mean, we talked after that, again about movies. I said, &ldquo;I see you made a deal.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m very happy.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this for my children because they&rsquo;ve never seen me perform and I want them to see why people chase me in cars. &ldquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because they have questions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; I never said &ldquo;Do you need my help? Can I be involved? Do want to do this other deal?&rdquo; Okay? So now he calls me in March and says, &ldquo;Frank have you ever met, do you know Randy Phillips?&rdquo; I said no. I said &ldquo;I know who he is&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;To tell you the truth our paths have never crossed&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;When I managed you before he was doing something else&rdquo;. I think it was with Rod Stewart.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Yeah, Rolling Stones or Rod Stewart.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;Well, would you do a conference call tomorrow with me and Randy?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do a conference call but what&rsquo;s it about?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t wanna do a conference call just to do a conference call.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said, &ldquo;Well I want to know if you&rsquo;ll manage me again.&rdquo; And I said &ldquo;Well yeah sure&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Well you know I&rsquo;m doing these concerts and I need help. You know how to do this, you know what I want.&rdquo; Next day we had a conference call. Michael and I spoke, Randy kind of listened, we got introduced over the phone and Randy says to Michael, &ldquo;It sounds like you have a real comfort level with Frank&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">He said, &ldquo;Absolutely, I should have never fired him Randy, I love the guy he&rsquo;s honest, I love his wife, I love his children, he&rsquo;s who I want to manage me.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;When can you come out here?&rdquo; and I said, &ldquo;I can get out there probably next week because I have to close up what I&rsquo;m doing here.&rdquo; I did. I came out. I met Randy the day after I arrived. We started the rehearsals. I was at rehearsals. I met with Michael every day until he passed away I was with him. So as far as there being a conspiracy for, with AllGood, how can it be a conspiracy, I never met the guy. You know what I mean? I never met him. We didn&rsquo;t conspire against them, that&rsquo;s a joke. And you know these claims will be answered in court I&rsquo;m sure</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: In due time.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Well it&rsquo;s coming up pretty soon, it&rsquo;s started.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Okay. Okay, can you tell us a little about Dr. Tohme&rsquo;s role with Michael? He was, uh is he still dealing in Michael&rsquo;s businesses?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Okay. Okay, can you tell us a little about Dr. Tohme&rsquo;s role with Michael? He was, uh is he still dealing in Michael&rsquo;s businesses? It seems that he still has presence with everything, including in the movie, is he totally out or&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: He&rsquo;s not in the movie. How&rsquo;s he in the movie?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">When they arrived in London.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Was he in there?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Exel: Yeah.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">DiLeo: I didn&rsquo;t even see that.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Really? Well here&rsquo;s what happened, somebody &ndash; Michael told me when I got here, &ldquo;I need a doctor when we go to London. We have to hire a doctor.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Okay. What for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Now we&rsquo;re talking about Doctor Tohme, not the Doctor Murray</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No, no, we&rsquo;re not talking about Doctor Murray, we&rsquo;re talking about a doctor. I didn&rsquo;t know it was Murray at the time. He said, I said, &ldquo;What do you need a doctor for?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Well, Frank, I&rsquo;m the show. If I get sick, if I get a fever, we got to have a doctor to make sure that I eat right, that I have the right fluids&hellip;&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;, I get that part. So a couple months go by, I don&rsquo;t know this doctor but he is a doctor that he met in Vegas. That I think, according to what I heard, Michael called him when one of the kids had a cold or wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and that&rsquo;s how he met him and whatever friendship they had, they had.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">So then we hear back that Doc &ndash; no I&rsquo;m sorry, as soon as we get closer to leaving Michael says, &ldquo;Have you found a doctor yet?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know Michael I think were going get you a doctor when we get to London, I&rsquo;ll find you one, we&rsquo;re going to go a week in advance.&rdquo; &ldquo;No. I have to have my own doctor. &ldquo; I said &ldquo;Well to tell you the truth I didn&rsquo;t know you had a doctor. Who&rsquo;s your doctor?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Doctor Murray.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Well you have to give me his number.&rdquo; So I got his number. Now Doctor Murray wanted a exorbitant amount of money to close his practices, to go to London and live there for 8 months with his family and everybody. So he mentioned the number to one of the people negotiating. And I said &ldquo;We&rsquo;re never paying that&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I went in to Michael and said &ldquo;This is what he asked for.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;For that figure, I&rsquo;ll get on a plane tonight, I&rsquo;ll fly to London and I&rsquo;m going to buy you a hospital.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: (Laughs)</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: He sort of laughed. He said &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s ridiculous, figure out a common ground somewhere&rdquo;. So we negotiated and we got him down. He wanted a certain number and I yelled &ldquo; No, this is what the artist wants to pay $150 and he accepted it. Now the contract, he never got paid any money because Michael passed away. This was in the last 2 weeks of Michael&rsquo;s life. His lawyer was negotiating terms with AEG&rsquo;s lawyer because AEG was funding the money. AEG didn&rsquo;t hire the guy. They didn&rsquo;t know him from, you know, catfood. He never received one payment because he didn&rsquo;t sign the contract and Michael never signed a contract, so he never got any money. Now how did I met him? This is how I met him and Randy Phillips met him, and Kenny Ortega met him and everybody else.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">One of the people that worked for us, I don&rsquo;t want to say who she is, said &ldquo;Gee I think Michael&rsquo;s you know losing weight, this and that.&rdquo; I said let me handle it, let me investigate it. I went to Michael, talked to him about it, he said &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m drinking beet juice everyday, eating Oatmeal&rdquo; and all this stuff. I said, &ldquo;Well we should meet with this doctor. Give me his number.&rdquo; That was the first time I got his number. I called the doctor, set up a meeting at Michael&rsquo;s house. We all went. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; and Michael was there, &ldquo;What is going on? Is he getting the right vitamins? Is he losing weight? Is he&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s 140 pounds, he&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;He&rsquo;s eating this, he&rsquo;s eating that and Michael&rsquo;s agreeing&rdquo;. Okay?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I said to him, kidding around, &ldquo;By the way what kind of doctor are you?&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a Cardiologist.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;A heart doctor?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wow, great&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Mike this is terrific I&rsquo;ve had 3 heart attacks I need you on the team.&rdquo; Which Michael didn&rsquo;t realize I had 3 heart attacks. The doctor started laughing and you know, but he assured everybody in that room that Michael was in good shape, he was working out everyday with Lou Ferrigno and Travis would come over and do the workouts at the house. There was no sense in Michael going to the studio to do the things he could do at home and spend that time with his children.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">We didn&rsquo;t need him to show up at Staples Center until anywhere between 4 to 6 and that&rsquo;s the way we made that schedule and that was approved by everybody in that room that day. I went back to that person, said I had a meeting, repeated what the doctor told to me and he &ndash; the doctor said it to all of us very convincingly, and Michael emphasized &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, stop worrying. I&rsquo;m not losing that much weight. I have to be a certain weight and I want a certain look to dance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well what are you supposed to do? If he says it and the Doctor says it, what am I supposed to (do), stand up and say &ldquo;Well I still don&rsquo;t believe you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: The day, June 25th, when you got the call, where were you and what went through you?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Being that we didn&rsquo;t go to Staples until 4 o clock I was at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, I was having lunch, it was an early lunch but it was 11:30. I got a call from a fan, they had just served us some lunch, I was with a friend, and uh the fan said, &ldquo;Do you know there&rsquo;s an ambulance in front of Michael&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; I said &rdquo;No&rdquo;. She said, &ldquo;Well, you know there&rsquo;s an ambulance there&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;Okay, let me get off, I&rsquo;m going to call Michael&rsquo;s Assistant&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I called Brother Michael. I said, &ldquo;Is there an ambulance in front on the house?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;. He said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going from my apartment to the house. There seems to be a problem.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;But the Doctor&rsquo;s with him.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m on my way to the house.&rdquo; I had to go to my room to get my card .ticket and I had shorts on, I wanted to put a pair of pants on. As I&rsquo;m walking I called Randy Phillips. I said &ldquo;Randy, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on but there&rsquo;s an ambulance at Michael&rsquo;s house. I know you live in Beverly Hills; go there right now, I&rsquo;m on my way, but I want you, you can get there quicker than me.&rdquo; and I hung up. He was at the cleaners, he went right to Michael&rsquo;s house. I got in my car and came out; you know Michael lives up in there in Hollywood or whatever it&rsquo;s called. I was driven to his house on many occasions, he would send somebody to pick me up. Sometimes I would follow somebody; I know how to get back. I might had driven there twice on my own. I made the wrong turn&hellip;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: All those streets there look alike.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: They all look alike, so I came from the back. So it took me maybe a extra minute, you know, to find it. Instead of going the right way I was like a street off. So I got to there and the gates were wide open and the guards were out there, and I said &ldquo;Where the ambulance?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;They took Michael to the hospital.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know which hospital. In my mind I thought it was Cedar-Sinai.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Well I said, &ldquo;I better call Randy.&rdquo; So I call Randy and I said, &ldquo;Did you get to the house?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m following the ambulance.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Where are we going? To Cedar&rsquo;s?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;No, were going to UCLA.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m on my way.&rdquo; And again, I didn&rsquo;t really know where that was. Trent called me, Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s driver; I&rsquo;m sorry, Mrs. Jackson called me. She said, &ldquo;I heard they took my son to the hospital. &ldquo;I said, &ldquo;Katherine, they did. Should I come?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on yet. Just give me a minute, and I&rsquo;ll call you back.&rdquo; I hung up.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">3 minutes later, as I&rsquo;m still driving, her driver called, &ldquo;Frank, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You know Trent, I don&rsquo;t know, but tell Katherine to come on, bring her down here, were going to UCLA, it&rsquo;s better that she comes&rdquo; because I still don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on. I get to the hospital, I see all the security. Hospital security&rsquo;s got everything blocked off, roped off, nobody&rsquo;s getting in. Randy&rsquo;s waiting for me in the emergency room area where you sit. I come in and I greet him, &ldquo;What going on?&rdquo; He says &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo; They let us back because they knew who we were. Everyone else had to hold on.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">We got to the little room, you know, we heard them working on him, we thought he was alive&hellip;and&hellip;the rest happened. But Mrs. Jackson didn&rsquo;t get there for like 40 minutes because they were coming from the valley.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">I had a wheelchair, a Cardiologist and a social worker waiting for her so that she could &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t want to walk it &ndash; I know that she had a bad heart. I wanted that cardiologist to oversee her.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Wow&hellip;Uh, what is your role with Sony/ATV? Did you replace Raymone Bain or is she still on the board?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">No. Raymone Bain isn&rsquo;t on the board, Dr Tohme is not on the board. I&rsquo;m on the board of ATV/Sony music. I was put on there by Michael. He put myself on and Joel Katz who was his attorney at the time. That was the guy that he signed a letter of engagement with to bring him on as his counsel. So he wanted us both on the board because we were getting ready to have conversations with ATV/Sony to look into the expenditures and so on and so forth.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Do you work for AEG?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Never have and I don&rsquo;t now.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Okay.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Michael Jackson hired me. Michael Jackson was to pay me. AEG was to advance the money to pay me. At this point, I haven&rsquo;t been paid. I will be paid, you know, because we have to work this out but I&rsquo;m not on the payroll of AEG.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Exel</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Are you on good terms with the family and the estate?</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs31D24DEE">DiLeo</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I think I&rsquo;m on good terms with both.

There was nothing I did to deserve it. It wasn&rsquo;t because I was so cute, or brilliant, or talented. Out of the sky fell an opportunity to work for and learn from one of the greatest entertainers the world will ever know. So, I ate it up. I tried to do a fantastic job. Took it very, very seriously. So, in my mind there is this beautiful landscape; this film reel of singing before oceans of fans, amusement parks reserved for the band only, watching Michael dance from a couple feet away, and this burning, glowing, nova-like intensity. MJ was the most incredibly polite and tender human being I have ever met.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Bearden, &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; musical director, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://issuu.com/la_wattstimes/docs/lawt-6-24-10"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;L.A.

He asked me my opinion and I told him I liked it so far, but he didn&rsquo;t have any J5 or &lsquo;Off The Wall&rsquo; stuff on the list. He said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t?&rsquo; and grabbed it, looked at it and then balled it up. &hellip; We had a very difficult time trying to get that list together. If we did all of his hits, he would have been on the stage for about two weeks. &ldquo;What was great about the time we had together that day was seeing firsthand the love and passion he had for pleasing his fans and wanting to make sure they were getting what they wanted from our show.

With over 5,000 applications received, the number was narrowed down to 500 potential candidates, flying into California from all over America, and as far away as Australia, Canada, Japan, Europe, UK, and South America. They are some of the greatest dancers the world has to offer, and they were there for one reason - Michael!

He spends the next six hours on a soundstage in the company of 10 dancers and pop music&rsquo;s best-known choreographer.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The details of rehearsals for Jackson&rsquo;s upcoming concerts in London are closely held secrets, but what&rsquo;s at stake for him is not. The ambitious schedule of 50 sold-out shows could turn out to be the final, sad chapter of Jackson&rsquo;s storied career -- or one of pop music&rsquo;s all-time greatest comeback stories.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">When -- or if, in the view of many industry skeptics -- Jackson takes the stage at the O2 Arena July 8, it will be his first extended concert run in 12 years. Doubters cite his long hiatus from performing, health problems, a onetime prescription pill addiction, age -- he is 50 -- and his reputation for flaking out on performances and business deals.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">But the concert promoter, Los Angeles-based AEG Live, insists that Jackson is prepared mentally and physically and that the show, called &ldquo;This Is It,&rdquo; will break new ground in both artistry and sheer cost. The production budget is &ldquo;north of $20 million,&rdquo; a price tag that will include as many as 22 different sets, said Randy Phillips, the company&rsquo;s chief executive.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be the biggest, most technologically advanced arena show -- and the most expensive -- ever mounted,&rdquo; Phillips said.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">On Monday, the company announced that choreographer and director Kenny Ortega, the force behind the movie &ldquo;Dirty Dancing&rdquo; and the &ldquo;High School Musical&rdquo; series, as well as Jackson&rsquo;s Dangerous and HIStory tours, has signed on to direct and design the shows. Ortega agreed to work around his schedule as director of the planned remake of the 1984 movie &ldquo;Footloose&rdquo; to take on Jackson&rsquo;s shows, according to AEG.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">In a statement, Ortega called Jackson &ldquo;the greatest entertainer of our generation&rdquo; and said he was eager to collaborate with him again. &ldquo;My answer without a beat was nothing could keep me away,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">In Ortega, Jackson chose someone who has achieved what he could not -- continuous cultural relevance after great success in the 1980s. He tapped as the show&rsquo;s choreographer and associate director Travis Payne, who worked with Jackson in the mid-1990s. Payne&rsquo;s recent work includes routines for Beyonce and Madonna, as well as a &ldquo;Dancing With the Stars&rdquo; tribute to Jackson.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Also involved are younger choreographers who rose to prominence translating Jackson&rsquo;s style for a new generation. Todd Sams, who has worked with Usher, is collaborating on the show, according to a representative, and Rich &amp; Tone Talauega, a duo who have choreographed Chris Brown&rsquo;s moves, were present for auditions last month.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The two-day casting call drew 700 dancers to downtown Los Angeles&rsquo; Nokia Theatre. &ldquo;They were from the elite agencies across the world -- London, France, New York,&rdquo; said Australian dancer Nandy McClean, who was not chosen. &ldquo;There were hip-hop dancers and jazz dancers. You could tell a lot of them were crazy Michael Jackson fans who grew up watching him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">In the end, eight men and two women were selected. Jackson attended the second day of tryouts -- one agency head compared the experience to basketball players auditioning for Michael Jordan.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Dancing for an artist who is so amazing and who everyone looks up to was the best feeling of my life,&rdquo; said Atlanta dancer Victor Carter, who did not make the cut. &ldquo;He perfected the profession.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is taking a hands-on role in coming up with routines, according to Ortega and Phillips. The singer is developing a move that he hopes will be as distinctive as the moonwalk, Phillips said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s working on it,&rdquo; he said, refusing to say more: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sworn to secrecy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&hellip;[In regards to Michael&rsquo;s thin frame], AEG&rsquo;s Phillips said Jackson had &ldquo;filled out&rdquo; by last November, when discussions about the London concerts began. He said a four-hour physical with an independent physician this spring found no medical problems. In preparation for the shows, Jackson is doing aerobics with a personal trainer and has had no difficulty keeping up with dancers half his age during rehearsals in Burbank, Phillips said.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those practice sessions occur in secrecy, thanks to security patrols and confidentiality agreements. There have been rumors, especially in the British media, that the production will include a duet with Jackson&rsquo;s eldest son, Prince Michael, a stage filled with Jackson look-alikes, and a cast of monkeys and elephants.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Beyond denying the last report -- &ldquo;No animals. No animals!&rdquo; Phillips said -- producers are tight-lipped about what the 20,000 fans in the arena will see. Jackson will perform between 18 and 22 songs. Some choreography will feature aerial dancing similar to routines by Cirque du Soleil, he said.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The singer has said he will sing his hits, telling a March news conference, &ldquo;I will be performing the songs my fans want to hear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The concert preparation has not been spared the lawsuits and threats of suits that seem to be a given in any dealings with Jackson. Last week, he was sued by his former publicist and the actress who co-starred in the 1983 &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; video. On Monday, a New Jersey concert promoter sent a cease and desist letter, alleging the London appearances violated terms of an agreement to play a Jackson Five reunion concert.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Phillips said the claim was &ldquo;meritless&rdquo; and had not affected rehearsals.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="cs76EFAA84">&ldquo;Ticketmaster&rdquo; (May 20, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.mjjcommunity.com/forum/threads/63772-ANNOUNCEMENT-Rescheduling-of-The-This-Is-It-Opening-shows"><span class="cs8567212B">mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140414071902/https://www.mjjcommunity.com/forum/threads/63772-ANNOUNCEMENT-Rescheduling-of-The-This-Is-It-Opening-shows"><span class="cs8567212B">archived mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">This afternoon Michael Jackson show producers will be announcing the rescheduling and change of the opening shows in order to meet the challenges presented by such a large and technically complex concert.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Thanks for your understanding.

We look forward to seeing you on 13 July.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Due to the sheer magnitude of the &ldquo;This Is It&rdquo; concerts at the O2 Arena promoters and producers AEG Live and Kenny Ortega, Michael&rsquo;s directorial partner and creative collaborator have elected to move back a few of the opening shows in order to meet the challenges presented by such a massive and technically complex show.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Organisers are determined that all Michael&rsquo;s legions of fans attending the opening nights get the same quality of staging and level of entertainment. Only the four shows listed here are affected:</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&middot; 8th July will take place on 13th July 2009</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&middot; 10th July will be moved to 1st March 2010</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&middot; 12th July will be moved to 3rd March 2010</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&middot; 14th July will be moved to 6th March 2010</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Kenny and Michael are, at the same time, both creative pioneers and perfectionists. This show has grown in size and scope, thereby, necessitating more lead time for manufacture of the set, programming the content for the massive video elements, and, most importantly, more time for full production and dress rehearsals in the world&rsquo;s busiest arena, the O2. As much as we agonized over this change in the original schedule, we are sure the fans will understand when they experience the level of entertainment Michael Jackson intends to deliver while also ensuring the safety of the musicians, cast and crew and the crisp execution of the production. It is AEG Live&rsquo;s sincere hope that those lucky enough to have purchased tickets will have enough time to change their personal schedules and travel plans if they are coming from outside of London. We do not want anyone to miss this once-in-a-lifetime experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Michael, who is directly involved with all aspects of the styling/choreography/band selection and rehearsals, is working around the clock to ensure this is the show to end all shows!</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Kenny Ortega, Michael&rsquo;s directorial partner and creative collaborator said, &ldquo;After directing the Dangerous and HIStory tours, I know what the fans expect and myself and the team want to deliver a flawless production. We apologise to all disappointed Michael Jackson fans and remain extremely dedicated and focused on creating an exceptional live music experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2009-06-28-jackson-concerts_N.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;USA Today&rdquo; (June 28, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171227212554/https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2009-06-28-jackson-concerts_N.htm"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">A hovering orb, a flaming bed, mutant spiders, 20-foot puppets, 3-D effects, pyrotechnics and the return of the crooning, spinning, moonwalking King of Pop. Michael Jackson&#39;s farewell concert tour had every crowd-pleasing lure &mdash; but no crowds.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Fans had ponied up $85 million for 750,000 tickets to Jackson&#39;s 50 shows at London&#39;s O2 arena, a marathon swan song, aptly titled This Is It, that was scheduled to begin July 13. Instead, the final curtain fell Wednesday night at a rehearsal in Los Angeles&#39; Staples Center, where Jackson sang and danced for the last time.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">No applause. No screaming throng. No demands for encores. Only his crew and a few guests saw what would be the unheralded closing performance by one of history&#39;s greatest entertainers.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">...&quot;He was trying, and succeeding, in structuring the biggest, most spectacular live production ever seen,&quot; says Johnny Caswell, co-owner of CenterStaging in Burbank, Calif., where Jackson polished the show from late March to early June before shifting rehearsals to larger venues.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;By the time he left my facility, he had graduated through several studios and was on a soundstage taking up 10,000 square feet,&quot; Caswell says. &quot;They moved to The Forum, outgrew that and needed the height at Staples. The show was getting so damn big, they couldn&#39;t finish it in time. That&#39;s why they had to delay.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reports that the singer postponed the London start date by five days because of poor health were &quot;nonsense,&quot; Caswell says.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Wednesday at Staples, Jackson worked with his band, crew, choreographers and a dozen dancers, roughly 80 people total, to fine-tune what was expected to be his comeback after a 12-year absence from the tour circuit.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Back in the game</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s goal of returning to prominence seemed easily within reach to the few who saw Wednesday&#39;s rehearsal.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was energetic, passionate, diligent, prepared, excited and an effective leader,&quot; Caswell says, adding that Jackson was an inspiration to his crew. &quot;These folks followed him like he&#39;s the Pied Piper. He was a perfectionist. This guy was ready to go.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Says Ed Alonzo, the &quot;Misfit of Magic&quot; who created illusions for Britney Spears&#39; Circus tour and joined Jackson&#39;s show six weeks ago: &quot;It was an amazing show. The thing was just days away from being perfected. It was incredible. Even though it was just a walk-through with the dancers, his moves were dead-on &mdash; the same Michael Jackson we (saw) through the years in music videos.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Jackson kicked off what turned out to be his final rehearsal, he donned a headset microphone, strolled to an elevated platform and launched into his 1991 hit </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dangerous</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&mdash; first a cappella, then with the band.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He wasn&#39;t singing full-out, but he was singing,&quot; Alonzo says. &quot;They ran the number a couple of times and started to bring more props onstage that he looked at for the </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> number. Every song he was doing was not just singing, but surrounded by huge production &mdash; gigantic spiders and 20-foot puppets. I feel I was so blessed to see the only performance of this concert.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson appeared underweight but not sick, he says.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">When they hugged, &quot;he felt very thin,&quot; Alonzo says. &quot;Even the first time I met him, 20 years ago at Neverland (Jackson&#39;s ranch in Santa Barbara County, Calif.), he was thin. So it didn&#39;t strike me as odd, other than he seemed fragile. But his energy and the way he moved and spoke had a lot of impact. His soul didn&#39;t seem fragile at all. This is just a thin guy.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Longtime Grammy Awards producer Ken Ehrlich, summoned to Staples on Wednesday evening to meet with Jackson on their potential collaboration on a television project, likewise found Jackson upbeat and energetic, overseeing every aspect of the production from video footage to prop cues.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">After their discussion, Jackson invited Ehrlich to stick around for the rehearsal. &quot;Michael was ready,&quot; says Ehrlich, who had worked with Jackson on various projects and booked his performance at the 1988 Grammys.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The show wasn&#39;t all there yet, but it looked extremely creative,&quot; Ehrlich says. &quot;You could see how much thought had gone into it. There were impactful moments.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The 10 or 11 songs performed during the rehearsal unfolded in a casual setting, but Jackson occasionally unleashed the full force of his stage persona.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I&#39;ve seen him in rehearsal mode several times over the years,&quot; Ehrlich says. &quot;Michael is extremely methodical. He&#39;s not going to give it all until he knows he&#39;s got it all.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;But sometimes, he&#39;d jump into it, and it was really exciting. As he got more comfortable with the props and where the dancers were, he got more animated. This was a guy who did it all, and here he was doing it again.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&#39;He ... was electric&#39;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">In earlier rehearsals, Jackson had seemed restrained to some observers.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">But after worrying that the frail singer might not have the strength for the London shows, lighting designer Patrick Woodroffe was reassured after seeing Wednesday&#39;s preview.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He came on stage and was electric,&quot; he told BBC&#39;s Radio 4, describing the show as complicated and challenging. &quot;Suddenly he was performing as one had remembered him in the past.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Crewmembers were astonished by Jackson&#39;s talent, charisma and verve.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There was a sense we had actually seen this comeback that was so important to him,&quot; Woodroffe says. He says he wasn&#39;t sure Jackson would have lasted through the tour&#39;s March 6 finale, &quot;but he would have made it to the start of the race.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Frank DiLeo, Jackson&#39;s manager, told </span><span class="cs43C038A">The Hollywood Reporter</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> that after finishing the rehearsal sometime after midnight early Thursday, the singer expressed joy about the night&#39;s work.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He found me and said, &#39;Frank, I am so happy. ... This is really our time.&#39; He put his arm around me,&quot; DiLeo told the newspaper.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Alonzo had designed dazzling effects for the show, including a glass sphere that would float around Jackson during the opening song, 1982&#39;s </span><span class="cs43C038A">Wanna Be Startin&#39; Somethin&#39;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The globe was designed to light up and grow brighter as it drifted over the crowd before landing in Jackson&#39;s palm. Jackson&#39;s instructions, according to Alonzo: &quot;I want people to scream for miles.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">For a splashy version of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Dirty Diana</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, Jackson wanted a flaming bed with a pole-dancing aerialist &quot;playing the part of the fire,&quot; Alonzo says.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">The elaborately plotted stunt: Jackson intended to be pursued around the bed by the &quot;fire woman,&quot; and each time she touched the stage, flames in the form of fluttering crimson fabric would shoot skyward.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">After she caught him, she would lash him to the bed&#39;s tall posts with gold rope and a sheet of red fabric would billow before him, illuminating his struggling silhouette.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">When the sheet fell, the magic trick would be triggered &mdash; the woman would be revealed as the one ensnared, and Jackson would materialize on a stage in the center of the arena.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Grieving fans, huge losses</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Details of Jackson&#39;s extravaganza have been scarce because all parties involved were required to sign non-disclosure agreements.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now fans are gleaning clues about what would have been a towering spectacle that&#39;s being dismantled as its creator is mourned around the world. (Refund details for those who bought tickets &mdash; which cost 50 to 75 pounds, or $69 to $103, when they went on sale, according to </span><span class="cs43C038A">Billboard</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&mdash; will be announced this week.)</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wednesday&#39;s rehearsal was videotaped, but it&#39;s unclear whether Jackson&#39;s performance will be made public, such as through the sale of a DVD.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">Caswell, crushed that Jackson&#39;s camp didn&#39;t allow the CenterStaging rehearsals to be filmed, says the show&#39;s death means heartbroken fans, huge losses for promoters and a missed opportunity to remind the world of Jackson&#39;s talent. He sees a solution in a stage bromide: The show must go on.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I would do the concert as a tribute to Michael,&quot; he says.</span></p><p class="cs599D93C8"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Do every song with a different major artist. Film it and put it in IMAX theaters. Then box it up and sell it for the next 30 years.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">When questioned on the heavy schedule of the dates Phillips said:</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s condition to agreeing to the extra dates was that he got the Guinness Book of World Records to document his 50-show feat and rent him a sprawling country home outside London for his children.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">Upon selling all the shows out, Phillips spoke of Michael&rsquo;s delight over the telephone.</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;He was crying. I could hear it in his voice &ndash; he was choked up.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs276A8786"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p></body>
