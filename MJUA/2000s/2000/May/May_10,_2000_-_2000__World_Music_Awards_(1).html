A thousand years from now, when the history of popular music is examined, no single performer will be as remembered and celebrated as Michael Jackson. It&#39;s rare for a child performer to be successful in his adult career and then still for that career to take off into the stratosphere as Michael&#39;s did. And at the close of the century he has sold more records around the world than any single artist in the history of the medium. His influential song &quot;We Are The World&quot; and his international Heal The World Foundation are just two of his many charitable efforts that have raised millions of dollars for hundreds of important causes. Simply put, Michael Jackson&#39;s influence on entertainment, on charity and in fact our entire culture is absolutely immeasurable. As we enter the 21st century, we can look forward to even more outstanding achievements in music and feature films from this incredibly talented artist. It&rsquo;s been a privilege to witness Michael&#39;s dazzling journey over the years which has transformed him from a singer to a superstar and from a charming little boy to a dignified man.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Video intro to Childhood and Beat It.

I love you more. And I&rsquo;m so proud to thank.. I thank God, and I&#39;m so proud that God gave me the gift of song. And the world gave me the opportunity to be heard through music.
