		<p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Heal the Kids&quot; Launch</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Jonathan Margolis, journalist (visit was Mid-Late November 2000) [from March 11, 2001 Report]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I saw him there working tirelessly on planning Heal The Kids, which will &#39;campaign globally for parents to spend quality time with their children&#39;.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He did this despite being under pressure from his record company to get on with recording his album, his first new music in nearly a decade.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I saw him in conversation and holding his own with child psychiatrists, bankers, writers and society bigwigs, and assured and informal on a conference call with actor Denzel Washington and Nelson Mandela, whom he asked to join the Heal The Kids board. (&#39;I&#39;ll do whatever you want, Michael,&#39; Mandela said. &#39;You know how I respect you.&#39;) I also listened to Jackson in business meetings, where a different man still emerged - focused, numerate, business-savvy and imaginative.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Abby Ellin, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/my-surreal-night-with-michael-jackson"><span class="cs8567212B">The Daily Beast</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Wanna meet Michael Jackson?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was one of the strangest questions I&rsquo;ve ever received, and it came from the most unlikely source: Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, he of the &ldquo;Kosher&rdquo; (Sex, Sutra, Adultery) line of books. It was November 2000, Boteach&rsquo;s 34th birthday, and he was inviting a couple of his favorite folks to his New Jersey manse to meet the Artist of the Millennium. And oh yes, the unlikely duo&mdash;they&rsquo;d met in 1999, and Boteach fancied himself Jackson&rsquo;s &quot;spiritual adviser&quot;&mdash;were going to unveil their charity, aptly named Heal the Kids. Was I interested in joining them for dinner?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Uh, yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On the appointed evening I arrived in Englewood, New Jersey, where Boteach and his gaggle of offspring dwell. About 25 of us&mdash;including publishing notable Judith Regan, fitness guru Oz Garcia, hedge-fund titan Michael Steinhardt, and future Newark Mayor Cory Booker, another Boteach pal&mdash;chatted among ourselves, sipping (kosher) wine and trying to play it cool. But who were we kidding? We were not remotely interested in each other; we were waiting for the Gloved One, and we knew it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just then there was a rustling under the table and Jackson lifted the tablecloth. &ldquo;Oh, look!&rdquo; he squealed. &ldquo;A doggie!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&rsquo;m not sure when He actually walked in; all I know is that at one point I glanced back and saw Boteach shepherding a slight, slim-hipped woman with shoulder-length black hair around the room. She was wearing a purplish button-down shirt and black trousers, and people seemed very happy to meet her. And then she swiveled and I realized that this woman was, in fact, the Man himself, the dude whose &ldquo;Shake Your Body Down to the Ground&rdquo; blasted at the first boy/girl party I&rsquo;d even attended, circa 1980. A pair of black sunglasses perched on his sliver of a nose, which had a tiny Band-Aid across it. Sparse patches of hair dotted his chin and upper lip. Other than those dark specks, however, his skin was translucent. He looked like he&rsquo;d just stepped out of Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I waited for Boteach and his charge to make their way over to me, but that never happened. Why would it? I was but a lowly journalist whose mission, I soon learned, was to document the evening, and spread the word about Heal the Kids. I didn&rsquo;t need to actually meet Michael.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Soon we headed into the dining room. There were three tables set up for the adults, and a kid&rsquo;s table in an adjacent room. That&rsquo;s where Boteach&rsquo;s brood sat, along with Jackson&rsquo;s kids&mdash;towhead toddlers Paris and Prince, who were dressed like little Victorian dolls. The Jackson Two were clearly Caucasian, yet they did seem to share some of Jackson&rsquo;s features. I wondered: Was it possible he really was their biological father? Can vitiligo be transmitted in utero?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was seated with Boteach&rsquo;s wife, Deborah; a journalist from England; and one other Nobody. Jackson was supposed to sit at a long table to my right, but there was a glitch: He wanted to hang with the kids instead. A summit ensued, with Boteach and Jackson&rsquo;s entourage speaking in hushed tones: How could they get him to play nice with the grownups?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Somehow they succeeded and the meal began, the guests surreptitiously eyeing Jackson, who had not removed his sunglasses (or Band-Aid). I had still not been introduced, and I was annoyed. Finally, there was a vacancy next to him. I sidled over.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; I said, plopping down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Abby, and I&rsquo;ve been wanting to ask you this since I was 12 years old. What does Mamma-Say&mdash;Mamma Sah&mdash;Mamma-Coo-Sa mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He laughed, a high-pitched chirp that sounded like a castrato. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the second person in my entire career to ask me that!&rdquo; he trilled. &ldquo;It means, &#39;I need you, l love you, I want you&rsquo; in Swahili. It fit the song, so I added it in.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wow! The secret hidden message in &ldquo;Wanna Be Startin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo;&rdquo;! This was important information! Made perfect sense to me. I don&#39;t speak Swahili, so what did I know? (I have since tried to confirm this translation with native Kenyans&mdash;who presumably would know&mdash;and they looked at me like I had five heads.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Then we started talking about Africa. He said he had just returned.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Were you on safari?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He shook his head. No, he was in Johannesburg with friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Johannesburg,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It scared me.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;It did? Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I told him I didn&rsquo;t feel safe walking down the street, it seemed very violent. &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He chuckled, with more than a touch of sadness. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk down the street anywhere,&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Good point.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We bantered a bit more&mdash;I asked him why he was wearing his shades inside, and he said his eyes were bloodshot from traveling so much, and I asked him why his kids&rsquo; hair was so light. &ldquo;Their mother&rsquo;s a platinum blonde,&rdquo; he explained.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Just then there was a rustling under the table and Jackson lifted the tablecloth and peered underneath. &quot;Oh, look!&quot; he squealed. &quot;A doggie!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And then I found myself uttering six words I never imagined would burst from my lips: &ldquo; Do you have animals at Neverland?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&quot; he said. &ldquo;Lions and elephants and chimps and giraffes! All kinds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Animals are the best,&quot; I said.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;No,&rdquo; he corrected me, and I swear, his voice lowered a few octaves. &quot;Kids are the best.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Boteach motioned for me to return to my seat. My time was up, but the evening wasn&rsquo;t. A late thirty-ish woman stood and introduced herself as a single mother of four children, one of whom had a rare form of cancer. The woman talked of her hardships, of the traumas her daughter experienced, of chemo and radiation. As she spoke, small yelps filled the room: It was Jackson, bawling&mdash; howling&mdash;into his linen napkin. The longer the woman talked, the louder Jackson&rsquo;s sobs grew, like a 6-year-old who had just been banned from his Wii. Apparently this woman&rsquo;s pain was just too much for him to bear. Naturally, everyone ignored him: So a grown man&rsquo;s wailing into his napkin. Big deal! Happens every day.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After that, we trudged into the living room, and Jackson sat on the couch with Boteach&rsquo;s kids. (His own kids were with the nanny.) Someone hauled in a large cardboard box, a gift from Jackson: A new TV! Then everyone&mdash;Jackson included&mdash;sang &ldquo;Happy Birthday,&rdquo; and someone else put &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; on the stereo and it was festive and happy and totally surreal.</span></p></body>
