Pudney, in the first official</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">confirmation of the deal, says of Jackson: &quot;His whole new thrust is going to be films. He</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">has sold the most records, made the most money on tours, and this is the one genre he has</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the desire to excel in.&quot; Jackson is deeply interested as always in the technical aspects</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">of the project. A major makeup job will turn him into Poe, and the ad campaign &quot;will be</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">based on his image morphing into Poe through technology,&quot; Pudney says.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, Jackson is at his California ranch, wrapping his new album for Sony, due out</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">this spring.

He&#39;s enthusiastic about this &quot;very scary&quot; movie, and after his Sony single comes out at Christmas and his new album in January, he&#39;ll devote himself full time to preparing for the role.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">That&#39;s the word from Jackson&#39;s co-executive producer, Gary Pudney. &quot;Michael says by the time he&#39;s done preparing for this, the audience isn&#39;t even going to know it&#39;s him, with the major makeup. The new Michael is Michael Jackson, the movie actor. That is what he wants to devote his energies to,&quot; Pudney says, adding that the new album could be Jackson&#39;s last.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nightmares isn&#39;t a musical, but Jackson will write a song he&#39;ll perform over the titles, based on Poe&#39;s poetry. He also plans to visit Baltimore sites associated with Poe. The author died in that city.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The script has characters from the writer&#39;s works coming back to haunt Poe the last week of his life. It ends with Poe&#39;s death, and Jackson gets &quot;a great death scene.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The goal now is finding a director. &quot;Michael had conversations with Steven Spielberg, who is a good friend,&quot; Pudney says. &quot;Spielberg was enthusiastic and suggested several people, including Tim Burton, who did Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is Jackson&#39;s first feature film lead role. His only other theatrical release was the 1978 musical The Wiz with Diana Ross. He also starred in Captain Eo, a 3-D space adventure that began showing at Disneyland and Disney World in 1986 and ran for about 10 years.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Gary L.

Pudney has spoken about Michael Jackson&#39;s plans for his film &#39;The Nightmare Of Edgar Allen Poe&#39; and about the new album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reportedly, &quot;Michael Jackson will move to Montreal with his two children in early 2001 to prepare for the shooting of his long-planned movie.&quot; Production is to begin in March and Michael will act in the leading role and also will be executive producer, with Gary Pudney and Jim Green. Gary Pudney told columnist Marilyn Beck &quot;&quot;Michael&#39;s not going to look exactly like Poe, but you won&#39;t be able to tell the difference between them 10 minutes into the picture, it&#39;s going to be absolutely spectacular, full of gruesome goodies - and concluding with all the ghosts Poe wrote about coming back to haunt him at the end of his life. We&#39;ll also be hiring six to eight other incredible actors to help bring Michael up to snuff, he&#39;ll have an acting coach prior to production and during shooting.&quot; Michael is currently writing the theme song, which he will sing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Reportedly, the new album &quot;has been rescheduled for a January release. It could be his last for a while.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Gary Pudney concluded &quot;He wants to concentrate on films, we&#39;re already planning on more Poe films, and there are one or two other pictures we are also talking about doing. Michael is wired into the hierarchy of Hollywood - people like Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he wants to work - and vice versa.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Chris Cadman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Maestro&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one other really big part &ndash; the person who tells the story &ndash; and we&rsquo;re thinking of Jeremy Irons for that. We&rsquo;ll also be hiring six to eight incredible actors to help bring Michael up to snuff. He&rsquo;ll have an acting coach prior to production and during shooting.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
