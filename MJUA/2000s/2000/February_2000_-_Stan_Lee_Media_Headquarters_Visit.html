According to Paul, &quot;After we built SLM into a public company with a market cap almost twice Marvel&#39;s, we talked with Michael Jackson about teaming up to buy Marvel. I have a videotape of Michael in our offices for over two hours, seeing what we were doing.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, who was an avowed fan of Lee&#39;s work at Marvel, was reportedly interested and sat down with Lee and Paul to discuss the possibilities.

I&#39;ll be here.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson retained the services of investment banking firm Wasserstein-Perrella to negotiate with Perlmutter, but according to Paul, the Marvel owner was unwilling to take less than $1 billion for the company, and Jackson&#39;s zeal eventually faded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Google Video description of Stan Lee Media footage (October 27, 2006) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="http://tributomj.com/blog01/tag/stan-lee/"><span class="cs8567212B">Mirror</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Exclusive video of Michael Jackson visiting Stan Lee Media Squnkqurx animation studio in February, 2000. Jackson, Peter F Paul and Stan Lee discussed joint venturing Jackson&#39;s entertainment activities with Stan Lee&#39;s 100 man studio while working together to buy Marvel Entertainment. Stan Lee Media was valued at $370 million then, twice the value of Marvel. At the end of the video Stan Lee tells Michael Jackson that Peter Paul could be as great a help to building Michael&#39;s company as he was in building Stan&#39;s company. Four months later Paul arranged with President Bill Clinton to come and work with Paul and Lee after he left the White House in 2001 as a Rainmaker for their global expansion.(see www.hillcap.org)This resulted in the largest campaign fraud on record by the Clintons and a $100 million civil fraud suit against the Clintons by Paul.</span></p></body>
