Thank you Shmuley, thank you so much for making this evening possible for me and for all the important and meaningful projects that we have begun together.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Shmuley is also responsible for bringing me together with some of my special guests this evening, Nobel Prize winner, Professor Elie Wiesel and childrens&rsquo; expert, Dr Stanley Greenspan.

It&rsquo;s great to meet you guys and it&rsquo;s an honour to receive this award, not only did you make all the girls scream, but I was also thrilled to learn that you are continuing the tradition that I also believe in, in using your accomplishments to help others with your own charitable foundation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cancer is the number one killer of children. And it is only when we join together on evenings like this, that we can summon the courage and determination to stop it from ever robbing another child of the precious gift of life or a parent of the joy of watching their child grow. God bless you all for all the love and support you have offered this evening and I love you all very much. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p></body>
