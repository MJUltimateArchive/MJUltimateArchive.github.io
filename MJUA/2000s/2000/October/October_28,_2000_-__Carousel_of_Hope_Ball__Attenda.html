Marvin still couldn&rsquo;t get over the ball&rsquo;s finale when he saw wife Barbara on stage shaking it with Ricky Martin &mdash; who had the entire ballroom on its feet dancing. Barbara had also told Michael Jackson, &ldquo;Ricky wants to meet you.&rdquo; So Jackson and his date Elizabeth Taylor made their way backstage with Barbara, who shoved Michael onstage for a brief moment in the spotlight with the new king, Ricky Martin. Martin had flown in from Australia with his entire troupe to perform gratis, as did the other artists... Jackson and Taylor, who were sitting directly in front of our table&hellip; engaged in conversation during Ricky&rsquo;s first two numbers. Jackson&rsquo;s doctor, dermatologist Arnold Klein; had sidled up to talk with them during Martin&rsquo;s performance. Jackson and his children have been regular (biweekly) visitors at the Davis&rsquo; home and the offspring get high marks from Marvin. John Davis had birthday-gifted dad Marvin with two tiny donkeys which graze on the lush lawn; the celeb lunch bunch had a full view of the tiny critters who have free rein (and you know what that includes) of the garden &hellip; At the BevHilton, Elizabeth and Michael were seated at one end of the head table on the first riser and in full view of the crowd below. As you might imagine, their presence created a major crush of visitors; some like Shirley MacLaine and Carrie Fisher (who just toiled with Taylor in &ldquo;Those Old Broads&rdquo;) carried on their conversation on the carpeting alongside Elizabeth. Another of the &ldquo;Broads,&rdquo; Joan Collins, was seated elsewhere with Evie and Leslie Bricusse. Collins is off to England to be at daughter Tara Newley&rsquo;s side during her divorce battle. Joan is no stranger to that stage.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It was no secret that Ricky Martin, while the toast of the (young) world, was nervous about appearing before this mature, star-studded audience of performers and execs. He needn&rsquo;t have been! Sure, he&rsquo;s had movie offers but can&rsquo;t accept because of the time they&rsquo;d take away from his concerts and recordings. He winged out (in his plane) immediately after the BevHilton benefit to Miami &hellip; Performers at future BevHilton events will be pleased to know that Merv Griffin, the Carousel Ball&rsquo;s host, has built a new backstage facility for talent. It was appreciated by the magnificent performers Toni Braxton (who said her mother has diabetes), young Charlotte Church (whatta voice!), David Foster and the musicians. Jay Leno&rsquo;s takeoff tape on candidates Gore and Bush was classic, but his remarks about President Clinton are getting to be overdone by now. Touching moments were the remarks by Barbara Davis, daughter Dana (and the presentation of a hand receiving the brass ring sculpture) and Sidney Poitier. George Schlatter did a terrif job again producing the show &hellip; Clive Davis, one of the music chairmen, just signed Luther Vandross and O-Town to his new J Records and has now added a young duo from Brazil: Medeiros, brothers Julian and Rodalgo M. who sing in Portuguese, Spanish and English. Attending with Davis was his cousin Jo Schuman Silver, owner of SanFran&rsquo;s fantastic &ldquo;Beach Blanket Babylon&rdquo; show, which continues SRO for every performance &hellip; Among those who stopped by to hug Michael Jackson was Berry Gordy, his discoverer. Also Suzanne De Passe. Also there Keely Shaye Smith and Pierce Brosnan, who told me he doesn&rsquo;t expect to be away at work when their baby arrives in February. And they probably will not have the wedding until summer, in Ireland &hellip; As always, the Carousel Ball featured a silent auction which preceded in the BevHilton&rsquo;s rooms surrounding the lobby and ballroom. Dana Davis and sister Nancy Davis-Rickel again chaired and the auction brought in $623,389 &mdash; to date. They are still selling items. Celebrity-designed plates brought in $56,700. Guests included Line Renaud, just in from Paris. She arrived with Veronique and Gregory Peck (he contributed one of the designed plates). Neil Diamond even bought a painting by LeRoy Neiman, which he had contributed &hellip; Marvin Davis, whose properties over the years have included 20th Century Fox and the Beverly Hills Hotel, has a new affiliation with Lend Lease with plans to build everything &ldquo;all over the world.&rdquo; Meanwhile the Davises continue to build to one day find a cure for childhood diabetes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-oct-31-cl-44464-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Los Angeles Times&rdquo; (October 31, 2000)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190702175944/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-oct-31-cl-44464-story.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One would have been hard put to rent a limo on Saturday night. The armada seemed endless as it rolled under the Beverly Hilton&#39;s porte-cochere for the 14th biennial Carousel of Hope Ball to benefit the Denver-based Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">It happens here every two years in October, and it&#39;s always a paparazzi feeding frenzy that rivals Oscar night. The glare from jewels, sequins, chemically enhanced smiles and flashing cameras is enough to cause temporary blindness.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This bash is the equivalent of a royal command performance. The queen of the event, Barbara Davis, held court this time in a fairy godmother cloud of pink tulle set off with a triple strand of jawbreaker pearls, and a Judith Leiber &quot;carousel&quot; minaudiere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson came late and slipped in through a kitchen door to join the Davis&#39; table. Prior to dinner, Poitier, U.S. Postmaster Gen. William Henderson, Larry King and Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall, who is diabetic, gathered with the Davis family in the hotel&#39;s Rodeo Room to unveil the new &quot;Know More About Diabetes&quot; postage stamp to be released in March 2001.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Following dinner and dessert--individual baked Alaskas topped with a fondant carousel horse--the young Welsh thrush Charlotte Church and Toni Braxton entertained along with Ricky Martin, who had Barbara Davis dancing on the stage and many more dancing in the aisles to &quot;Livin&#39; la Vida Loca.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As guests headed for their cars, Chrissy Lerner, executive director of the Children&#39;s Diabetes Foundation, dispensed Guess tote bags packed with &quot;free stuff&quot; and doughnuts for the ride home. &quot;Not everyone has to avoid sugar,&quot; she said with a wink.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://ew.com/article/2000/11/10/carousel-hope/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Entertainment Weekly&rdquo; (November 10, 2000)</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290"> (<a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190702180804/https://ew.com/article/2000/11/10/carousel-hope/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="csD5D7D290">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&rdquo;We&rsquo;re definitely ready to shake our bon-bons.&rdquo; So piped</span><span class="cs43C038A"> Will &amp; Grace</span><span class="csD5D7D290">&lsquo;s Sean Hayes, one of the many stars on hand to see Ricky Martin bring down the house at the Oct. 28 Carousel of Hope ball, L.A.&rsquo;s semiannual fund-raiser for childhood diabetes. The benefit at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, hosted by philanthropists Marvin and Barbara Davis, raised more than $6 million and drew perhaps the most eclectic group of famous faces this side of the Betty Ford Center. Just check out table 116 for proof: Invited by the Davises to join them at the &rdquo;captain&rsquo;s table&rdquo; were President Gerald and Betty Ford, Sylvester Stallone, Sir Sidney Poitier, Mark Wahlberg, a solo Dennis Quaid, Jay Leno, Dustin Hoffman, and Dame Elizabeth Taylor with date Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...Just as eclectic was the silent auction, which offered 40 collectible plates decorated by celebs like Angelina Jolie, Sir Sean Connery, and Clint Eastwood (opening bid for each: $250) [including] a profile of a [child] sketched by Jackson. The after-dinner concert featured spirited performances by Martin, Toni Braxton, and Charlotte Church, but the evening&rsquo;s most entertaining turn may have been the crowd&rsquo;s naughty, wink-wink interpretation of President Clinton&rsquo;s pretaped speech, which was sprinkled with unintentional double entendres. (Emcee Leno began the ribaldry by suggesting that Bubba&rsquo;s last-minute cancellation may not have been business-related.) Guffaws were especially loud after the no-show Commander in Briefs explained he had to be &rdquo;on the job&rdquo; and plugged for Hillary&rsquo;s &rdquo;pushing all the way&rdquo; on health care.</span></p></body>
