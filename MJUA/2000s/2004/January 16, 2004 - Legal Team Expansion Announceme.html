My friend Benjamin Brafman will serve with me as co-lead counsel effective immediately.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and I agreed that expanding the team would best serve his interests as we work toward his acquittal on the false charges that have been leveled against him. I felt strongly about working with Ben, someone I have long respected and admired. Ben will join me tomorrow in Santa Maria at Michael&rsquo;s arraignment where Michael will enter a plea of not guilty.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ben is a principal in the law firm of Brafman &amp; Ross based in Manhattan.

Whatever anybody says about Michael, it takes a heck of an athlete to make that jump from the ground up to the top of the SUV. And I was using a few choice words about getting him back down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But he knew what he was doing, and after that I ran into the judge.
