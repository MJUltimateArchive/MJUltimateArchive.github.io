We are all bitched from the start and you especially</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">have to be hurt like hell before you can write seriously. But when you get the damned</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">hurt, use it-don&#39;t cheat with it. Be as faithful to it as a scientist-but don&#39;t think</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">anything is of any importance because it happens to you or anyone belonging to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Those words of advice, quoted in Robert Evans&#39;s The Kid Stays in the Picture, were</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">given to F. Scott Fitzgerald by Hemingway, some 70 years ago. They are as relevant</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">today as ever.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking of life&#39;s desires, hurts, and euphoria! It ain&#39;t easy being a genius: You do pay</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the price, not unlike Mozart, who will be remembered far longer than Napoleon.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson understands this irony. No one I have ever met in my life has had</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">such passion and love for entertainment. His work, brilliance, and vision will be</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">remembered far longer than any of those who now think of him harshly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael and I have shared many a day, week, and month together. Our relationship is</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">based on our love of films. We have watched many films together, and our personal</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">favorite that we enjoy most is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory! A few months</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">before the latest drama, he and I were on a little vacation. In the past he has often put</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">a video camera to my face and asked me questions. This is what Michael does with</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">his friends: He becomes a scientist and dissects them through questions in order to learn. Many times he has asked me how my childhood dreams became a reality, about</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">why I wanted to become a director. So I decided it was time to hear from him about</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">his childhood dreams.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">After my interview, I went out and bought all the records he mentioned and listened to</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">them, understanding a little more about Michael. What you are about to read is a very</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">private and personal conversation between two friends.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Brett Ratner: Do you have a mentor or someone who inspired you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: Yeah, I do: Berry Gordy, Diana Ross, Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, James Brown, Jackie Wilson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: And what did you learn from them?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I learned a lot from them--about how to be a visionary, how to be creative, how to be persistent, how to be determined, how to have a will of iron and to never give up no matter what. You know?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What was your first job in the music industry, and how did you get it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: First job, probably ... Gee, I don&#39;t remember back that far. I was around 6 years old. Maybe it was Mr. Lucky&#39;s. I think it was a club--yeah, Mr. Lucky&#39;s. We performed there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: And how&#39;d you get the job?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I don&#39;t know; my father would know. I was too little.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What was your first break and the first great thing that ever happened to you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: The real big break was when Motown signed us. We auditioned in Detroit, and Berry Gordy invited all our favorite stars that we saw as kids to this little town in Indiana: Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles, the Temptations, and Stevie Wonder--everybody was there. And it was next to this indoor pool at this huge mansion, marble everywhere. We performed, and they just went crazy. They loved it. And [Gordy] says, &quot;Boys, you&#39;re signed.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Really?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: And you remember that day?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Oh, I remember it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What elements of your job make you want to go to work every day?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I want to work every day--just the idea of creating worlds. It&#39;s like taking a canvas, an empty canvas, you know, a clean slate. They give you paint, and we just color and paint and create worlds. I just love that idea. Anything. And having people see it and be awe-inspired whenever they see it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What qualities of yours helped you get where you are today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Faith and determination. And practice.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Right. Practice makes perfect. What would you have done differently in your career if you knew then what you know now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: What would I have done differently? Let me see ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: If you knew what you know now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, I know. Practice more.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Practice more?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I practiced a lot.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: You practiced a hell of a lot! [JACKSON LAUGHS] But you would have practiced more? [JACKSON NODS] What&#39;s your greatest lesson learned?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Not to trust everybody. Not to trust everybody in the industry. There&#39;re a lot of sharks. And record companies steal. They cheat. You have to audit them. And it&#39;s time for artists to take a stand against them, because they totally take advantage of [ARTISTS]. Totally. They forget that it&#39;s the artists who make the company, not the company who makes the artists. Without the talent, the company would be nothing but just hardware, I mean just, you know. And it takes a real good talent that the public wants to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What are some of your favorite albums?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: My favorite albums would be Tchaikovsky&#39;s Nutcracker Suite, Claude Debussy&#39;s greatest hits, which is, you know, &quot;Claire de Lune&quot; and &quot;Arabesque&quot; and The Afternoon of a Faun. I love Marvin Gaye&#39;s What&#39;s Going On, James Brown&#39;s Live at the Apollo, The Sound of Music [SOUNDTRACK]. I love Rodgers and Hammerstein. I love the great show-tune writers very much, and I love Holland-Dozier-Holland from Motown--they were geniuses. So many great writers. So many great ones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Any other great albums, like contemporary albums?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Great albums ... It&#39;s hard because albums today have one or two great songs and the rest stink.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Or older style---it could be like Marvin Gaye or Sly.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Sly &amp; the Family Stone--I like everything they do. Stevie Wonder is a genius.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Which album?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Every one. Talking Book. I love when he did &quot;Living for the City.&quot; I forget the name of it [THE ALBUM]. Fantastic. I think that was song In the key of life --fantastic. Hearing this music made me say to myself, &quot;I can do this, and I think I can do this on an international level.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Really?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Really, and then when the Bee Gees came out in the &#39;70s, that did it for me. I cried. I cried listening to their music. I knew every note, every instrument.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: [SINGS] &quot;This broken heart ...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: [SINGS] &quot;How can you mend ...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: [SINGS] &quot;This broken heart ...&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: And [SINGS] &quot;How can you stop the rain from falling down?&quot; I love that. [SINGS WITH RATNER] &quot;How can you stop the sun from shining? That&rsquo;s it. What makes the world go &#39;round.&quot; I love that stuff. And when they did Saturday Night Fever, that did it for me. I said, &quot;I gotta do this. I gotta do this. I know I can do this.&quot; And we hit with Thriller. And I just started writing songs. I wrote &quot;Billie Jean.&quot; I wrote &quot;Beat It,&quot; &quot;Startin&#39; Somethin&#39;.&quot; Just writing, writing. It was fun.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Any posters up in your room when you were a kid and of who?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah. Brooke Shields, everywhere. My sisters would get jealous and tear them off the wall.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Really? Brooke Shields? O.k</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What are the great shows that you&#39;ve seen, concerts or even just shows?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: James Brown. Jackie Wilson. The real entertainers, the real ones, make you get goose bumps.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: It was James Brown? Where? Where&#39;d you see him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: We used to have to go onstage after him because he would come on and then we would come on amateur hour. So I&#39;d be in the wings studying every step, every move--</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: --On TV? On a TV show?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No, at the Apollo [THEATER].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Amateur Hour at the Apollo. And you saw him perform?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, and Jackie Wilson. All of them--the Delphonics, the Temptations.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: But do you remember one show? You saw the Temptations, too?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: But was there a show when you said like, &quot;Oh, my God&quot;?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: James Brown, Jackie Wilson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: At the Apollo?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, they made me cry. I&#39;ve never seen nothing like that. That kind of emotion, that kind of fever, feeling--it was like another higher, spiritual plane they were on. They were, like, in a trance, and they had the audience in the palms of their hands. I just loved how they could control them like that, that kind of power. When they&#39;d sing they&#39;d have tears running down their faces. They&#39;d get so into it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: What are some of your favorite songs?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Favorite songs of all time? I love Burt Bacharach very much. Any Motown. The Beatles, like &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; &quot;Yesterday.&quot; Any of the Supremes&#39;. All that stuff is great. I think the &#39;60s had some of the best melodies of all time between Peter, Paul, and Mary, and you know, all those people. The Mamas and the Papas were wonderful. And the Drifters go a little further back, but I love that song &quot;On Broadway&quot;--it&#39;s genius. The simple ones are the best, I think. I love &quot;Alfie&quot;&mdash;you know, so beautiful. There are so many. Like movies, there are so many great movies.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: So list a few things that could be helpful to someone breaking into the music business.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Believe in yourself. Study the greats and become greater. And be a scientist. Dissect. Dissect.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: When you said it before you said something else: Don&#39;t give up? No, what did you say? I don&rsquo;t remember.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: No matter what. I don&#39;t care if the whole world is against you or teasing you or saying you&#39;re not gonna make it. Believe in yourself. No matter what. Some of the greatest men who have made their mark on this world were treated like that--you know, &quot;You&#39;re not gonna do it, you&#39;re not gonna get anywhere.&quot; They laughed at the Wright brothers. They laughed at Thomas Edison. They laughed at Walt Disney. They made jokes about Henry Ford. They said he was ignorant. He didn&rsquo;t have college degree &lsquo;cause he dropped out of school. Disney dropped out of school. They would took forward to court to prove he&rsquo;s intelligent. That&#39;s how far they went. These men shaped and changed our culture, our customs, the way we live, the way we do things. And I think God plants those seeds through people on the earth. And I think you&#39;re one, I&#39;m one to bring some bliss and escapism, some joy, some magic. Because without entertainment, what would the world be like? You know? What would it really be like? It would be a totally different world for me. I love entertainment. And my favorite of all is film. The power and magic of movies. It&#39;s the greatest, it&#39;s the most expressive of all the art forms. I think it touches the soul. Music and movies are the most expressive. It&#39;s almost like religion: You get so involved, so caught up. You go in the theater a different person than you come out. It affects you that way. That&#39;s powerful. That&#39;s powerful. I think that&#39;s strong. I love that. And you got them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Make them feel a certain way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: They relate to it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah, they live it. They&#39;re a part of it. They forget they&#39;re sitting in a seat.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: The experience of watching a movie affects their life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Their whole life. It could change your life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Yes, I remember seeing Star Wars in the theater when I was 7 years old. It&#39;s a different experience for Paris or Prince [JACKSON&#39;S CHILDREN] seeing it. You know it&rsquo;s amazing, I mean it&rsquo;s the same movie. At the moment when you&rsquo;re in certain age and when you see what it&rsquo;s going on in the world at that time and it&rsquo;s the first time you ever see something like that it&rsquo;s live movie affects you, it&rsquo;s just like listening and hearing a song or seeing an artist perform, getting to see James Brown and that moment of tears coming out of your eyes it&rsquo;s different. Yeah, it&rsquo;s amazing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I can&#39;t tell you how incredible it was. I just love the great entertainers, the great performers, the great showmen, the great storytellers. Just watching them, you&#39;re just mesmerized. You&#39;re caught up in it. I love it. One spotlight, baby.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR: Yeah, Frank Sinatra.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yeah. Those guys are cool. And Sammy Davis. I just love it, the whole thing. It&#39;s magic, it&#39;s real magic.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">BR. What about James Brown in the Hot Top? Hot Top!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: That&rsquo;s great.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Brett Ratner, comment on &ldquo;The Shooter Series&rdquo; website (September 5, 2009) (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091002115455/http://shooterseries.squarespace.com/blog/2009/9/1/brett-ratner-interviews-michael-jackson.html"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To those people curious about if Michael was aware that the video camera was filming:</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Several years ago Michael and I were in Florida vacationing and, early one morning Michael came into my room with HIS video camera and started to film and ask questions about my life and why i dreamed of becoming a director. He was always interested in people and curious about their hopes and dreams. After about an hour, I asked if I could interview him about his life and dreams. He said yes and handed me his camera. I then got a pen and piece of paper and wrote down some questions that I thought would be interesting. As I was reading the questions to him in the midst of the interview I realized that the camera wasn&#39;t on. So, I turned it on. I have hundreds of hours of footage of us hanging out, vacationing, dancing, and sharing our thoughts on life. This video was a very personal conversation between two friends that I wanted to share so that people would see his humanity and beautiful heart. The interview was transcribed and published with Michael&#39;s permission in Interview magazine several years ago. Please feel free to look it up. He was happy to share it and loved how it was a conversation between two friends and not a journalist prying into his private life. It is not for sale and never will be. </span></p></body>
