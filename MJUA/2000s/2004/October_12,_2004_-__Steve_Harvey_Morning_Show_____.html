As previously reported, the clip features Slim Shady dressed as Jackson in scenes showing the star&#39;s nose falling off, being thrown up on, his hair catching fire and sitting at the foot of a bed while little kids jump behind him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The footage prompted Jackson to send a letter to all networks Monday requesting the video be pulled from rotation. So far, only BET has agreed to stop running the clip.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Early Tuesday, Jackson called Steve Harvey&#39;s morning radio show on KKBT Los Angeles to vent. Tuesday evening, the entertainer (and his rep, Raymone Bain) spoke to Lee Bailey about the video, as well as Jackson&#39;s new album &ndash; due Nov 16.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson: I wanted to call and say thank you for your support and your loyalty, your caring, everything you&#39;re doing pertaining to this situation. Thank you so, so much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Lee Bailey: Well we&#39;re just reporting what we&#39;re seeing, and we&#39;d gotten a whole bunch of letters from people who were speaking out against the video, so we just reported that. How are you holding up?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Oh, I&#39;m holding up pretty well, day by day. I&#39;m holding up pretty well.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: I always wonder how you deal with everything?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. You just pray and keep going. Persevere.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: Now are you able to work (on music) while you&#39;re going through all of this?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yes, I do.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(BAIN STEPS IN)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Raymone Bain: We have a new CD coming out. &ldquo;Michael Jackson the Ultimate Collection,&rdquo; due Nov 16, 9with0 57 tracks, 13 new songs, a 64-page booklet, and never-before-released concert footage. And he&#39;ll be out promoting that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: Really&hellip;..(laughs). You&#39;re not afraid, literally, of going out and promoting it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Noooo, are you kidding. No, no, never.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: And you have 13 new songs, you said?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Yes, these are some of the songs from previous albums. When I do an album, I usually write like 60 to 70 songs, sometimes more. These are some of the songs that didn&#39;t make the album, but they&#39;re very good ones. And there are a couple of brand new ones, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: Now getting back to this Eminem thing&hellip;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(BAIN STEPS IN)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RB: Have you heard the latest? Eminem released a statement, he and Interscope, saying they stand by the video and they&#39;re disappointed that BET pulled it. And MTV came out saying they were going to continue to air it on MTV, MTV 2 and MTV Europe.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: So Michael, how do you feel about that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Well, I think it&#39;s the wrong thing to do. It should be pulled, it shouldn&#39;t be played. It&#39;s incorrect. [TO BAIN] Did you tell him about VH1?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(BAIN STEPS IN)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RB: VH1 sent out a release this evening saying they were meeting on whether or not they&#39;re going to air it. So for them to release something like that must mean they&#39;re more than likely to pull it. I can&#39;t see them releasing a statement saying they&#39;re in the process of meeting on it. So there&#39;s a lot of activity out there, but he&#39;s getting enormous support from the African American community &ndash; Radio One, Steve Harvey, and a number of entertainers who have called to offer their support because they feel that it is demeaning and disrespectful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: Do you get the sense that Eminem&#39;s not doing this against you personally, but against your public persona?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: That&#39;s incorrect. I would never do that to anyone, no other fellow artist. It&#39;s no respect. It&#39;s demeaning. It&#39;s appalling, really. It&#39;s not entertainment.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: Well I totally agree, but would it make a difference in your mind if he said he wasn&#39;t doing this as a personal attack &ndash; because I don&#39;t think he even knows you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(BAIN STEPS IN)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">RB: Well it is personal, Lee. He might not know Michael Jackson, but when you look at the video, it is personal. He&#39;s taken every aspect of this man&#39;s life and he&#39;s put it in his video. It&#39;s one thing to have a spoof, but it&#39;s another for it to be demeaning and embarrassing. And that&#39;s what he&#39;s done.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: What I&#39;m getting at is you&#39;ve never done anything to him for him to even remotely want to treat you like that for some personal reason, right?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: I don&#39;t know him. I&#39;ve never met him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">LB: Well, Mr. Jackson, it just seems like everyday, they&#39;re coming up with more stuff, but I gotta give it to you, you&#39;re holding up. Keep on, keeping on.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">MJ: Thank you very, very much. I appreciate everything you&#39;re doing.</span></p></body>
