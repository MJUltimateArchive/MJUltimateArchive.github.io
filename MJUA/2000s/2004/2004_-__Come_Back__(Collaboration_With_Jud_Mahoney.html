Jud told The Sun: &quot;Mogwai (referring to the dog) did not feel very well, so I took him to the vet. At some point in the middle of the scene where he was holding Mogwai&#39;s tail while they were introducing the thermometer from behind, the phone rang and it was Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I ran out and talked to him briefly and he told me that he liked a song that I had written entitled &#39;Man Enough&#39;, and he said something like, &#39;I&#39;m thinking about hiring you for MJJ Records.&#39;&rdquo; Naturally, Jud took the unique opportunity to meet Jackson, who was going through a &quot;very difficult time&quot; after his second case of abuse.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What surprised Jud the most in his surreal four-day visit to Neverland was how normal the star was. &quot;There was nothing crazy going on. He seemed like a genuinely lovely guy who was just focused on making records. There were a lot of dramas going on his life and he looked kind of frail.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Any fear of the news of Jackson&#39;s lifestyle dissipated when he arrived at the singer&#39;s ranch. &quot;The new Xbox had just come out and Michael was very involved in his games, especially in Halo (a fighting game),&quot; revealed Jud.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I did not care, but I sat down to play with him and he obviously kicked my ass, then we ate pizza.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although the subject he wrote with Jackson never saw the light of day, he says that collaboration was the most special of his career.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He was impacted by the energy and passion that the singer had in the study sessions.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I was a producer and I was doing well then, so I knocked up this track called &lsquo;Come Back&rsquo; with him. We both came up with melodies. He&rsquo;s very hands-on musically. People get the impression that he just goes in and sings these songs but he&rsquo;s actually the main part of all these records. He was amazing. His natural energy and passion is far beyond anybody else I&rsquo;ve worked with. Most people will sing a melody idea low because you&rsquo;re in a room with just two people trying to come up with a song. When Michael did it, he turned from a softly spoken guy to literally singing at the top of his voice. &nbsp;It was like a dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Inspired by his collaboration with Jackson and his passing, Jud will eventually step out from behind the controls to launch his solo career.</span></p></body>
