We have watched, as we have been vilified and humiliated. &nbsp;I personally, have suffered through many hurtful lies and references to me as &lsquo;Wacko Jacko&rsquo; as well as the latest untruth about me fathering quadruplets.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">This is intolerable and must stop. &nbsp;The public depiction of us is not who we are, or what we are: we are a loving family. &nbsp;My success on stage can be attributed to the love and support of my family off stage. &nbsp;My brothers and I are &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; first, we started out together and will always be together. All I can hope for is that one day, my family will be shown the same kindness and respect that we have, throughout our lives, shown to others.</span></p></body>
