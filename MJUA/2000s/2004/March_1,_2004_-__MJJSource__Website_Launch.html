I am hoping that you will enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed creating it. Thank you to the creators of this site for your hard work and efforts in helping to make this website a reality. For revolutionary video quality, the site will feature a brand new CoDec technology.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I am very excited about using MJJSource.com as a way to communicate with both my fans around the world, and the media.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The theme of this web site is called, &quot;A New Beginning.&quot; I have become disturbed and troubled as a result of people speaking on my behalf whom I do not know. For months, I have listened to reports that are inaccurate because they have been based on hearsay, and not fact. I have also listened, with amazement, to people who have misrepresented their relationships with me. I will use this site as one of the mediums for speaking out on my own behalf. In the coming weeks, you will find exclusive news, interviews and never before seen photos, right here on MJJSource.com.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">To my wonderful fans, thank you so much for your letters, thoughts, love and prayers.
