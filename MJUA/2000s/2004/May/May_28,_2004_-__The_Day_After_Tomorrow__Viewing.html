Typically, the artist spent time with the Jackson brood on the West Coast. But over Memorial Day weekend in 2004, the star and his tykes surprised Nordahl by visiting Santa Fe via Jackson&#39;s plush private bus (with a 60-inch plasma TV). Jackson suggested a movie outing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I thought we were going to a screening room,&quot; Nordahl says. &quot;His driver pulled into DeVargas Mall. He was friends with (Roland Emmerich), the director of The Day After Tomorrow, and it was opening weekend. The mall was jammed, and there was no place to park. I took the kids, got the tickets and popcorn, and we went in. Michael came in after the lights went down.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;The lights came up, and nobody noticed him. He had on a baseball cap and these Chinese silk pajamas. The kids had no masks on. Any of those rags would have paid $100,000 for that picture.&quot;</span></p></body>
