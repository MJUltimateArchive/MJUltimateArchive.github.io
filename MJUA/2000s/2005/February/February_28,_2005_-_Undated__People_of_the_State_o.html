So, I started talking to Michael and became ultimately--I guess you would say--a confidant. He would call me, he would sometimes let our phone conversations be recorded, he gave me access that others didn&#39;t, and finally, ultimately invited me to his mother&#39;s home in the valley in Encino to do the television interview. You asked me how he was before the trial. He was--on the good side, he was very typical, normal-seeming, except for the packaging, I mean, obviously there&#39;s--Michael had a very unusual personal style and all the rest of it... but the way he was with his children was absolutely normal. I&#39;m the father of five, and, like me, Michael often refereed Nickelodeon or Disney Channel, Captain Crunch or Cheerios. I saw him without a nanny, without a PR person. It was just me and Michael and the three children. the youngest was just about a year old at the time. He would change the diapers, he would feed the children, he would be the person--the primary caregiver, and I could not fault him one bit. He was absolutely as competent as any single dad I have seen, and as normal. That&#39;s the good news. The bad news is, as the trial got closer and closer, he became more paranoid, more frightened. I mean, it is a frightening prospect, when every time you turn on the television--think about it, someone is saying, &quot;You&#39;re gonna go to jail for 20 or 30 years&quot;, and &quot;good riddance&quot;, and &quot;he&#39;s sick&quot;, and &quot;he&#39;s a pervert&quot;, and all the rest of it. I would often be with him and watch with my own eyes when he would retreat into a fetal position. He would crunch himself up in the corner of a couch. He would be in a room--this is not when the children were around obviously--he would be in a room where the blinds were drawn and no sunlight was coming in, and he would cover his ears, in the way children sometimes do when they don&#39;t want to hear a parent tell them they can do or can&#39;t do something, and I found the only way to--when he behaved like that--was to be a parent and to be stern with him, and tell him, &quot;You&#39;ve got to man up here.&quot; And, as you all know, he was acquitted, my mustache was saved.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Diane Dimond, anti-Jackson tabloid reporter, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/16/features.musicmonthly20"><span class="cs8567212B">The Guardian (March 16, 2008)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I was waiting for him to come to court one day and he was running late, so I stepped out to make a call,&rdquo; says Dimond. &ldquo;There Michael Jackson was with his mother, who was holding a picnic basket, and with his bodyguards, and he looked right at me and made this&hellip; gesture across his throat.&rdquo; She laughs uneasily. &ldquo;And I thought, &lsquo;Whatever happened to that wispy little voice?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Bob Sanger, attorney for Michael Jackson during the trial, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.laweekly.com/michael-jacksons-lawyer-bob-sanger-talks-to-west-coast-sound-about-the-pop-star-his-life-and-his-reading-habits/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo; (June 25, 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627013856/https://www.laweekly.com/michael-jacksons-lawyer-bob-sanger-talks-to-west-coast-sound-about-the-pop-star-his-life-and-his-reading-habits/"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Bob Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: When you represent [Michael Jackson], which I did, unfortunately &ndash; unfortunately for him that we had to do this, but you do get very close to a person, and I sat next to him for four months in the criminal case &ndash; it took a full four months, and he was there every day. But what I did learn in the years that I represented him &ndash; particularly in that last case &ndash; is that he is a very kind person. Truly from his heart. And his whole family is like that. His mother, Katherine, and his sisters, LaToya and Janet &ndash; they have their own personalities onstage and everything, but they are the kindest, sweetest people you&#39;ll ever want to meet. And his brothers are very nice; they offer to do what they can for you.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember having a family meeting out at the ranch, in a room out there that was nicely appointed, as everything was. And we were all going to sit down and have a big meeting. And Janet says, &#39;Bob, you don&#39;t have a place to sit.&#39; I told her it was okay, I could stand, and she said, &#39;No, no, no, I&#39;ll get you a chair.&#39; She walks out the door, and I figure she&#39;s going to get someone to bring me a chair. She walks in with this big wing-backed armchair that she&#39;s carrying into the room &ndash; Janet Jackson &ndash; for me to sit in. It wasn&#39;t remarkable in that it was any different that what you&#39;d expect from anyone in that family, or from her.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">They were very kind. You would go to the ranch, or a house elsewhere where we met on other occasions, and you couldn&#39;t get away without being offered something to eat or drink. And personally, and I don&#39;t mean snap your fingers and someone comes to do it, they would be very concerned and very kind and generous about everything. And Michael was the same way. He believed that one of the things he could do in life in addition to entertainment was that he could really help children. And I know that&#39;s going to immediately get some kind of sarcastic response, but it&#39;s absolutely true.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I was there at his ranch when he wasn&#39;t even there on at least two occasions when he had a giant group of kids come up. One, a bunch of kids who were from hospitals down in LA &mdash; children&#39;s wards &mdash; came up with their families and everything else, and another time it was disadvantaged kids with their families, they were brought up and came up on buses &ndash; he had a couple of buses &ndash; and he would bring people up and it was like they were at Disneyland. His staff was there, and at one point he had a hundred-something people on staff. They would be offering everybody candy, and something to drink, and play in the game room, and go to the movie theater. And you&#39;d see these kids, and it was just remarkable to see these kids and their eyes so wide and being treated this way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Did the attorney in you ever become concerned with that? Here are hundreds of strangers coming into this multimillionaire&#39;s home, and anyone of them could have ulterior motives.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Well, I don&#39;t want to get into all that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No, no, I understand.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Well, you know what? Yeah, the attorney in me, I look at what clients do and I always wonder. But, I&#39;ve got to tell you: until we saw what this last family tried to do to him, which was so completely bizarre and off-the-wall, unfounded, manipulative &mdash; the DA was so committed to get back at Michael Jackson that they just looked with blinders at these people, and ignored the fact that they had scammed other people, and so on. But when you saw that family and looked at that, you had to say, &#39;Oh my god, how vulnerable&#39; &ndash; clearly he was vulnerable. But for a family like this to be able to get the attention of a district attorney and law enforcement was just remarkable. And it just shows you how vulnerable people can be.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And I&#39;ve certainly seen that in my career in representing people for the last 35 years, certainly there are cases &ndash; people are prosecuted because they&#39;re guilty, sure, but people are also prosecuted because the government can, and sometimes there are some bad motives. And I don&#39;t want to talk about the particulars of that case, but it was just so clear how vulnerable he was.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The groups stopped at that point because we were in the trial &ndash; or at least I didn&#39;t see any, because I was busy trying to save his life, basically. But prior to that when I&#39;d see these people come in, the generosity, and the kindness &ndash; the staff was told at all times, whenever you go to Neverland, or to his house elsewhere, the staff was always instructed to be absolutely kind to everybody. The kindness ran from the top down. And it wasn&#39;t the obsequious kind of stuff. It was true kindness, and it came from the top. Michael was kind, the whole family was. And that&#39;s the stuff that people don&#39;t see. They don&#39;t understand how deep the concept of kindness ran in his family.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And the third thing was that Michael was extremely well-read.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: I didn&#39;t know that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No. Few people did. In trial &ndash; and I knew Michael, but I got to know him a lot better at the trial. The judge was doing jury selection, and it was time for break. Judge Melville said, &#39;Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know that jury service is very, very important.&#39; He&#39;s trying to convince people not to have stupid excuses to get out of jury service. All judges do this. He says, &#39;The jury system is a very time-honored system. It&#39;s been around for 200 years. We&#39;re going to take a break and come back in 15 minutes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We stand up and the judge leaves, and Michael turns to me and says, &ldquo;Bob, the jury system is much older than 200 years, isn&#39;t it?&#39; I said, &#39;Well, yeah, it goes back to the Greeks.&#39; He says, &#39;Oh yeah, Socrates had a jury trial, didn&#39;t he?&#39; I said, &#39;Yeah, well, you know how it turned out for him.&#39; Michael says, &#39;Yeah, he had to drink the hemlock.&#39; That&#39;s just one little tidbit. We talked about psychology, Freud and Jung, Hawthorne, sociology, black history and sociology dealing with race issues. But he was very well read in the classics of psychology and history and literature.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: That&#39;s fascinating.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: He loved to read. He had over 10,000 books at his house. And I know that because &ndash; and I hate to keep referring to the case, because I don&#39;t want the case &ndash; the case should not define him. But one of the things that we learned &ndash; the DA went through his entire library and found, for instance, a German art book from 1930-something. And it turned out that the guy who was the artist behind the book had been prosecuted by the Nazis. Nobody knew that, but then the cops get up there and say, &#39;We found this book with pictures of nude people in it.&#39; But it was art, with a lot of text. It was art. And they found some other things, a briefcase that didn&#39;t belong to him that had some </span><span class="cs43C038A">Playboys</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> in it or something. But they went through the guy&#39;s entire house, 10,000 books. And it caused us to do the same thing, and look at it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And there were places that he liked to sit, and you could see the books with his bookmarks in it, with notes and everything in it where he liked to sit and read. And I can tell you from talking to him that he had a very &ndash; especially for someone who was self-taught, as it were, and had his own reading list &ndash; he was very well-read. And I don&#39;t want to say that I&#39;m well-read, but I&#39;ve certainly read a lot, let&#39;s put it that way, and I enjoy philosophy and history and everything myself, and it was very nice to talk to him, because he was very intellectual, and he liked to talk about those things. But he didn&#39;t flaunt it, and it was very seldom that he would initiate the conversation like that, but if you got into a conversation like that with him, he was there.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: Do you remember the last time you saw him, or talked to him?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: The last time I talked to him was right after the trial, and then he moved out of the country. I had not seen him personally, in person &ndash; I talked to him on the phone &ndash; since them. Of course, I talked to people around him, because we still took care of matters for him. But the best I can say, and I don&#39;t want to oversell my significance in his world, but I want to convey this side of him that people didn&#39;t see. I just hate &ndash; every time I hear Jay Leno or somebody take a cheap shot &ndash; and Jay Leno I think is a very funny man &ndash; but every time they take a cheap shot I think, that really isn&#39;t fair, because that&#39;s not who he is. And few people had an opportunity to really experience the kindness of him and his family. And few people really had the opportunity the have these intellectual discussions about great thinkers and writers. Freud and Jung &ndash; go down the street and try and find five people who can talk about Freud and Jung.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&ldquo;LA Weekly&rdquo;</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: So I have to ask. Are you representing his estate?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Sanger</span><span class="csD5D7D290">: No, no. I represented him up here for Santa Barbara-type matters.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Frank Dileo, manager from 1984-1990, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13015497/hit-man"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Nashville Scene&rdquo; (November 22, 2007)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190826212831/https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13015497/hit-man"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Jackson went on trial in 2005, Frank stayed in Los Angeles for over three months, on his own dime. &ldquo;I know that he is innocent,&rdquo; Dileo says. &ldquo;A lot of people attack him for a lot of different reasons.

In fact, when I went there, he didn&rsquo;t know I was coming. It was very emotional. He went, &lsquo;Frank, I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re here.&rsquo; And he started to cry. And I went over and I hugged him and we got on the elevator and he told [defense attorney] Tom Mesereau, &lsquo;This is Frank Dileo. He used to manage me. I&rsquo;ve had nine managers since then.
