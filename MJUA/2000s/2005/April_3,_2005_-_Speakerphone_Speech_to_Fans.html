We will be victorious.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I love you!&quot; said Jackson, collecting an earful of screams from fans who shouted back: &quot;We love you!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson apologized for not being able to be at the hotel to personally thank his fans - who are expected to hold another rally for him Monday outside the courthouse - for their support.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;You understand I can&#39;t be there today,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;I wish I could...

Keep on dancing. I love you all very much.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When he got off the phone, fans cheered loudly and the program turned to music. The first song played was Jackson&#39;s &quot;D.S.&quot; which is known to be a bitter denunciation of his prosecutor.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Two young boys led the group in prayer to kick off the event, during which Jackson memorabilia was sold and a raffle was held for a white fedora hat signed by the entertainer. Chants of &quot;Michael! Innocent!&quot; went up periodically.</span></p></body>
