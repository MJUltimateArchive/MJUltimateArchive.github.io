Apparently, this information was leaked through transcripts in a grand jury proceeding where neither my lawyers, nor I, ever appeared. The information is disgusting and false. Years ago, I allowed a family to visit and spend some time at Neverland. Neverland is my home. I allowed this family into my home because they told me their son was ill with cancer and needed my help. Through the years, I have helped thousands of children who were ill or in distress. These events have caused a nightmare for my family, my children and me. I never intend to place myself in so vulnerable a position again. I love my community and I have great faith in our justice system. Please keep an open mind and let me have my day in court. I deserve a fair trial like every other American citizen. I will be acquitted and vindicated when the truth is told.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">CNN (January 31, 2005)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Pop singer Michael Jackson issued a video statement Sunday (January 30, 2005), a day before jury selection begins in his child molestation trial, calling leaks from the grand jury &quot;disgusting and false.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Please keep an open mind and let me have my day in court,&quot; he said in the message posted on his Web site. &quot;I will be acquitted and vindicated when the truth is told.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He added that the proceedings have been &quot;a nightmare for my family.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Release of the message was approved by Santa Barbara Superior Court Judge Rodney Melville.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, 46, was indicted by a grand jury on four counts of child molestation, four counts of administering an intoxicating agent, one count of attempted child molestation and one count of conspiracy to commit child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Earlier this month, ABC News reported details of secret grand jury testimony that included lurid allegations from Jackson&#39;s accuser about what the cancer-stricken boy said happened between him and Jackson behind closed doors at the singer&#39;s Neverland Ranch in early 2003.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s attorneys blasted the release of the material, noting that it had been ordered sealed by Melville. They also complained that because grand jury proceedings include the prosecution but not the defense, the accuser&#39;s statements were never subject to challenge during cross-examination.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In his statement, Jackson said the leaked information was &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;malicious,&quot; and that the grand jury testimony &quot;took place in a proceeding where neither my lawyers nor I ever appeared.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Years ago, I allowed a family to visit and spend some time at Neverland,&quot; Jackson said in the video message. &quot;Neverland is my home. I allowed this family into my home because they told me their son was ill with cancer and needed my help. Through the years, I have helped thousands of kids.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Last week, Melville denied a defense motion to question prospective jurors individually. Defense attorneys had argued that group questioning could contaminate the jury pool.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The accuser and his brother should testify in open court, Melville ruled, but he said he will prohibit sketch artists from drawing them during their testimony.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The prosecution wanted the boys to testify in a separate room without showing their faces in court. Jackson&#39;s attorneys disputed the prosecution&#39;s claim that the boys needed protection from the public eye, saying they had testified in other cases and had recently been spotted shopping in Beverly Hills with the district attorney.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In addition, Melville granted the prosecution&#39;s request to submit adult material seized from Michael Jackson&#39;s Neverland Ranch. However, the prosecution cannot refer to the material as &quot;pornography,&quot; &quot;obscene&quot; or &quot;erotic.&quot; Instead, the judge ruled that the district attorney must use the terms &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;sexually explicit.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He ruled against admitting any material seized outside Neverland Ranch or any materials from a case in 1993, when Jackson faced similar allegations. The self-proclaimed &quot;King of Pop&quot; resolved that case with a multimillion-dollar, out-of-court settlement, and no charges were filed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The prosecution plans to submit a sexually explicit magazine with the boys&#39; fingerprints, as well as Jackson&#39;s.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson attorney Brian Oxman said evidence will show his client took the magazine away from the boys, but prosecutor Ron Zonan said that will not explain why there are fingerprints on the inside of the magazine.</span></p></body>
