Jackson himself is not expected to attend.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">His spokesman, Shawn Andrews, told the newspaper Berliner Morgenpost: &quot;Michael is a fan of Germany and has fallen in love with the city of Berlin.&quot; One possibility is that Michael will build a Disneyland-style home, based on the German fairytale castle Neuschwanstein. Mr Andrews added: &quot;This is definitely not a PR gag. Michael is really planning this.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joe Jackson decided to throw the Berlin party as a demonstration of his thanks to Michael&#39;s loyal European fans during the trial. He told a press conference in Berlin: &quot;The sole reason for my trip to Europe is to thank the European people for their solidarity.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">One thousand guests have received a golden ticket to the three-day event. One invitee, Bianca Schmidt, held up a banner for eight days outside the court in Santa Maria that read: &quot;Germany fights with you. Keep the faith.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ms Schmidt, 35, said: &quot;It is amazing that we can now celebrate his freedom with members of his family.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"><a class="csDBD8AC8B" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808124236im_/http://0101.nccdn.net/1_5/376/2d8/04a/122480165913939.jpg"><span class="cs8567212B">Unknown magazine snippet</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">...According to German newspaper &quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot;, Jackson... is considering a move to Berlin. The singer&#39;s spokesman, Shawn Andrews, told the paper that he was planning to build a &quot;fairytale-style&quot; castle in the city.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Michael wants to live in Europe&quot;, Andrews is quoted as saying. &quot;He&#39;s a big fan of Germany and has fallen in love with the city of Berlin.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson was due to visit the city in July for his father Joe&#39;s 76th birthday party, which was thrown there as a thank you to German fans who stood by him during his child abuse trial. However, after the singer pulled out at the last minute--leaving a Jackson lookalike to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; instead--Jackson Sr. denied that his son had already made up his mind to relocate to Germany.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;There are no serious plans that I know of&quot;, he said. &quot;But it&#39;s one of several possibilities.&quot;</span></p></body>
