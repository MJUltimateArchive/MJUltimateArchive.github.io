Yes, Michael Jackson, now a twice-divorced father of three, will be 50</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">next year, more than a quarter century after the boyish impresario moonwalked onto the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">world stage. And even though he still has the trim body and the dancer moves of the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson of Thriller days, those glasses confirm the passage of time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In his first U.S. magazine interview and cover story in a decade, the King of Pop sat</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">down in a New York City hotel suite with Ebony magazine and offered a rare glimpse</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">into the life of an icon. The commander of a multimillion-dollar empire and arguably the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">single-most talented entertainer of a generation has not spoken publicly since his 2005</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">trial and acquittal. But today, he reflects on Thriller and struggles that put him on the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">world stage, and wonders aloud, where did the time go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On this unseasonably warm fall day, Jackson contemplated his past&mdash;this is his seventh</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">solo Ebony cover; he also had five Ebony covers with his brothers as a member of the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson 5, the first one in 1970. He talked about what went into the creation of Thriller&ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the first demos were done in his home studio in early 1982, with his sister Janet and</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">brother Randy singing background&ndash;&ndash;and questioned the state of the music industry today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Thriller dropped in the U.S. on November 30, 1982, America&ndash;&ndash;and the world&ndash;&ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">were in transition. Ronald Reagan was president, E.T. was stunning movie crowds and</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Justin Timberlake was almost 2 years old. The United Kingdom and Argentina were</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">sparring in the Falkland Islands, the Dow Industrial Average hit a record high of</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">1,065.49, and Olivia Newton-John&rsquo;s album Physical was No. 1 on the charts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael Joseph Jackson was quietly working in the studio with Quincy Jones, about</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">to make history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has been an international star since he was 6 years old. While most kids</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">were watching Scooby-Doo, Michael was choreographing the patented stage moves for</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">himself and his brothers, the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;In some ways, Michael was like a child. And in some ways, he was very sophisticated,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">remembers Walter Yetnikoff, then head of CBS Records. &ldquo;He was a very smart</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">businessman, would read contracts as good as lawyers could. But in some ways, back</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">then, he was like a baby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today that whispery, high-pitched voice has more bass in it. Those soft features have</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">become more defined. Traces of that &ldquo;baby&rdquo; in Michael Jackson appear to have faded.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, his musical genius and influence still dominate the music world, 25 years after</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thriller came out and went on to become the best-selling album of all time&ndash;&ndash;selling more</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">than 104 million copies worldwide, 54 million copies in the U.S., and spawning no less</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">than seven Top 10 hits and two No. 1 singles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But that complicated transition from youth to adulthood has left the star with many life</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">lessons, a few scars and even a bit of wisdom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On this day, as Michael&rsquo;s youngest child, Prince Michael Jackson II, 5&ndash;&ndash;whom he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">affectionately calls &ldquo;Blanket&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;sits nearby watching cartoons and oblivious to the fuss</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">everyone is making over his dad, Michael&rsquo;s life appears to have come full circle.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Jackson also has two other children, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, 9, and Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Joseph Jackson Jr. 10.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Jackson introduces his son, he instructs him about proper etiquette to greet his guests.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;No, stand up and use THAT hand,&rdquo; he shows the boy, who is reluctant to put down his</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">fistful of LifeSavers candy and shake hands.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In many ways, it is a very &ldquo;normal&rdquo; moment between a father and a son. And for Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson, after all his records and all the drama, that sense of normalcy&ndash;&ndash;and maturity&ndash;&ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">seems to punctuate this phase of his life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With nearly a dozen solo albums, and more than a dozen more No. 1 singles, 13</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Grammys and more than 750 million records sold worldwide in his career to date,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael is humble about and proud of his influence on music history and the current</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">music scene.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I always want to do music that influences and inspires each generation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">face it, who wants mortality?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;You want what you create to live, and I give my all in my work because I want it to</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">live.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to watch a music video without seeing a Michael</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson-influenced dance step, music or theme. Justin Timberlake and Usher imitate his</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">moves.

You know going in that this is the A-Team so you have to bring</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the &lsquo;A&rsquo; game.&rdquo; Michael had strong musical goals and a strong sense of what he wanted to</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">achieve artistically, he says, but the making of Thriller was also a very enjoyable</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">experience. &ldquo;Quincy always brought fun into the room. He understands how to cast&mdash;like</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">a casting director for a movie&mdash;he gets the right people for the right job, and Quincy does</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the same thing for music. It was a brilliant time. I just remember the fun of layering all</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the parts together, the bass and the strings and listening to Michael&rsquo;s vocals. We never</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">saw the big sales coming. It was really very special, and Michael&rsquo;s performances speak</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">for themselves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Ingram, a veteran singer and another protege of Jones, says, &ldquo;Quincy is ruthless</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">when it comes to music, he either thinks it&rsquo;s a hit or it&rsquo;s not, and he doesn&rsquo;t care who you</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">are,&rdquo; says James Ingram, who, with Quincy Jones, wrote &ldquo;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">a Top 10 hit from Thriller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Quincy&rsquo;s wife Peggy [Lipton] brought home some lingerie called &lsquo;Pretty Young Things&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">and Quincy, being the genius that he is, said that would be a good title,&rdquo; Ingram recalls.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael &ldquo;just killed the song&rdquo; in the studio recording, Ingram says, adding that he has</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">never seen a performer dance through a recording session like Michael Jackson.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Everybody I&rsquo;ve ever seen when they go into the studio, they put all of their energy into</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the microphone&ndash;&ndash;but here was Michael in there singing his butt off and dancing at the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">same time. That blew my mind,&rdquo; Ingram says now. &ldquo;See, Quincy is not from this planet&ndash;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ndash;he&rsquo;s a genius, and that&rsquo;s why he attracts all these geniuses [like Michael Jackson].&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also credits Jones for creating the magical moments that fueled Thriller, Off the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Wall and influenced the rest of his musical career. &ldquo;When I was 8 years old, Sammy</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Davis Jr. introduced me to Quincy Jones; I&rsquo;ll never forget it,&rdquo; Jackson says now. &ldquo;And I</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">overheard him say to Quincy, &lsquo;This guy is something; he&rsquo;s amazing. I tucked it away</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">subconsciously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Years later he asked Jones to work with him on his albums. Their chemistry on the set of</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the 1978 film The Wiz sparked a golden collaboration. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s great about working with</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Quincy is he lets you do your thing&hellip;&rdquo; Deliberate about the creative process, Jackson,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">who is a huge classical music fan, says, &ldquo;Once the right chemistry gets in the room,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">magic has to happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the production of The Wiz, Jones saw something in Jackson he had never seen</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">before. &ldquo;In the process, I got to see a side of him that was never exposed to the public</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">before,&rdquo; Jones tells Ebony. &ldquo;I saw how smart he was, how sensitive, and that had never</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">been represented on a record before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Jones almost didn&rsquo;t do the project. &ldquo;You know Epic [Records, part of CBS] didn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">want to use me&hellip; They said, &lsquo;No way, Quincy&rsquo;s too jazzy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Michael pushed for the maestro, and, as they say, the rest is history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nearly every day, Jones sees the impact of the project across the globe. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;ve been</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">around the world at least three times this year&ndash;&ndash;Angkor Wat, Vietnam, Seoul, Rwanda,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Cairo, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Moscow&ndash;&ndash;and, man, you cannot tell what city you are in</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">because at 12 o&rsquo;clock, they start kickin&rsquo; that music, and you will hear &lsquo;Wanna Be Startin&rsquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Something&rsquo; or &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &rsquo;Til You Get Enough&rsquo; or &lsquo;Billie Jean.&rsquo; It blows my mind, like</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">it was 25 years ago. I&rsquo;ve said it before: The &rsquo;80s were ours!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is a product of diverse creative forces, from Bach to Bo Diddley.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;Classical music, in truth, is really my real first love,&rdquo; Jackson reveals, and then adds</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;that, and real Southern &lsquo;gutbucket,&rsquo; as my uncle calls it; you feel it in your backbone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not surprisingly, Michael has a very intimate relationship with his music. For him, it&rsquo;s all</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">about the melody, and he does a rough &ldquo;template&rdquo; of all his songs. &ldquo;Getting the character</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">of the riff like you want it takes a lot of work and a lot of time.&rdquo; He talks about the music</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">as a protagonist, a story line. &ldquo;Music is tapestry, it&rsquo;s different layers, it&rsquo;s weaving in and</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">out, and if you look at it in layers, you understand it better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The King of Pop says working with Jones was so wonderful because &ldquo;he&rsquo;s genius enough</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">to stay out of the way of the music. If something needs to be added, he would add it&ndash;&ndash;like</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">a nice riff. He would say, &lsquo;Smelly [a nickname Jones gave to Jackson], let the song talk to</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">you. If a song needs strings, it will tell you. Get out of the way and leave room so that</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">God can walk in.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones agrees. &ldquo;That was my motto. You&rsquo;ve got to leave space for God to walk through</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">the room. It&rsquo;s not about us. The older I get, the more I see how little we all have to do</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">with anything, really.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&rsquo;s spirituality is another source of his creativity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I believe strongly in a higher force, and I&rsquo;m really thankful for all the blessings,&rdquo; he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">says. When he writes something that he knows is right, Jackson shares, he &ldquo;gets down on</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">his knees&rdquo; and gives thanks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On August 29 of next year, Michael Jackson will be 50. He admits that, while still in</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">excellent shape&ndash;&ndash;he doesn&rsquo;t have any special diet and rarely works out&ndash;&ndash;and more</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">creative than ever, he is a different man than he was at 24. &ldquo;I always had this tug in the</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">back of my head, the things I wanted to do, to raise children, have children.

He also takes them shopping and visits museums around the world.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today&rsquo;s Michael is maturing. And those who know him best can see it. The Rev. Jesse</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson has known Michael for most of his life; since the early Jackson 5 days. In 2005,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">he was in daily contact with Michael during the California trial, and today he serves as a</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">private adviser to the superstar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&ldquo;I think Michael is comfortable with himself,&rdquo; Rev. Jackson says. &ldquo;He knows he has a</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">special genius and talent, and he knows he has a special responsibility. And he knows he</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">is a superstar. He seems to have a great sense of self-control, but like any great star he&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">like an enigma to many people. But underneath all of that he is devoted to his mother and</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">father and brothers and sisters. In all that, he&rsquo;s a Jackson.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Thirty years from now, will Michael Jackson still be moon-walking at 80? No, he says,</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">sternly. He doesn&rsquo;t want to grow old doing concert after concert, flying from one megastadium</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">to the next. He just doesn&rsquo;t want to go out like that. &ldquo;Not the way James Brown</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">did or Jackie Wilson did,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They just kept going, running, killing themselves.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In my opinion, I wish [Brown] could have slowed down and relaxed and enjoyed his hard</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has other plans for his next 25 years. &ldquo;More in film, not on stage. I see myself</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">more productive in film, and directing, and directing myself in film. Not so much [on</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">stage] all over the world. Because [on stage] you&rsquo;re not capturing anything&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">fleeting. A concert is the most fleeting thing in the world. It&rsquo;s excellent to look at, but</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">you can&rsquo;t capture it. With film you stop time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For Michael Jackson, time has never stopped. With each year, each challenge, each child</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">and each success, he grows a little bit wiser.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has met the man in his mirror. And he likes him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290"> </span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Michael Jackson: In His Own Words</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Interview)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs51651BA7"><span class="csD5D7D290">Sitting on the sofa next to Michael Jackson, you quickly look past the enigmatic icon&#39;s light, almost translucent skin and realize that this African-American legend is more than just skin deep. More than an entertainer, more than a singer or dancer, the grown-up father of three reveals a confident, controlled and mature man who has a lot of creativity left inside him.</span></p><p class="cs51651BA7"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Joseph Jackson rocked the world in December 1982, when he exploded on the pop music scene with Thriller, the rich, rhythmic, infectious album that introduced many Whites to a talent that most Blacks had known for decades, and shattered nearly every industry record on the planet. The historic project was yet another, albeit giant, step in a musical career that began 18 years earlier, at age 6, with his brothers in the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="cs51651BA7"><span class="csD5D7D290">In his first major U.S. magazine interview in a decade and on the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson sat down with EBONY magazine for a rare, intimate and exclusive conversation about the creation of Thriller, the historic Motown 25 performance, being a father, the state of the music industry and the force behind his creativity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here is Michael Jackson, in his own words... </span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Thriller: How did it all start?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Motown was preparing to do this movie called The Wiz and Quincy Jones happened to be the man who was doing the music. Now, I had heard of Quincy before. When I was in Indiana as a child, my father used to buy jazz albums, so I knew him as a jazz musician.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So after we had made this movie &ndash; we had gotten pretty close on the film, too; he helped me understand certain words, he was really fatherlike &ndash; I called him after the movie, out of complete sincerity &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m a shy person, ESPECIALLY then. I used to not even look at people when they were talking to me, I&rsquo;m not joking, and I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to do an album. Could you recommend anybody who would be interested in producing it with me or working with me?&rdquo; He paused and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let ME do it?&rdquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rsquo; Probably because I was thinking that he was more my father, kind of jazzy. So after he said that, I said, &ldquo;WOW, that would be great.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s great about working with Quincy is he lets you do your thing. He doesn&rsquo;t get in the way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first thing I came to him with was from Off the Wall, our first album, and Rod Temperton came in the studio, and he came with this killer &ndash; he&rsquo;s this little German guy from Worms, Germany &ndash; he comes with this &ldquo;doop, dakka dakka doop, dakka dakka dakka doop,&rdquo; this whole melody and chorus, &ldquo;rock with you.&rdquo; When I heard that, I said, &ldquo;OK, I really have to work now.&rdquo; So every time Rod would present something, I would present something, and we&rsquo;d form a little friendly competition. I love working like that. I used to read how Walt Disney used to, if they were working on Bambi or an animated show, put a deer in the middle of the floor and make the animators kind of compete with different styles of drawing. Whoever had the most stylized effect that Walt liked, he would pick that. They would kind of compete, it was like a friendly thing, but it was competition, &lsquo;cause it breeds higher effort. So whenever Rod would bring something, I would bring something, then he would bring something, then I would bring something else. We created this wonderful thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So, after Off the Wall, in the spring of &rsquo;82, you went back in the studio to work on Thriller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> After Off the Wall, we had all these No. 1 hits from it &ndash; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock With You,&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Out of My Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Workin&rsquo; Day and Night&rdquo; &ndash; and we were nominated for a Grammy award, but I was just not happy with how the whole thing happened because I wanted to do much more, present much more, put more of my soul and heart in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was it a transition point for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> A COMPLETE transition. Ever since I was a little boy, I would study composition. And it was Tchaikovsky that influenced me most. If you take an album like Nutcracker Suite, every song is a killer, every one. People used to do an album where you&rsquo;d one good song and the rest were like B-sides. They&#39;d call them &ldquo;album songs,&rdquo; and I would say to myself, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t every one be like a hit song? Why can&rsquo;t every song be so great that people would want to buy it if you could release it as a single?&rsquo; So I always tried to strive for that. That was my purpose for the next album. That was the whole idea. I wanted to just put any one out that we wanted. I worked hard for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The creative process, were you deliberate about that, or did it just kind of happen?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I was pretty deliberate. Even though it all came together some kind of way, consciously, it was created in this universe, but once the right chemistry gets in the room, magic has to happen. It has to. It&rsquo;s like putting certain elements in one hemisphere and it produces this magic in the other. It&rsquo;s science. And getting in there with some of the great people, it&rsquo;s just wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But yeah, working with Quincy was such a wonderful thing. He lets you experiment, do the thing. He&rsquo;s genius enough to stay out of the way of the music, and if there&rsquo;s an element to be added, he&rsquo;ll add it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We would work on a track and then we&rsquo;d meet at his house, play what we worked on, and he would say, &ldquo;If the song needs something, it&rsquo;ll tell you. Let it talk to you.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve learned to do that. The key to being a wonderful writer is not to write. You just get out of the way. Leave room for God to walk in the room. And when I write something that I know is right, I get on my knees and say thank you. Thank you, Jehovah!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When&rsquo;s the last time you had that feeling?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, recently. I&rsquo;m always writing. When you know it&rsquo;s right, sometimes you feel like something&rsquo;s coming, a gestation, almost like a pregnancy or something. You get emotional, and you start to feel something gestating and, magic, there it is! It&rsquo;s an explosion or something that&rsquo;s so beautiful, you go, WOW! There it is. That&rsquo;s how it works through you. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. It&rsquo;s a universe of where you can go with those 12 notes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[He&rsquo;s now listening to an early version of &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; playing on an iPhone.]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What I do when I write is that I&rsquo;ll do a raggedy, rough version just to hear the chorus, just to see how much I like the chorus. If it works for me that way when it&rsquo;s raggedy, then I know it&rsquo;ll work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Listen to that, that&rsquo;s at home. Randy, Janet and I are going, &ldquo;whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.&rdquo; I do that, the same process, with every song. The melody is most important. If the melody can sell me, if I like the rough, then I&rsquo;ll go to the next step. If it sounds good in my head, it&rsquo;s usually good when I do it. The idea is to transcribe from what&rsquo;s in your mentality onto tape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Another big moment was the Motown 25 performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was at the studio editing &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; and for some reason I happened to be at Motown Studios doing it &ndash; I had long left the company. So they were getting ready to do something with the Motown anniversary, and Berry Gordy came by and asked me did I want to do the show I told him NO. I said no because the Thriller thing, I was building and creating something I was planning to do, and he said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the anniversary.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will do it, but the only way I&rsquo;ll do it is if you let me do one song that&rsquo;s not a Motown song.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Billie Jean.&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;OK, fine.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll really let me do &lsquo;Billie Jean?&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I rehearsed and choreographed and dressed my brothers, and picked the songs and the medley. And not only that, you have to work out all the camera angles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I direct and edit everything I do. Every shot you see is my shot. Let me tell you why I have to do it that way. I have five, no, six cameras. When you&rsquo;re performing &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t care what kind of performance you are giving &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t capture it properly, the people will never see it. It&rsquo;s the most selfish medium in the world. You&rsquo;re filming WHAT you want people to see, WHEN you want them to see it, HOW you want them to see it and what JUXTAPOSITION you want them to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How long have you been creating all of those elements?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Since I was a little boy, with my brothers. My father used to say, &ldquo;Show &lsquo;em, Michael, show &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did they ever get jealous of that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They never showed it at the time, but it must have been hard, because I would never get spanked during rehearsals or practice [laughter]. But afterwards was when I got in trouble [laughter]. It&#39;s true, that&#39;s when I would get it. My father would rehearse with a belt in his hand. You couldn&#39;t mess up. My father was a genius when it came to the way he taught us staging, how to work an audience, anticipating what to do next, or never [to] let the audience know if you are suffering or if something&#39;s going wrong. He was amazing like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is that where you think you got not just a lot of your business sense but how to control the whole package?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Absolutely. My father, experience; but I learned a lot from my father. He had a group when he was a young person called the Falcons. They came over and they played music all the time, so we always had music and dancing. It&#39;s that cultural thing that Black people do. You clear out all the furniture, turn up the music. When company comes, everybody gets out in the middle of the floor [and] you gotta do something. I loved that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do your kids do that now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They do, but they get shy: But they do it for me, sometimes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Speaking of showmanship: MTV didn&#39;t play Black folks. How hard was that for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They said they don&#39;t play [Black artists]. It broke my heart, but at the same time it lit something. I was saying to myself, &#39;I have to do something... I just refuse to be ignored.&#39; So yeah, &#39;&quot;Billie Jean,&#39;&quot; they said, &quot;We won&#39;t play it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But when they played it, it set the all-time record. Then they were asking me for EVERYTHING we had. They were knocking our door down. Then Prince came; it opened the door for Prince and all the other Black artists. It was 24-hour heavy metal, just a pot&not;pourri of crazy images. They came to me so many times in the past and said, &quot;Michael, if it wasn&#39;t for you. there would be no MTV.&quot; They told me that over and over, personally. I guess they didn&#39;t hear it at the time, but I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t mean any pure malice [laughter].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That really gave birth to the modern video age.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I used to look at MTV. My brother [Jackie], I&#39;ll never forget, he&#39;d say, &quot;Michael, you gotta see this channel. Oh my God, it&#39;s the best idea. They show music 24 hours a day!&quot; So I said, &quot;Let me see this.&quot; And I&#39;m watching it, I&#39;m seeing all this stuff going on and saying, &quot;If only they could give this stuff some more entertainment value, more story, a little more dance, I&#39;m sure people would love it more.&quot; I said, &quot;When I do something, it&#39;s gotta have a story &ndash; an opening, a middle and a closing&mdash;so you can follow a linear thread; there&#39;s got to be a thread through it. So while you are watching the entertainment value of it, you&#39;re wondering what is going to happen.&quot; That&#39;s when I started to experiment with &quot;Thriller,&quot; &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel,&quot; &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and directing and writing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you think about the state of music videos and music today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [The industry], it&#39;s at a crossroads. There&#39;s a transformation going on. People are confused, what&#39;s going to happen, how to distribute and sell music. I think the Internet kind of threw everybody for a real loop, &#39;cause it&#39;s so powerful, kids love it so much. The whole world is at their fingertips, on their lap. Anything they want to know, anyone they want to communicate with, any music, any movies. This thing, it just took everybody for a loop. Right now, all these Starbucks deals and Wal-Mart deals, direct to artist, I don&rsquo;t know if that&#39;s the answer. I think the answer is just phenomenal, great music. Just reaching the masses. I think people are still searching. There&#39;s not a real musical revolution going on right now either. But when it&#39;s there, people will break a wall down to get to it. I mean, before Thriller, it was the same kind of thing. People were NOT buying music. It helped to bring everybody back into the stores. So, when it happens, it happens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How does it feel to know you have changed history? Do you think about that a lot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Yeah, I do, I really do. I&#39;m very proud that we opened doors, that we helped tear down a lot. Going around the world, doing tours, in stadiums, you see the influence of the music. When you just look out over the stage, as far as the naked eye [can] see, you see people. And it&#39;s a wonderful feeling, but it came with a lot of pain, a lot of pain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How so?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When you&#39;re on top of your game, when you&#39;re a pioneer, people come at you. But I feel grateful, all those record-breaking things, to the biggest albums, to those No. 1s, I still feel grateful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m a guy who used to sit in my living room and listen to my father play Ray Charles. My mother used to wake me up at 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, &quot;Michael, he&#39;s on TV, he&#39;s on TV!&quot; I&#39;d run to the TV and James Brown would be on TV. I said, &quot;That&#39;s what I want to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> You&#39;re almost 50 now. Do you think you&#39;ll be doing this at 80?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The truth is, umm, no. Not the way James Brown did, or Jackie Wilson did, where they just ran it out, they killed themselves. In my opinion, I wish [Brown] could have slowed down and been more relaxed and enjoyed his hard work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Will you tour again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&#39;t care about long tours. But what I love about touring is that it sharpens one&#39;s craft beautifully. That&#39;s what I love about Broadway, that&#39;s why actors turn to Broadway, to sharpen their skills. It does do that. &#39;Cause it takes years to become a great entertainer. Years. You can&#39;t just grab some guy out of obscurity and throw &#39;em out there and expect for this person to compete with that person. It&#39;ll never work. And the audience knows it; they can see it. They can see it right away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now, Stevie Wonder, he&#39;s a musical prophet: He&#39;s another guy I have to credit. I used to say to myself, &#39;I want to write more.&#39; I used to watch [producers] Gamble and Huff, and Hal Davis and the Corporation write all those hits for the Jackson 5, and I really wanted to study the anatomy. What they used to do, they used to have us come in and sing after they did the track. I used to get upset &#39;cause I would want to see them make the track. So they would give me &quot;ABC&quot; after the track was done, or &quot;I Want You Back&quot; or &quot;The Love You Save.&quot; I wanted to experience it all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Stevie Wonder used to literally let me sit like a fly on the wall. I got to see Songs in the Key of Life get made, some of the most golden things. I would sit with Marvin Gaye. And these would be the people who would just come over to our house and hang out and play basketball with my brothers on the weekend. We always had these people around. So when you really can see the science, the anatomy and the structure of how it all works, it&#39;s just so wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you think about the presidential race? Hillary, Barack?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> To tell you the truth, I don&#39;t follow that stuff. We were raised to not look to man to fix the problems of the world. They can&#39;t do it. That&#39;s how I see it. It&#39;s beyond us. Look, we don&#39;t have control over the grounds, they can shake. We don&#39;t have control over the seas, they can have tsunamis. We don&#39;t have control over the skies, there are storms. We&#39;re all in God&#39;s hands. I think that man has to take that into consideration. I just wish they would do more for the babies and children, help them more. That would be great, wouldn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Speaking of babies, as a father now, rewind [to] 25 years ago. What is the difference between that Michael and the Michael today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That Michael is probably the same Michael here. I just wanted to get certain things accomplished first. But I always had this tug in the back of my head, the things I wanted to do, to raise children, have children. I&#39;m enjoying it very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you think about all the stuff that&#39;s out there about you, all the things you read? How do you feel about that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I don&#39;t pay attention to that. In my opinion, it&#39;s ignorance. It&#39;s usually not based on fact. It&#39;s based on, you know, myth. The guy who you don&#39;t get to see. Every neighborhood has the guy who you don&#39;t see, so you gossip about him. You see those stories about him, there&#39;s the myth that he did this or he did that. People are crazy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m just about wanting to do wonderful music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But back to Motown 25. One of the things that touched me the most about doing that was, after I did the performance&mdash;I&#39;ll never forget. There was Marvin Gaye in the wings, and the Temptations and Smokey Robinson and my brothers, they were hugging me and kissing me and holding me. Richard Pryor walked over to me and said [in a quiet voice], &quot;Now that was the greatest performance I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot; That was my reward. These were people who, when I was a little boy in Indiana, I used to listen to. Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, and to have them bestow that kind of appreciation on me, I was just honored. Then the next day, Fred Astaire called and said, &quot;I watched it last night, and I taped it, and I watched it again this morning. You&#39;re a helluva mover. You put the audience on their ASS last night!&quot; So later, when I saw Fred Astaire, he did this with his fingers [he makes a little Moonwalk gesture with his two fingers on his outstretched palm].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember doing the performance so clearly, and I remember that I was so upset with myself, &#39;cause it wasn&#39;t what I wanted. I wanted it to be more. But not until I finished. [There] was a little child, a little Jewish child backstage with a little tuxedo on. He looked at me and he said [in a stunned voice] &quot;Who taught you to move like that?&quot; [Laughter] And I said, &quot;I guess God &ndash; and rehearsal.&quot;</span></p></body>
