Early response in America and around the world has been tremendous, with copies of the magazine flying off shelves and requests for additional copies coming in from as far as Italy, Finland, Australia and Japan.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs43C038A">As a bonus for readers online, the editors of Ebony have agreed to answer a few of your questions and offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the making of the cover. Here are their thoughts:</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span class="cs43C038A"><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image0.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Ebony magazine had been working with Michael and his staff for the past eight months on the details of the shoot and interview. Originally, we had tried to get together in early August, but schedules collided. The final date, Monday, September 24, 2007, was set and the teams were mobilized.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The night before, Sunday, Michael and his son Prince Michael, II, fondly known as &quot;Blanket,&quot; arrived at the hotel suite-turned dressing room to look at the clothes selected by renowned stylist Phillip Bloch. Italian designer Roberto Cavalli provided clothing, as well as such designers as Valentino, Yohji Yamamoto, Hugo Boss, Cesare Paciotti, and more. Plus we had more than $2 million worth of diamond jewelry on set from the likes of Jacob the Jeweler, H. Stern and Lorraine Schwartz.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next morning, we arrived around 9 a.m. at the Brooklyn Museum. Normally, the museum is closed to the public on Mondays, but the staff allowed us to use the location for the historic shoot. Celebrity photographer Matthew Rolston, Ebony creative director Harriette Cole and Ebony photo director Dudley Brooks had already scouted several locations including the grand Beaux-Arts Court, Egyptian gallery and sculpture garden. Then, around 3 p.m., the shoot began.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the session, a relaxed Michael grooved to his own music - PYT, Billie Jean, Human Nature - booming from a sound system and even showed off a few of his trademark dance moves. After five wardrobe changes and six hours of memorable photography, he thanked the crew and was on his way back to the hotel, just in time to put the kids to bed.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The next day, we arrived at his hotel around noon for what would be Michael Jackson&#39;s first sit down interview in years. For the next hour and a half, Jackson shared his thoughts and passions on the making of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Thriller </span><span class="csD5D7D290">, MTV and music videos, God, fatherhood and the state of the music industry today. You will find that interview and more in the pages of the December issue of Ebony magazine.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Meanwhile, more than 200 readers from around the world have already written in over the past few days with questions about the shoot, the interview and the star. Here are a few of those questions, along with comments from the Ebony team -- vice president and editorial director Bryan Monroe, creative director Cole and senior editor Joy Bennett -- who were with him over those three days...</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image1.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q: How did you get the interview with Michael? Was it easy?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Marni in Australia</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Bryan Monroe) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">| Because of the nearly 40-year relationship between Johnson Publishing Company -- the owner of Ebony and Jet magazines in Chicago -- and the Jackson family, a relationship that began when Michael was part of the Jackson Five, we knew that, when and if Michael was ready to re-emerge back onto the world stage, who better to do it with than Ebony. We had been talking with his team in Washington, D.C. for the past eight months and Michael himself requested that it be Ebony and Jet magazines to have his first U.S. cover and interview in years.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image2.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: &nbsp;&nbsp;Will Michael Jackson do another world tour?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Dusty in Dublin, Ireland</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Bryan Monroe) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">| Michael didn&#39;t say specifically when or if he would tour, but was hesitant about taking on another global concert series. &quot; I don&#39;t care about long tours,&quot; he told us in the interview. He doesn&#39;t want to grow old doing concert after concert, flying from one mega-stadium to the next. &quot;Not the way James Brown did and or Jackie Wilson did,&quot; he said in the article. &quot;They just kept going, running, killing themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, I wish [Brown] could have slowed down and relaxed and enjoyed his hard work.&quot;</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image3.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: &nbsp;&nbsp;What was one of the more memorable moments during the interview?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Carl in Florida</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Bryan Monroe) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">| It was very interesting to watch him react when we played a digital video of the famous </span><span class="cs43C038A">Motown 25 </span><span class="csD5D7D290">performance for him on my MacBook Pro, and later when he listened to and talked about an early demo version of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Billie Jean </span><span class="csD5D7D290">on my iPhone. He was both excited to be back in the moment and equally uncomfortable talking about his performances.

He showed of a few of his classic moves during the photo shoot - the leg twist/kick move in particular. Yes, he&#39;s still got it.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image5.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: &nbsp;&nbsp;When is a new CD coming out?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- K.

Michael told us repeatedly that he was writing every day and recording in the studio. &nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that he thinks he&#39;s got more blockbuster hits coming out (see the story for more on his writing process). &nbsp;&nbsp;Neither he nor his staff will confirm a date but we&#39;ll be on the lookout for an early 2008 new release.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image6.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: &nbsp;&nbsp;Is he very shy in person?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Stacie in New York</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A. </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Joy Bennett) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">| No, surprisingly he was not very shy.

But make no mistake, despite his unusually light skin, he has said it is due to a skin condition called vitiligo, Michael is still 100 percent African American.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image8.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: I think America still has yet to grasp the influence and position Michael has internationally. You can ask a woman who grew up in a small community in Norway, and a woman who grew up in Africa, and they will know his name, and his music. I have some questions: Who decided on the clothing? Was it picked by the stylist, and approved by Michael Jackson beforehand? Why this particular museum? Was the location picked by Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Annette in Norway</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Harriette Cole) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">| Michael wanted to be photographed in an artistic setting and the Brooklyn Museum gladly accommodated us all. &nbsp;&nbsp;We shot in the midst of ancient and contemporary history, and it was powerful to be in that space. Regarding the wardrobe, we worked with celebrity fashion stylist Phillip Bloch to develop concepts for wardrobe and then he and his team went shopping. &nbsp;&nbsp;We really wanted him to look elegant and timeless on the cover. We found a number of looks that would achieve that and presented them to Michael. He ultimately chose what he would be happy to wear--which turned out to be far more outfits than we had time to shoot! &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Jackson was the perfect fit for everything we put on him. It was a lot of fun to work with someone who looks great in clothes, who knows how to move his body and who understands the camera. It was magic!</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image9.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Could you give us some insights on what went into the thought process of Michael&#39;s choice of fashion accessories that complemented each outfit?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Michelle</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Harriette Cole) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">We learned before the shoot that Michael loves jewelry, especially diamonds, more particularly diamond brooches. So Phillip and his team went diamond shopping, calling upon some of the most well known jewelers in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;And sure enough we ended up with more than $2 million worth of jewelry at the shoot for Michael&#39;s consideration.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image10.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">Q: Did most of the people who worked with Michael, during the interview or photo shoot feel intimidated by him? &nbsp;How did he interact with the crew? </span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Samantha and Michele</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Harriette Cole) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">What I loved the most about working with Michael Jackson is how kind he was to everyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;He was gracious to the elevator operator, the guard and the executives in the museum. He made sure to thank each person who was in earshot when the shoot was over. He was generous and kind. &nbsp;&nbsp;Did some people feel intimidated by him? I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right word. More, I think some people were mesmerized. Some were pinching themselves wondering if they actually were in the presence of the King of Pop.</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image11.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Michael looks healthier and happier than he&#39;s been in years (not just in the photo shoot but in paparazzi pictures even). &nbsp;&nbsp;In your time spent with Michael, did you get a sense that he really wants to make a comeback and reinvent the music industry again? &nbsp;&nbsp;The world is awaiting his next move, but I get the feeling he doesn&#39;t even realize how much he is missed in the music scene.</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Robert</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A: </span><span class="cs43C038A">(Harriette Cole) </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael certainly seemed healthy and happy--and more, content. &nbsp;&nbsp;He had a peace about him that was palpable. &nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed comfortable in his own skin. Never mind, he&#39;s got the body that any woman or man would die for! At 49 years old, he&#39;s got a slim dancer&#39;s body, evidence of consistent, disciplined exercise. So, could he make a comeback? He certainly seems strong enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that he is actively in the studio creating. &nbsp;&nbsp;He told us that he travels with a tape recorder so that whenever he gets the inspiration to make music he can capture it for later reflection. &nbsp;&nbsp;He also noted that many artists today are not reaching inside to create their own unique music. He thinks it&#39;s breakthrough time. That certainly could include a Michael Jackson breakthrough--or should I say another one!</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image12.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Tell us about BLANKET! That little mysterious baby! How did you find the little boy? Was he a well-behaved kid? &nbsp;How are both father and son to each other?

His daughter, Paris, is 9 and he has another son, Michael Joseph, 10. Blanket was incredibly well-behaved while he was in our company, which is saying a lot for a 5-year-old. &nbsp;&nbsp;He is obviously very close to his dad. They walked into the fitting holding hands and only separated when both of them became at ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael&#39;s parenting skills were to be commended. &nbsp;&nbsp;Without many words, with very subtle gestures he offered discipline, guidance and support. &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael also obviously wants Blanket to learn good manners, so when the Ebony team came into the room for the interview, Michael coached Blanket on the proper way to shake hands and say hello. &nbsp;&nbsp;Small things, but isn&#39;t it the small things that show the measure of one&#39;s true self?</span></p><p class="cs202B20AC"><span><img src="September%2024,%202007%20-%20_Ebony_%20Magazine%20Photoshoot_files/image13.jpg" width="624" height="4" alt="" style="border-width:0px;" /></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Q: Are there plans for another Ebony/Jet/Michael Jackson collaboration in the near future?</span></p><p class="csA300C48E"><span class="cs43C038A">-- Jamison</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">A.

And the movie helped to show behind the scenes, which we didn&rsquo;t see before. I got to see&ndash;I was with him&ndash;we did the last photo shoot with him and I spent time with him. And what I recall about Michael was that he just exuded love, which is not what people were saying about him. Interestingly, he was such a visionary, too. We know it about his&ndash;you know, the dance genius and pushing the music forward, but also his love of the environment. And look at what we&rsquo;re dealing with now, you know, with the oil spill. He made music talking about honor the environment, honor each other, and now we are recognizing he was a visionary in that part, too.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Matthew Rolston, photographer, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://stocklandmartelblog.com/2009/07/09/behind-the-scenes-at-michael-jacksons-2007-ebony-photo-shoot/"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Dateline NBC&rdquo; (July 2009)</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84"> (<a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324173823/http://stocklandmartelblog.com/2009/07/09/behind-the-scenes-at-michael-jacksons-2007-ebony-photo-shoot"><span class="cs8567212B">archived</span></a></span><span class="cs76EFAA84">)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael would perform a photograph as much as a song or a dance and with great joy, great style.
