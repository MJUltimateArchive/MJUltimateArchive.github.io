I didn&#39;t realize how it came about. I thought maybe because I&#39;d worked with Macaulay, but no. Actually, Bruce Weber, whom I&#39;d never worked with before, thought of me for that project. It was for </span><span class="cs43C038A">L&#39;Uomo Vogue</span><span class="csD5D7D290">, and it was the first shoot Michael had done in 10 years. They asked me to come back and do the cover of </span><span class="cs43C038A">Ebony</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> with him too. Those were his last photo shoots. He was really lovely. I can relive it all in my mind because I was so full of adrenaline when it was going on. I had to talk to him on the phone before I met him. I was at a cash machine and the phone rang and it was his people clearing the line to make sure it was me. He was gonna call me in seven minutes, so I ran home, not wanting to be on the street with sirens and street noise. I got so nervous, I had to breathe into a ziploc bag. I was hyperventilating. But he sounded so scared himself that I instantly calmed down. I sort of felt for him. And when I met him in person, he had dark glasses on so you couldn&#39;t see his eyes. He seemed very shy, but when we started to work together, I guess he got my energy, and he was so sweet, quite considerate of me and my working process.</span></p></body>
