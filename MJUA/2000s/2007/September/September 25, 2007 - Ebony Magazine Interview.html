Yes, Michael Jackson, now a twice-divorced father of three, will be 50 next year, more than a quarter century after the boyish impresario moonwalked onto the world stage. And even though he still has the trim body and the dancer moves of the Michael Jackson of Thriller days, those glasses confirm the passage of time.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In his first U.S. magazine interview and cover story in a decade, the King of Pop sat down in a New York City hotel suite with EBONY magazine and offered a rare look into the life of an icon. The commander of a multimillion-dollar empire and arguably the single-most talented entertainer of a generation has not spoken publicly since his 2005 trial and acquittal. But today, he reflects on Thriller and the struggles that put him on the world stage, and wonders aloud, where did the time go?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On this unseasonably warm fall day, Jackson contemplated his past--this is his seventh solo EBONY cover; he also had five EBONY covers with his brothers as a member of the Jackson 5, the first one in 1970. He talked about what went into the creation of Thriller--the first demos were done in his home studio in early 1982 with his sister Janet and brother Randy singing background--and questioned the state of the music industry today.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When Thriller dropped in the U.S. on Nov. 30, 1982, America--and the world--were in transition. Ronald Reagan was president, E.T. was stunning movie crowds and Justin Timberlake was almost 2 years old. The United Kingdom and Argentina were sparring in the Falkland Islands, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high of 1,065.49, and Olivia Newton-John&#39;s album Physical was No. 1 on the charts.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael Joseph Jackson was quietly working in the studio with Quincy Jones, about to make history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has been an international star since he was 6 years old. While most kids were watching Scooby-Doo, Michael was choreographing the patented stage moves for himself and his brothers, the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;In some ways, Michael was like a child. And in some ways, he was very sophisticated,&quot; remembers Walter Yetnikoff, then head of CBS Records. &quot;He was a very smart businessman, would read contracts as good as lawyers could. But in some ways, back then, he was like a baby.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today that whispery, high-pitched voice has more bass in it. Those soft features have become more defined. Traces of that &quot;baby&quot; in Michael Jackson appear to have faded. His musical genius and influence still dominate the music world, 25 years after Thriller came out and went on to become the best-selling album of all time--selling more than 104 million copies worldwide, 54 million copies in the U.S., and spawning no less than seven Top 10 hits and two No. 1 singles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But that complicated transition from youth to adulthood has left the star with many life lessons, a few scars and even a bit of wisdom.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On this day, as Michael&#39;s youngest child, Prince Michael Jackson II, 5--whom he affectionately calls &quot;Blanket&quot;--sits nearby watching cartoons and oblivious to the fuss everyone is making over his dad, Michael&#39;s life appears to have come full circle. (Jackson also has two other children, Paris Michael Katherine Jackson, 9, and Michael Joseph Jackson, Jr. 10.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">As Jackson introduces his son, he instructs him about proper etiquette to greet his guests. &quot;No, stand up and use THAT hand,&quot; he shows the boy, who is reluctant to put down his fistful of LifeSavers candy and shake hands.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In many ways, it is a very &quot;normal&quot; moment between a father and a son. And for Michael Jackson, after all his records and all the drama, that sense of normalcy--and maturity--seems to punctuate this phase of his life.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">With nearly a dozen solo albums, and more than a dozen more No. 1 singles, 13 Grammys and more than 750 million records sold worldwide in his career to date, Michael is humble about and proud of his influence on music history and the current music scene.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I always want to do music that influences and inspires each generation,&quot; he says. &quot;Let&#39;s face it, who wants mortality?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">You want what you create to live, and I give my all in my work because I want it to live.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today, it&#39;s virtually impossible to watch a music video without seeing a Michael Jackson-influenced dance step, music or theme. Justin Timberlake and Usher imitate his moves. Akon and Ne-Yo admire his sound.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Jackson reportedly has been working in the studio with Akon, Kanye West and William of the Black Eyed Peas on a new album, expected sometime in 2008.)</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Teen sensation Chris Brown paid tribute to Michael Jackson at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;There isn&#39;t an artist out now that hasn&#39;t been influenced or inspired by Michael Jackson. When I was 2 years old in diapers, I sang and danced to Michael Jackson,&quot; singer Brown tells EBONY. &quot;Michael Jackson is as close to perfection as an artist can be.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nevertheless, there was a certain poetic justice in that recent MTV tribute. It almost didn&#39;t happen.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In 1983, Jackson shattered an unwritten color barrier on MTV--initially the fledgling station was said to have refused to play his music videos. &quot;They came right out and said it--they wouldn&#39;t play my music. It broke my heart,&quot; Jackson says now.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But that, says Jackson, lit a fire in him. &quot;I refuse to be ignored. So I came up with Thriller and I was always trying to outdo myself,&quot; he remembers.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">When MTV supposedly said they wouldn&#39;t play Jackson&#39;s videos, Yetnikoff; head of CBS Records, fired back, &quot;&#39;OK, I&#39;m pulling Streisand, Chicago and everything else.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Before Thriller--and Bob Pittman [founder of MTV in 1982] disagrees with me, but Bob Pittman is full of s***, and you can quote me--when MTV first started, it held itself out as a rock station,&quot; Yetnikoff tells EBONY from his office in New York. &quot;And, when &#39;Billie Jean&#39; and &#39;Beat It&#39; came out, MTV didn&#39;t want to play it. They said, in effect, &#39;No, no, no, we&#39;re a rock kind of sensibility, and this is Michael Jackson and he&#39;s Black.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Although Pittman was not available to respond, Les Garland, co-founder and originator of MTV, VH1 and The Box told JET in 2006 that the story was a &quot;myth.&quot; &quot;There was never any hesitation. No fret. I called Bob [Pittman] to tell him, &#39;I just saw the greatest video I&#39;ve ever seen in my life [Billie Jean]. It is off the dial it&#39;s so good.&#39; He added it that day. How [the myth] turned into a story literally blew our minds.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, Yetnikoff, now 74, says he recalls the episode vividly. &quot;So I said, that&#39;s fine, but I am pulling my entire catalog, all my records, forget about it. You&#39;re not playing anything by CBS. And if that happened, you know Warner Brothers is going to follow suit.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">(Among CBS&#39; artists at the time were Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Living Colour and &quot;tons and tons of artists.&quot;) &quot;I said, &#39;C&#39;mon, you are acting like a bunch of schmucks,&#39;&quot; Yetnikoff laughs.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Legendary music producer Quincy Jones, who was friends with the late Steven J. Ross--creator of parent media company Time Warner and father of MTV--remembers the MTV negotiations a bit differently but, nevertheless, acknowledges the importance of the network and the star. &quot;The reality of it was that Michael and MTV rode each other to glory. Nobody had ever seen anything like that. And that can never happen again,&quot; says Jones.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think it was a milestone, in a sense, that I think it made MTV,&quot; adds Yetnikoff. &quot;It made Michael into something that I think had not existed before. And it made CBS Records a lot of money.&quot; Yetnikoff estimates the album was responsible for more than $500 million to $1 billion for the company. &quot;At one point, we were selling about a million records a week!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones, who produced the Thriller album, suggests one slightly less visible reason for the huge sales. &quot;You could listen to the record seven different ways, we&#39;d have seven different &#39;hooks.&#39; You don&#39;t get it all when you first listen to it. You&#39;d have to listen to it six or seven times,&quot; he adds. &quot;So when it was on vinyl, people would be wearing it out, buying three or four copies of the record, &#39;cause you couldn&#39;t listen to it all the first time.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Yetnikoff says that Michael and Thriller made his own career, too. &quot;I owe this guy,&quot; he says. &quot;HE may think he owes me, but it is pretty dear that I owe him.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">However, compared to Michael and the Thriller era, today&#39;s music, he added, is a different story altogether. &quot;It&#39;s like &#39;yucky-poo.&#39; If one more artist tries to sound like Michael Jackson, I am going to throw up!&quot; says Yetnikoff.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">And Michael seems to agree. &quot;I don&#39;t think people are being as experimental and innovative enough,&quot; he says. &quot;I know people can easily say, &#39;Well, we don&#39;t have the Michael Jackson budget,&#39;&quot; he laughs. &quot;Wrong, you can be so creative with almost nothing,&quot; Jackson adds. &quot;And that&#39;s usually the best stuff, when you strip it down to the bare minimum and go inside yourself and invent. I think there&#39;s too much cookie-cutter stuff.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Greg Phillinganes, a veteran arranger and keyboard player and a key musician on Thriller and many other Jackson projects, remembers working on the album.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;It was always special working with Quincy and Michael,&quot; he says. &quot;Those two bring out the best in everybody. You know going in that this is the A-Team so you have to bring the &#39;A&#39; game.&quot; Michael had strong musical goals and a strong sense of what he wanted to achieve artistically, he says, but the making of Thriller was also a very enjoyable experience. &quot;Quincy always brought fun into the room. He understands how to cast--like a casting director for a movie--he gets the right people for the right job, and Quincy does the same thing for music. It was a brilliant time. I just remember the fun of layering all the parts together, the bass and the strings and listening to Michael&#39;s vocals. We never saw the big sales coming. It was really very special, and Michael&#39;s performances speak for themselves.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">James Ingram, a veteran singer and another protege of Jones, says, &quot;Quincy is ruthless when it comes to music, he either thinks it&#39;s a hit or it&#39;s not, and he doesn&#39;t care who you are,&quot; says Ingram, who, with Jones, wrote &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing),&quot; a Top 10 hit from Thriller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Quincy&#39;s wife Peggy [Lipton] brought home some lingerie called &#39;Pretty Young Things&#39; and Quincy, being the genius that he is, said that would be a good title,&quot; Ingram recalls. Michael &quot;just killed the song&quot; in the studio recording, Ingram says, adding that he has never seen a performer dance through a recording session like Michael Jackson. &quot;Everybody I&#39;ve ever seen when they go into the studio, they put all of their energy into the microphone--but here was Michael in there singing his butt off and dancing at the same time. That blew my mind,&quot; Ingram says now. &quot;See, Quincy is not from this planet--he&#39;s a genius, and that&#39;s why he attracts all these geniuses [like Michael Jackson].&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson also credits Jones for creating the magical moments that fueled Thriller, Off the Wall and influenced the rest of his musical career. &quot;When I was 8 years old, Sammy Davis Jr. introduced me to Quincy Jones; I&#39;ll never forget it,&quot; Jackson says now. &quot;And I overheard him say to Quincy, &#39;This guy is something; he&#39;s amazing.&#39; I tucked it away subconsciously.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Years later he asked Jones to work with him on his albums. Their chemistry on the set of the 1978 film The Wiz sparked a golden collaboration. &quot;What&#39;s great about working with Quincy is he lets you do your thing ...&quot; Deliberate about the creative process, Jackson, who is a huge classical music fan, says, &quot;Once the tight chemistry gets in the room, magic has to happen.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">During the production of The Wiz, Jones saw something in Jackson he had never seen before. &quot;In the process, I got to see a side of him that was never exposed to the public before,&quot; Jones tells EBONY. &quot;I saw how smart he was, how sensitive, and that had never been represented on a record before.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Jones almost didn&#39;t do the project. &quot;You know Epic [Records, part of CBS] didn&#39;t want to use me ... They said, &#39;No way, Quincy&#39;s too jazzy.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But Michael pushed for the maestro, and, as they say, the rest is history.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Nearly every day, Jones sees the impact of the project across the globe. &quot;Look, I&#39;ve been around the world at least three times this year--Angkor Wat, Vietnam, Seoul, Rwanda, Cairo, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Moscow--and, man, you cannot tell what city you are in because at 12 o&#39;clock, they start kickin&#39; that music, and you will hear &#39;Wanna Be Startin&#39; Something&#39; or &#39;Don&#39;t Stop &#39;Til You Get Enough&#39; or &#39;Billie Jean.&#39; It blows my mind, like it was 25 years ago. I&#39;ve said it before: The &#39;80s were ours!&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson is a product of diverse creative forces, from Bach to Bo Diddley.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;Classical music, in truth, is really my real first love,&quot; Jackson reveals, and then adds &quot;that, and real Southern &#39;gutbucket,&#39; as my uncle calls it; you feel it in your backbone.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Not surprisingly, Michael has a very intimate relationship with his music. For him, it&#39;s all about the melody, and he does a rough &quot;template&quot; of all his songs. &quot;Getting the character of the riff like you want it takes a lot of work and a lot of time.&quot; He talks about the music as a protagonist, a story line. &quot;Music is tapestry, it&#39;s different layers, it&#39;s weaving in and out, and if you look at it in layers, you understand it better.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The King of Pop says working with Jones was so wonderful because &quot;he&#39;s genius enough to stay out of the way of the music. If something needs to be added, he would add it--like a nice riff. He would say, &#39;Smelly [a nickname Jones gave to Jackson], let the song talk to you. If a song needs strings, it will tell you. Get out of the way and leave room so that God can walk in.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jones agrees. &quot;That was my motto. You&#39;ve got to leave space for God to walk through the room. It&#39;s not about us. The older I get, the more I see how little we all have to do with anything, really.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Jackson&#39;s spirituality is another source of his creativity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I believe strongly in a higher force, and I&#39;m really thankful for all the blessings,&quot; he says. When he writes something that he knows is right, Jackson shares, he &quot;gets down on his knees&quot; and gives thanks.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">On August 29 of next year, Michael Jackson will be 50. He admits that, while still in excellent shape--he doesn&#39;t have any special diet and rarely works out--and more creative than ever, he is a different man than he was at 24. &quot;I always had this tug in the back of my head, the things I wanted to do, to raise children, have children. I&#39;m enjoying it very much.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">He says he travels with his three kids quite a bit, recently visiting South Africa. &quot;I just love Africa. They have lots for us to do. They have simulator tides, movie theaters, wave pools, we go to the record stores, the candy store, the bookstore, there&#39;s so much there.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Today&#39;s Michael is maturing. And those who know him best can see it. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has known Michael for most of his life, since the early Jackson 5 days. In 2005, he was in daily contact with Michael during the California trial, and today he serves as a private adviser to the superstar.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&quot;I think Michael is comfortable with himself,&quot; Rev. Jackson says. &quot;He knows he has a special genius and talent, and he knows he has a special responsibility. And he knows he is a superstar. He seems to have a great sense of self-control, but like any great star he&#39;s like an enigma to many people. But underneath all of that he is devoted to his mother and father and brothers and sisters. In all that, he&#39;s a Jackson.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Will Michael Jackson still be moonwalking at 80? No, he says, sternly. He doesn&#39;t want to grow old doing concert after concert, flying from one mega-stadium to the next. He just doesn&#39;t want to go out like that. &quot;Not the way James Brown did or Jackie Wilson did,&quot; he says. &quot;They just kept going, running, killing themselves. In my opinion, I wish [Brown] could have slowed down and relaxed and enjoyed his hard work.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael has other plans for his next 25 years. &quot;More in film, not on stage. I see myself more productive in film, and directing, and directing myself in film. Not so much [on stage] all over the world. Because [on stage] you&#39;re not capturing anything--it&#39;s fleeting. A concert is the most fleeting thing in the world. It&#39;s excellent to look at, but you can&#39;t capture it. With film you stop time.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">For Michael Jackson, time has never stopped. With each year, each challenge, each child and each success, he grows a little bit wiser.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Jackson has met the man in the mirror.

More than an entertainer, more than a singer or dancer, the grown-up father of three reveals a confident, controlled and mature man who has a lot of creativity left inside him.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Michael Joseph Jackson rocked the world in December 1982, when he exploded on the pop music scene with Thriller, the rich, rhythmic, infectious album that introduced many Whites to a talent that most Blacks had known for decades, and shattered nearly every industry record on the planet. The historic project was yet another, albeit giant, step in a musical career that began 18 years earlier, at age 6, with his brothers in the Jackson 5.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">In his first major U.S. magazine interview in a decade and on the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson sat down with EBONY magazine for a rare, intimate and exclusive conversation about the creation of Thriller, the historic Motown 25 performance, being a father, the state of the music industry and the force behind his creativity.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Here is Michael Jackson, in his own words ...</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Thriller: How did it all start?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Motown was preparing to do this movie called The Wiz and Quincy Jones happened to be the man who was doing the music. Now, I had heard of Quincy before. When I was in Indiana as a child, my father used to buy jazz albums, so I knew him as a jazz musician.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So after we had made this movie &ndash; we had gotten pretty close on the film, too; he helped me understand certain words, he was really fatherlike &ndash; I called him after the movie, out of complete sincerity &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m a shy person, ESPECIALLY then. I used to not even look at people when they were talking to me, I&rsquo;m not joking, and I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to do an album. Could you recommend anybody who would be interested in producing it with me or working with me?&rdquo; He paused and said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let ME do it?&rdquo; I said to myself, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rsquo; Probably because I was thinking that he was more my father, kind of jazzy. So after he said that, I said, &ldquo;WOW, that would be great.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s great about working with Quincy is he lets you do your thing. He doesn&rsquo;t get in the way.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">The first thing I came to him with was from Off the Wall, our first album, and Rod Temperton came in the studio, and he came with this killer &ndash; he&rsquo;s this little German guy from Worms, Germany &ndash; he comes with this &ldquo;doop, dakka dakka doop, dakka dakka dakka doop,&rdquo; this whole melody and chorus, &ldquo;rock with you.&rdquo; When I heard that, I said, &ldquo;OK, I really have to work now.&rdquo; So every time Rod would present something, I would present something, and we&rsquo;d form a little friendly competition. I love working like that. I used to read how Walt Disney used to, if they were working on Bambi or an animated show, put a deer in the middle of the floor and make the animators kind of compete with different styles of drawing. Whoever had the most stylized effect that Walt liked, he would pick that. They would kind of compete, it was like a friendly thing, but it was competition, &lsquo;cause it breeds higher effort. So whenever Rod would bring something, I would bring something, then he would bring something, then I would bring something else. We created this wonderful thing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So, after Off the Wall, in the spring of &rsquo;82, you went back in the studio to work on Thriller.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> After Off the Wall, we had all these No. 1 hits from it &ndash; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop &lsquo;Til You Get Enough,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock With You,&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Out of My Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;Workin&rsquo; Day and Night&rdquo; &ndash; and we were nominated for a Grammy award, but I was just not happy with how the whole thing happened because I wanted to do much more, present much more, put more of my soul and heart in it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Was it a transition point for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> A COMPLETE transition. Ever since I was a little boy, I would study composition. And it was Tchaikovsky that influenced me most. If you take an album like Nutcracker Suite, every song is a killer, every one. People used to do an album where you&rsquo;d one good song and the rest were like B-sides. They &lsquo;d call them &ldquo;album songs,&rdquo; and I would say to myself, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t every one be like a hit song? Why can&rsquo;t every song be so great that people would want to buy it if you could release it as a single?&rsquo; So I always tried to strive for that. That was my purpose for the next album. That was the whole idea. I wanted to just put any one out that we wanted. I worked hard for it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> The creative process, were you deliberate about that, or did it just kind of happen?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> No, I was pretty deliberate. Even though it all came together some kind of way, consciously, it was created in this universe, but once the right chemistry gets in the room, magic has to happen. It has to. It&rsquo;s like putting certain elements in one hemisphere and it produces this magic in the other. It&rsquo;s science. And getting in there with some of the great people, it&rsquo;s just wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But yeah, working with Quincy was such a wonderful thing. He lets you experiment, do the thing. He&rsquo;s genius enough to stay out of the way of the music, and if there&rsquo;s an element to be added, he&rsquo;ll add it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">We would work on a track and then we&rsquo;d meet at his house, play what we worked on, and he would say, &ldquo;If the song needs something, it&rsquo;ll tell you. Let it talk to you.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve learned to do that. The key to being a wonderful writer is not to write. You just get out of the way. Leave room for God to walk in the room. And when I write something that I know is right, I get on my knees and say thank you. Thank you, Jehovah!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> When&rsquo;s the last time you had that feeling?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Well, recently. I&rsquo;m always writing. When you know it&rsquo;s right, sometimes you feel like something&rsquo;s coming, a gestation, almost like a pregnancy or something. You get emotional, and you start to feel something gestating and, magic, there it is! It&rsquo;s an explosion or something that&rsquo;s so beautiful, you go, WOW! There it is. That&rsquo;s how it works through you. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. It&rsquo;s a universe of where you can go with those 12 notes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">[He&rsquo;s now listening to an early version of &ldquo;Billie Jean&rdquo; playing on an iPhone.]</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">What I do when I write is that I&rsquo;ll do a raggedy, rough version just to hear the chorus, just to see how much I like the chorus. If it works for me that way when it&rsquo;s raggedy, then I know it&rsquo;ll work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Listen to that, that&rsquo;s at home. Randy, Janet and I are going, &ldquo;whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.&rdquo; I do that, the same process, with every song. The melody is most important. If the melody can sell me, if I like the rough, then I&rsquo;ll go to the next step. If it sounds good in my head, it&rsquo;s usually good when I do it. The idea is to transcribe from what&rsquo;s in your mentality onto tape.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Another big moment was the Motown 25 performance.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I was at the studio editing &ldquo;Beat It,&rdquo; and for some reason I happened to be at Motown Studios doing it &ndash; I had long left the company. So they were getting ready to do something with the Motown anniversary, and Berry Gordy came by and asked me did I want to do the show I told him NO. I said no because the Thriller thing, I was building and creating something I was planning to do, and he said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the anniversary.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I will do it, but the only way I&rsquo;ll do it if you let me do one song that&rsquo;s not a Motown song.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Billie Jean.&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;OK, fine.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll really let me do &lsquo;Billie Jean?&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So I rehearsed and choreographed and dressed my brothers, and picked the songs and the medley. And not only that, you have to work out all the camera angles.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I direct and edit everything I do. Every shot you see is my shot. Let me tell you why I have to do it that way. I have five, no, six cameras. When you&rsquo;re performing &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t care what kind of performance you are giving &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t capture it properly, the people will never see it. It&rsquo;s the most selfish medium in the world. You&rsquo;re filming WHAT you want people to see, WHEN you want them to see it, HOW you want them to see it and what JUXTAPOSITION you want them to see.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> How long have you been creating all of those elements?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Since I was a little boy, with my brothers. My father used to say, &ldquo;Show &lsquo;em, Michael, show &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Did they ever get jealous of that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They never showed it at the time, but it must have been hard, because I would never get spanked during rehearsals or practice [laughter]. But afterwards was when I got in trouble [laughter]. It&#39;s true, that&#39;s when I would get it. My father would rehearse with a belt in his hand. You couldn&#39;t mess up. My father was a genius when it came to the way he taught us staging, how -to work an audience, anticipating what to do next, or never [to] let the audience know if you are suffering or if something&#39;s going wrong. He was amazing like that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Is that where you think you got not just a lot of your business sense but how to control the whole package?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Absolutely. My father, experience; but I learned a lot from my father. He had a group when he was a young person called the Falcons. They came over and they played music all the time, so we always had music and dancing. It&#39;s that cultural thing that Black people do. You clear out all the furniture, turn up the music. When company comes, everybody gets out in the middle of the floor [and] you gotta do something. I loved that.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Do your kids do that now?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They do, but they get shy: But they do it for me, sometimes.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> Speaking of showmanship: MTV didn&#39;t play Black folks. How hard was that for you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> They said they don&#39;t play [Black artists]. It broke my heart, but at the same time it lit something. I was saying to myself, &#39;I have to do something... I just refuse to be ignored.&#39; So yeah, &#39;&quot;Billie Jean,&#39;&quot; they said, &quot;We won&#39;t play it.&quot;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But when they played it, it set the all-time record. Then they were asking me for EVERYTHING we had. They were knocking our door down. Then Prince came; it opened the door for Prince and all the other Black artists. It was 24-hour heavy metal, just a pot&not;pourri of crazy images. They came to me so many times in the past and said, &quot;Michael, if it wasn&#39;t for you. there would be no MTV.&quot; They told me that over and over, personally. I guess they didn&#39;t hear it at the time, but I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t mean any pure malice [laughter].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> That really gave birth to the modern video age.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> I used to look at MTV. My brother [Jackie], I&#39;ll never forget, he&#39;d say, &quot;Michael, you gotta see this channel. Oh my God, it&#39;s the best idea. They show music 24 hours a day!&quot; So I said, &quot;Let me see this.&quot; And I&#39;m watching it, I&#39;m seeing all this stuff going on and saying, &quot;If only they could give this stuff some more entertainment value, more story, a little more dance, I&#39;m sure people would love it more.&quot; I said, &quot;When I do something, it&#39;s gotta have a story &ndash; an opening, a middle and a closing&mdash;so you can follow a linear thread; there&#39;s got to be a thread through it. So while you are watching the entertainment value of it, you&#39;re wondering what is going to happen.&quot; That&#39;s when I started to experiment with &quot;Thriller,&quot; &quot;The Way YOU Make Me Feel,&quot; &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and directing and writing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> What do you think about the state of music videos and music today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> [The industry], it&#39;s at a crossroads. There&#39;s a transformation going on. People are confused, what&#39;s going to happen, how to distribute and sell music. I think the Internet kind of threw everybody for a real loop, &#39;cause it&#39;s so powerful, kids love it so much. The whole world is at their fingertips, on their lap. Anything they want to know, anyone they want to communicate with, any music, any movies. This thing, it just took everybody for a loop. Right now, all these Starbucks deals and Wal-Mart deals, direct to artist, I don&rsquo;t know if that&#39;s the answer. I think the answer is just phenomenal, great music. Just reaching the masses. I think people are still searching. There&#39;s not a real musical revolution going on right now either. But when it&#39;s there, people will break a wall down to get to it. I mean, before Thriller, it was the same kind of thing. People were NOT buying music. It helped to bring everybody back into the stores. So, when it happens, it happens.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Who impresses you?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">As far as artistry, I think Ne-Yo is doing wonderful. But he has a very Michael Jackson feel, too. But that&#39;s what I like about him. I can tell that he&#39;s a guy who understands writing.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Do you work with these young artists?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Sure. I&#39;ve always been the type where, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the mailman or the guy sweeping the floor. If it&#39;s a great song, it&#39;s a great song. Some of the most ingenious ideas come from everyday people, who just go, &#39;Why don&#39;t you try this, or do this.&#39; It&#39;ll be a wonderful idea, so you should just try it. Chris Brown is wonderful. Akon, he&#39;s a wonderful artist.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I always want to do music that inspires or influences another generation. You want what you create to live, be it sculpture or painting or music. Like Michelangelo, he said, &ldquo;I know the creator will go, but his work survives. That is why to escape death, I attempt to bind my soul to my work.&rdquo; And that&#39;s how I feel. I give my all to my work. I want it to just live.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">How does it feel to know you have changed history? Do you think about that a lot?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Yeah, I do, I really do. I&#39;m very proud that we opened doors, that it helped tear down a lot. Going around the world, doing tours, in stadiums, you see the influence of the music. When you just look out over the stage, as far as the naked eye could see, you see people. And it&#39;s a wonderful feeling, but it came with a lot of pain, a lot of pain.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">How so?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">When you&#39;re on top of your game, when you&#39;re a pioneer, people come at you. It&#39;s there, who&#39;s at the top, you want to get at them.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But I feel grateful, all those record-breaking things, to the biggest albums, to those No. 1s, I still feel grateful. I&#39;m a guy who used to sit in my living room and listen to my father play Ray Charles. My mother used to wake me up at 3 in the morning, &#39;Michael, he&#39;s on TV, he&#39;s on TV!&#39; I&#39;d run to the TV and James Brown would be on TV. I said, &#39;That&#39;s what I want to do.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Can we expect more of Michael Jackson?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m writing a lot of stuff right now. I&#39;m in the studio, like, every day. I think, like, the rap thing that is happening now, when it first came out, I always felt that it was gonna take more of a melodic structure to make it more universal, &#39;cause not everybody speaks English. [Laughter] And you are limited to your country. But when you can have a melody, and everybody can hum a melody, then that&#39;s when it became France, The Middle East, everywhere! All over the world now &#39;cause they put that melodic, linear thread in there. You have to be able to hum it, from the farmer in Ireland to the lady who scrubs toilets in Harlem to anybody who can whistle to a child poppin&#39; their fingers. You have to be able to hum it.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY:</span><span class="csD5D7D290"> So, you&#39;re almost 50 now. Do you think you&#39;ll be doing this at 80?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">The truth is, umm, no. Not the way James Brown did, or Jackie Wilson did, where they just ran it out, they killed themselves. In my opinion, I wish [Brown] could have slowed down and been more relaxed and enjoyed his hard work.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Will you tour again?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t care about long tours. But what I love about touring is that it sharpens one&#39;s craft beautifully. That&#39;s what I love about Broadway, that&#39;s why actors turn to Broadway, to sharpen their skills. It does do that. &#39;Cause it takes years to become a great entertainer. Years. You can&#39;t just grab some guy out of obscurity and throw &#39;em out there and expect for this person to compete with that person. It&#39;ll never work. And the audience knows it; they can see it. The way they gesture their hand, move their body, the way they do anything with the microphone, or the way they bow. They can see it right away.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">Now Stevie Wonder, he&#39;s a musical prophet. He&#39;s another guy I have to credit. I used to say to myself, &#39;I want to write more.&#39; I used to watch [producers] Gamble and Huff, and Hal Davis and The Corporation write all those hits for the Jackson 5 and I really wanted to study the anatomy. What they used to do, they used to have us come in and sing after they did the track. I used to get upset &#39;cause I would want to see them make the track. So they would give me &ldquo;ABC&rdquo; after the track was done, or &ldquo;I Want You Back&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Love You Save.&rdquo; I wanted to experience it all.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">So Stevie Wonder used to literally let me sit like a fly on the wall. I got to see Songs in the Key of Life get made, some of the most golden things. I would sit with Marvin Gaye and just&hellip;and these would be the people who would just come over to our house and hang out and play basketball with my brothers on the weekend. We always had these people around. So when you really can see the science, the anatomy and the structure of how it all works, it&#39;s just so wonderful.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">So, you play on a world stage. How do you see the shape of the world today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m very concerned about the plight of the international global warming phenomenon. I knew it was coming, but I wish they would have gotten people&#39;s interest sooner. But it&#39;s never too late. It&#39;s been described as a runaway train; if we don&#39;t stop it, we&#39;ll never get it back. So we have to fix it, now. That&#39;s what I was trying to do with &ldquo;Earth Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heal the World,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Are the World,&rdquo; writing those songs to open up people&#39;s consciousness. I wish people would listen to every word.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">What do you think about the next presidential race? Hillary, Barack?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">To tell you the truth, I don&#39;t follow that stuff. We were raised to not&hellip;we don&#39;t look to man to fix the problems of the world, we don&#39;t. They can&#39;t do it. That&#39;s how I see it. It&#39;s beyond us. Look, we don&#39;t have control over the grounds, they can shake. We don&#39;t have control over the seas, they can have tsunamis. We don&#39;t have control over the skies, there are storms. We&#39;re all in God&#39;s hands. I think that man has to take that into consideration. I just wish they would do more for the babies and children, help them more. That would be great, wouldn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">Speaking of babies, as a father now, rewind back 25 years ago. What is the difference between that Michael and the Michael today?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">That Michael is probably the same Michael here. I just wanted to get certain things accomplished first. But I always had this tug in the back of my head, the things I wanted to do, to raise children, have children. I&#39;m enjoying it very much.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">EBONY: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">What do you think about all the stuff that&#39;s out there about you, all the things you read? How do you feel about that?</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs31D24DEE">MICHAEL: </span><span class="csD5D7D290">I don&#39;t pay attention to that. In my opinion, it&#39;s ignorance. It&#39;s usually not based on fact. It&#39;s based on, you know, myth. The guy who you don&#39;t get to see. Every neighborhood has the guy who you don&#39;t see, so you gossip about him. You see those stories about him, there&#39;s the myth that he did this or he did that. People are crazy!</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I&#39;m just about wanting to do wonderful music.</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">But back to Motown 25, one of the things that touched me the most about doing that was, after I did the performance&mdash;I&#39;ll never forget. There was Marvin Gaye in the wings, and the Temptations and Smokey Robinson and my brothers, they were hugging me and kissing me and holding me. Richard Pryor walked over to me and said [in a quiet voice], &#39;Now that was the greatest performance I&#39;ve ever seen.&#39; That was my reward. These were people who, when I was a little boy in Indiana, I used to listen to Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, and to have them bestow that kind of appreciation on me, I was just honored. Then the next day, Fred Astaire calls and said, &#39;I watched it last night, and I taped it, and I watched it again this morning. You&#39;re a helluva mover. You put the audience on their ASS last night!&#39; So, later, when I saw Fred Astaire, he did this with his fingers [He makes a little moonwalk gesture with his two fingers on his outstretched palm].</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I remember doing the performance so clearly, and I remembered that I was so upset with myself, &lsquo;cause it wasn&#39;t what I wanted. I wanted it to be more. But not until I finished. It was a little child, a little Jewish child backstage with a little tuxedo on, he looked at me, and he said [in a stunned voice] &#39;Who taught you to move like that?&#39; [Laughter] And I said, &#39;I guess God&hellip; and rehearsal.&#39;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="cs76EFAA84">Michael Jackson, <a class="cs76EFAA84" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808121410/http://www.the-michael-jackson-archives.com/jetdec24.html"><span class="cs8567212B">&ldquo;Jet&rdquo; magazine (December 24-31, 2007)</span></a></span></p><p class="csFEEEEB43"><span class="csD5D7D290">I feel grateful, all those record-breaking things, to the biggest albums, to those number ones, I still feel grateful.</span></p></body>
